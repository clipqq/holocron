 About the B ook 
Much  more  than  just  a  memoir,  this  is  Richard  Branson’s  own  take  on  his  extraordinary  life  so  far   – 
and a definitive business guide that reveals his unique philosophy on commerce, success and life.  
Richard looks back on how Virgin grew from a mail -order music business into the global brand it is 
today, and how, rather like his balloon flights, the years have been as much about endurance and 
survival as they have been about runaway success. He shares the inside story of his latest projects in 
the areas o f health, the environment and the media, as well as his reflections on his own intrepid 
adventures and family life.  
From the $25 million Virgin Earth Challenge to the launch of Virgin Galactic, this is a powerful and 
unique inside look into the life of an iconic global entrepreneur.

LOSING MY VIRGINITY  
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY  
 
Dedicated to Alex Ritchie and his family  
 
A special thank -you to Edward Whitley for helping me pull this project together. Edward spent 
two years in my company, practically lived in my house, waded through 25 years of scribbled 
notebooks and helped bring them to life.  
Prologue  
‘Screw  it.  Let’s  do  it.’  
Tuesday 7 January 1997, Morocco  
5.30a.m.  
I WOKE BEFORE JOAN  and sat up in bed. From across Marrakech I heard the wavering cry of the 
muezzins  calling  people  to  prayer  over  the  loudspeakers.  I  still  hadn’t  written  to  Holly  and  Sam,  so  I  
tore  a  page  out  of  my  notebook  and  wrote  them  a  letter  in  case  I  didn’t  return.  
Dear Holly and Sam,  
Life can seem rather unreal at times. Alive and well and loving one day. No longer there the 
next. 
As you both know I always had an urge to live life to its full. That meant I was lucky 
enough to live the life of many people during my 4 6 years. I loved every minute of it and I 
especially loved every second of my time with both of you and Mum.  
I know that many people thought us foolish for embarking on this latest adventure. I was 
convinced they were wrong. I felt that everything we had l earnt from our Atlantic and Pacific 
adventures  would  mean  that  we’d  have  a  safe  flight.  I  thought  that  the  risks  were  acceptable.  
Obviously  I’ve  been  proved  wrong.  
However, I regret nothing about my life except not being with Joan to finally help you grow 
up.  By  the  ages  of  twelve  and  fifteen  your  characters  have  already  developed.  We’re  both  so  
proud  of  you.  Joan  and  I  couldn’t  have  had  two  more  delightful  kids.  You  are  both  kind,  
considerate, full of life (even witty!). What more could we both want?  
Be st rong.  I  know  it  won’t  be  easy.  But  we’ve  had  a  wonderful  life  together  and  you’ll  never  
forget  all  the  good  times  we’ve  had.  
Live  life  to  its  full  yourselves.  Enjoy  every  minute  of  it.  Love  and  look  after  Mum  as  if  she’s  
both of us.  
I love you,  
Dad 
I folded the letter into a small square and put it in my pocket. Fully clothed and ready, I lay down 
beside Joan and hugged her. While I felt wide awake and nervous, she felt warm and sleepy in my 
arms. Holly and Sam came into our room and cuddled into bed  between us. Then Sam slipped off with 
his cousins to go to the launch site and see the balloon in which I hoped shortly to fly round the world. 
Joan and Holly stayed with me while I spoke to Martin, the meteorologist. The flight, he said, was 
definitely o n – we had the best weather conditions for five years. I then called Tim Evans, our doctor. 
He  had  just  been  with  Rory  McCarthy,  our  third  pilot,  and  had  bad  news:  Rory  couldn’t  fly.  He  had  
mild pneumonia, and if he was in a capsule for three weeks it coul d get much worse. I immediately 
called up Rory and commiserated with him.  
‘See  you  in  the  dining  room,’  I  said.  ‘Let’s  have  breakfast.’  
6.20a.m.  
By the time Rory and I met in the hotel dining room, it was deserted. The journalists who had been 
following th e preparations for the launch over the previous 24 hours had already left for the launch 
site. 
Rory and I met and hugged each other. We both cried. As well as becoming a close friend as our 
third pilot on the balloon flight, Rory and I had been joining for ces recently on a number of business 
deals. Just before we had come out to Morocco, he had bought a share in our new record label, V2, 
and had invested in Virgin Clothes and Virgin Vie, our new cosmetics company.  
‘I  can’t  believe  I’m  letting  you  down,’  Ror y  said.  ‘I’m  never  ill   – never,  ever.’  
‘Don’t  worry,’  I  assured  him.  ‘It  happens.  We’ve  got  Alex,  who  weighs  half  what  you  do.  We’ll  
fly  far  further  with  him  on  board.’  
‘Seriously,  if  you  don’t  come  back,’  Rory  said,  ‘I’ll  carry  on  where  you  left  off.’  ‘Well,  thanks!’  I  said,  laughing  nervously.  
Alex Ritchie was already out at the launch site supervising the mad dash to get the capsule ready 
with Per Lindstrand, the veteran hot -air balloonist who had introduced me to the sport. Alex was the 
brilliant engine er who had designed the capsule. Until then, nobody had succeeded in building a 
system that sustained balloon flights at jet -stream levels. Although it was he who had built both our 
Atlantic  and  Pacific  capsules,  I  didn’t  know  him  well,  and  it  was  too  late  to find out much about him 
now. Despite having no flight training, Alex had bravely made the decision to come with us. If all 
went  well  with  the  flight,  we’d  have  about  three  weeks  to  get  to  know  each  other.  About  as  intimately  
as any of us would want.  
Unlike my crossings with Per of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans by hot -air balloon, on this trip 
we would not heat air until we needed to: the balloon had an inner core of helium which would take us 
up.  Per’s  plan  was  to  heat  the  air  around  that  core  during   the night, which in turn would heat the 
helium, which would otherwise contract, grow heavy and sink.  
Joan, Holly and I held hands and the three of us embraced. It was time to go.  
8.30a.m.  
We all saw it at the same time. As we drove along the dirt road out to the Moroccan air base, it looked 
as if a new mosque had sprouted overnight. Above the bending, dusty palm trees, a stunning white orb 
rose up like a mother -of-pearl dome. It was the balloon. Men on horseback galloped along the side of 
the road, guns slu ng over their shoulders, heading for the air base. Everyone was drawn to this huge, 
gleaming white balloon hanging in the air, tall and slender.  
9.15a.m.  
The balloon was cordoned off, and round the perimeter railing was an amazing collection of people. 
The entire complement of the air base stood off to one side in serried ranks, dressed in smart navy -
blue uniforms. In front of them was the traditional Moroccan collection of dancing women in white 
shawls, hollering, wailing and whooping. Then a group of hors emen dressed in Berber costume and 
brandishing antique muskets galloped into view and lined up in front of the balloon. For an awful 
moment, I thought they would fire a celebratory salvo and puncture the balloon. Per, Alex and I 
gathered in the capsule and  did a final check of all the systems. The sun was rising rapidly and the 
helium was beginning to expand.  
10.15a.m.  
We had done all the checks, and were ready to go. I hugged Joan, Holly and Sam one last time. I was 
amazed  at  Joan’s  strength.  Holly  had  bee n by my side for the last four days, and she too appeared to 
be totally in control of the situation. I thought that Sam was as well, but then he burst into tears and 
pulled me towards him, refusing to let go. I almost started crying with him. I will never forget the 
anguished strength of his hug. Then he kissed me, let go and hugged Joan. I ran across to kiss Mum 
and  Dad  goodbye.  Mum  pressed  a  letter  into  my  hand.  ‘Open  it  after  six  days,’  she  said.  I  silently  
hoped we would last that long.  
10.50a.m.  There was nothing left to do except climb up the steel steps into the capsule. For a second I hesitated 
and wondered when and where I would put my feet back on solid ground – or water. There was no 
time to think ahead. I stepped in through the hatch. Per w as by the main controls; I sat by the camera 
equipment and Alex sat in the seat by the trap door.  
11.19a.m.  
Ten,  nine,  eight,  seven,  six,  five  …  Per  counted  down  and  I  concentrated  on  working  the  cameras.  My  
hand kept darting down to check my parachute buc kle. I tried not to think about the huge balloon 
above  us,  and  the  six  vast  fuel  tanks  strapped  round  our  capsule.  Four,  three,  two,  one  …  and  Per  
threw the lever which fired the bolts which severed the anchor cables and we lifted silently and swiftly 
into the  sky.  There  was  no  roar  of  the  burners:  our  ascent  was  like  that  of  a  child’s  party  balloon.  We  
just rose up, up and away and then, as we caught the morning breeze, we headed over Marrakech.  
The emergency door was still open as we soared up, and we wav ed down at the, by now, little 
people. Every detail of Marrakech, its square pink walls, the large town square, the green courtyards 
and fountains hidden behind high walls, was laid out below us. By 10,000 feet it became cold and the 
air grew thin. We shut  the trap door. From now on we were on our own. We were pressurised, and the 
pressure would mount.  
Our first fax came through the machine just after midday.  
‘Oh  God!’  Per  handed  it  over.  ‘Look  at  this.’  
‘Please  be  aware  that  the  connectors  on  the  fuel  tank s  are  locked  on,’  I  read.  
This was our first mistake. The connectors should have been locked off so that, if we got into 
trouble and started falling, we could jettison a one -ton fuel tank by way of ballast.  
‘If  that’s  our  only  mistake,  we’re  not  doing  badl y,’  I  said,  in  an  attempt  to  cheer  Per  up.  
‘We  need  to  get  down  to  5,000  feet  and  then  I’ll  climb  out  and  unlock  them,’  Alex  said.  ‘It’s  not  
a  problem.’ 
It was impossible to lose height during the day because the sun was heating the helium. The only 
immedi ate solution was to release helium, which, once released, would be impossible to regain. We 
couldn’t  afford  to  lose  any  helium.  So  we  agreed  to  wait  for  nightfall  to  bring  the  balloon  down.  It  was  
a  nagging  worry.  We  didn’t  know  how  this  balloon  would  fly   at night, and with our fuel tanks locked 
on our ability to escape trouble was limited.  
Although Alex and I tried to brush off the problem of the locked canisters, it sent Per into a fierce 
depression. He sat slumped by the controls in a furious silence, sp eaking only when we asked him a 
direct question.  
We flew serenely for the rest of the day. The views over the Atlas Mountains were exhilarating, 
their jagged peaks capped with snow gleaming up at us in the glorious sunshine. The capsule was 
cramped, full o f supplies to last us eighteen days. It emerged that failing to lock off the connectors was 
not  the  only  thing  we’d  forgotten.  We’d  also  neglected  to  pack  any  lavatory  paper,  so  we  had  to  wait  to receive faxes before we could go down the tiny spiral stairc ase to the loo. And my Moroccan 
stomach was in need of a lot of faxes. Per maintained his glowering silence, but Alex and I were just 
grateful that we knew about the canisters then rather than finding out the hard way.  
As we approached the Algerian border we had a second shock when the Algerians informed us 
that we were heading straight for Béchar, their top military base. They told us that we could not fly 
over  it:  ‘You  are  not,  repeat  not,  authorised  to  enter  this  area,’  said  the  fax.  
We had no choice.  
I spent about two hours on the satellite phone to Mike Kendrick, our flight controller, and tried 
various British ministers. Eventually André Azoulay, the Moroccan minister who had ironed out all 
our problems for the launch in Morocco, came to the rescue aga in. He explained to the Algerians that 
we could not change our direction and that we did not have powerful cameras on board. They accepted 
this, and relented.  
As the good news came through, I scribbled down notes in my logbook. As I turned over another 
page,  there  was  a  handwritten  note  from  Sam,  in  thick  black  ink  and  Sellotaped  to  the  page:  ‘To  Dad,  I  
hope  you  have  a  great  time.  Safe  journey.  Lots  and  lots  of  love,  your  son  Sam.’  I  recalled  that  he’d  
slipped into the capsule without me the previous night,  and now I knew why.  
By 5p.m. we were still flying at 30,000 feet. Per started firing the burners to heat the air inside 
the envelope. Although we burnt for an hour, just after 6p.m. the balloon started losing height steadily.  
‘Something’s  wrong  with  the  t heory  here,’  Per  said.  
‘What’s  the  matter?’  I  asked.  
‘I  don’t  know.’  
Per was firing the burners continuously, but the balloon was still heading down. We lost 1,000 
feet, and then another 500 feet. It was getting colder all the time as the sun disappeared. It was clear 
that the helium was rapidly contracting, becoming a dead weight on top of us.  
‘We’ve  got  to  dump  ballast,’  Per  said.  He  was  frightened.  We  all  were.  
We pulled levers to dump the lead weights which were on the bottom of the capsule. These were 
meant to be held in reserve for about two weeks. They fell away from the capsule and I saw them on 
my video screen dropping like bombs. I had a horrible feeling that this was just the start of a disaster. 
The capsule was bigger than the Atlantic and Pacifi c ones, but it was still a metal box hanging off a 
giant balloon, at the mercy of the winds and weather.  
It was now getting dark. Without the lead weights, we steadied for a while, but then the balloon 
started falling once more. This time the fall was fast er. We dropped 2,000 feet in one minute; 2,000 
feet the next. My ears went numb and then popped, and I felt my stomach rising up, pressing against 
my ribcage. We were at only 15,000 feet. I tried to stay calm, focusing intently on the cameras and the 
altim eter, rapidly going through the options available. We needed to jettison the fuel tanks. But, as 
soon as we did so, the trip was over. I bit my lip. We were somewhere over the Atlas Mountains in darkness, and we were heading for a horrible crash -landing. N one of us spoke. I made some rapid 
calculations.  
‘At  this  rate  of  fall  we’ve  got  seven  minutes,’  I  said.  
‘OK,’  Per  said.  ‘Open  the  hatch.  Depressurise.’  
We opened the trap door at 12,000 feet, dropping to 11,000 feet, and with a breathtaking rush of 
freezing air the capsule depressurised. Alex and I started throwing everything overboard: food, water, 
oil  cans,  anything  that  wasn’t  built  into  the  capsule.  E verything. Even a wodge of dollars. For five 
minutes, this stalled our fall. There was no question of continuing. We just had to save our lives.  
‘It’s  not  enough,’  I  said,  seeing  the  altimeter  drop  to  9,000  feet.  ‘We’re  still  falling.’  
‘OK,  I’m  going  out  on  the  roof,’  Alex  said.  ‘The  fuel  tanks  have  got  to  go.’  
Since Alex practically built the capsule, he knew exactly how to undo the locks. In the panic I 
realised  that,  if  Rory  had  been  on  board  instead,  we’d  have  been  stuck.  We  would  ha ve had no choice 
but  to  parachute.  Right  now  we’d  be  tumbling  out  into  the  night  over  the  Atlas  Mountains.  The  
burners roared overhead, casting a fierce orange light over us.  
‘Have  you  parachuted  before?’  I  shouted  at  Alex.  
‘Never,’  he  said.  
‘That’s  your  r ipcord,’  I  said,  pushing  his  hand  to  it.  
‘It’s  7,000  feet  and  falling,’  Per  called  out.  ‘6,600  feet  now.’  
Alex climbed through the hatch, on to the top of the capsule. It was difficult to feel how fast we 
were dropping. My ears had now blocked. If the lock s  were  frozen  and  Alex  wasn’t  able  to  free  the  
fuel  cans,  we’d  have  to  jump.  We  had  only  a  few  minutes  left.  I  looked  up  at  the  hatch  and  rehearsed  
what we would have to do: one hand to the rim, step out, and jump into the darkness. My hand 
instinctively f elt for my parachute. I checked to see that Per was wearing his. Per was watching the 
altimeter. The numbers were falling fast.  
We had only 6,000 feet to play with and it was dark – no, 5,500 feet. If Alex was up there for 
another  minute,  we’d  have  3,500  f eet. I stood with my head through the hatch, paying out the strap 
and watching Alex as he worked his way round the top of the capsule. It was pitch -dark below us and 
freezing  cold.  We  couldn’t  see  the  ground.  The  phone  and  fax  were  ringing  incessantly.  Gro und 
control must have been wondering what the hell we were doing.  
‘One’s  off,’  Alex  shouted  through  the  hatch.  
‘3,700  feet,’  Per  said.  
‘Another  one,’  Alex  said.  
‘3,400  feet.’  ‘Another  one.’  
‘2,900  feet,  2,400.’  
It  was  too  late  to  bale  out.  By  the  time  we’d  jumped,  we’d  be  smashing  into  the  mountains  
rushing up to meet us.  
‘Get  back  in,’  Per  yelled.  ‘Now.’  
Alex fell back through the hatch.  
We  braced  ourselves.  Per  threw  the  lever  to  disconnect  a  fuel  tank.  If  this  bolt  failed,  we’d  be  
dead in about sixty sec onds. The tank dropped away and the balloon jerked to an abrupt halt. It felt 
like an elevator hitting the ground. We were flattened into our seats, my head crammed down into my 
shoulders. Then the balloon began to rise. We watched the altimeter: 2,600, 2, 700, 2,800 feet. We 
were safe. In ten minutes we were up past 3,000 feet and the balloon was heading back into the night 
sky. 
I knelt on the floor beside Alex and hugged him.  
‘Thank  God  you’re  with  us,’  I  said.  ‘We’d  be  dead  without  you.’  
They say that a d ying man reviews his life in the final seconds before his death. In my case this 
was not true. As we hurtled down towards becoming a fireball on the Atlas Mountains and I thought 
that we were going to die, all I could think of was that, if I escaped with m y life, I would never do this 
again. As we rose up towards safety, Alex told us a story of a rich man who set out to swim the 
Channel: he went down to the beach, set up his deck chair and a table laid with cucumber sandwiches 
and strawberries, and then ann ounced that his man would now swim the Channel for him. At that 
moment,  it  didn’t  sound  like  such  a  bad  idea.  
Throughout that first night, we fought to keep control of the balloon. At one point it started a 
continuous ascent, rising for no apparent reason.  We finally realised that one of the remaining fuel 
tanks had sprung a leak: we had been unwittingly jettisoning fuel. As dawn approached, we made 
preparations to land. Below was the Algerian desert, an inhospitable place at the best of times, more so 
in a country in the middle of a civil war.  
The desert was not the yellow sandy sweep of soft dunes which you expect from watching 
Lawrence of Arabia . The bare earth was red and rocky, as barren as the surface of Mars, the rocks 
standing upright like vast termi tes’  nests.  Alex  and  I  sat  up  on  the  roof  of  the  capsule,  marvelling  at  
the dawn as it broke over the desert. We were aware this was a day that we might not have survived to 
see. The rising sun and the growing warmth of the day seemed infinitely precious. Watching the 
balloon’s  shadow  slip  across  the  desert  floor,  it  was  hard  to  believe  it  was  the  same  contraption  that  
had plummeted towards the Atlas Mountains in the middle of the night.  
The still -attached  fuel  tanks  were  blocking  Per’s  view,  so  Alex  talked  him in to land. As we 
neared the ground Alex shouted out:  
‘Power  line  ahead!’  Per  shouted  back  that  we  were  in  the  middle  of  the  Sahara  and  there  couldn’t  possibly  be  a  power  
line.  ‘You  must  be  seeing  a  mirage,’  he  bawled.  
Alex insisted that he come up an d see for himself: we had managed to find the only power line in 
the Sahara.  
Despite the vast barren desert all around us, within minutes of our landing there were signs of 
life. A group of Berber tribesmen materialised from the rocks. At first they kept t heir distance. We 
were about to offer them some water and the few remaining supplies, when we heard the clattering 
roar of gunship helicopters. They must have tracked us on their radar. As quickly as they had 
appeared, the Berber vanished. Two helicopters landed close by, throwing up clouds of dust, and soon 
we were surrounded by impassive soldiers holding machine guns, apparently unsure where to point 
them. 
‘Allah,’  I  said,  encouragingly.  
For a moment they stood still, but their curiosity got the better of them and they came forward. 
We showed their officer around the capsule, and he marvelled at the remaining fuel tanks.  
As we stood outside the capsule, I wondered what these Algerian soldi ers thought of it. I looked 
back, and saw it for a moment through their eyes. The remaining fuel tanks were painted like vast cans 
of Virgin Cola and Virgin Energy in bright red and yellow. Among the many slogans on the side of 
the capsule were ones for Vi rgin Atlantic, Virgin Direct (now Virgin Money), Virgin Territory and 
Virgin Cola. It was probably lucky for us that the devoutly Muslim soldiers could not understand the 
writing round the top of the Virgin Energy can: DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD 
THERE  IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT VIRGIN ENERGY IS AN APHRODISIAC.  
* * *  
As I looked at the capsule standing in the red sand, and relived the harrowing drop towards the Atlas 
Mountains, I renewed my vow that I would never attempt this again. In perfect contr adiction to this, at 
the back of my mind I also knew that, as soon as I was home and had talked to the other balloonists 
who  were  trying  to  fly  round  the  world,  I  would  agree  to  have  one  last  go.  It’s  an  irresistible  challenge  
and  it’s  now  buried  too  deepl y inside for me to give up.  
The two questions I am most often asked are, Why do you risk your neck ballooning? and, Where 
is the Virgin Group going? In some ways the sight of the ballooning capsule standing in the middle of 
the Algerian desert, with its cl uster of Virgin names plastered over it, summed up these prime 
questions.  
I  knew  that  I  would  attempt  another  balloon  flight  because  it’s  one  of  the  few  great  challenges  
left.  As  soon  as  I’ve  banished  the  terrors  of  each  actual  flight,  I  once  again  feel  co nfident that we can 
learn from our mistakes and achieve the next one safely.  
The wider question of where the Virgin Group will end up is impossible to answer. Rather than 
be too academic about it all, which is not the way I think, I have written this book to demonstrate how 
we made Virgin what it is today. If you read carefully between the lines you will, I hope, understand what our vision for the Virgin Group is, and you will see where I am going. Some people say that my 
vision for Virgin breaks all the ru les and is too wildly kaleidoscopic; others say that Virgin has 
become one of the leading brand names of the century; others analyse it down to the last degree and 
then write academic papers on it. As for me, I just pick up the phone and get on with it. Bo th the series 
of balloon flights and the numerous Virgin companies I have set up form a seamless series of 
challenges which I can date from my childhood.  
When I was searching for titles, David Tait, who runs the American side of Virgin Atlantic, suggested 
that I call it Virgin: The Art of Business Strategy and Competitive Analysis . 
‘Not  bad,’  I  told  him,  ‘but  I’m  not  sure  it’s  catchy  enough.’  
‘Of  course,’  he  said,  ‘the  subtitle  would  be   Oh  Screw  It,  Let’s  Do  It .’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1 ‘A  family  that  would  have  killed  for  each  other.’  
1950 –1963  
MY CHILDHOOD IS SOMETHING  of a blur to me now, but there are several episodes that stand 
out. I do remember that my parents continually set us challenges. My mother was determined to make 
us indep endent. When I was four years old, she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made 
me  find  my  own  way  home  across  the  fields.  I  got  hopelessly  lost.  My  youngest  sister  Vanessa’s  
earliest memory is being woken up in the dark one January morning beca use Mum had decided I 
should cycle to Bournemouth that day. Mum packed some sandwiches and an apple and told me to 
find some water along the way.  
Bournemouth was fifty miles away from our home in Shamley Green, Surrey. I was under 
twelve, but Mum thought t hat it would teach me the importance of stamina and a sense of direction. I 
remember setting off in the dark, and I have a vague recollection of staying the night with a relative. I 
have no idea how I found their house, or how I got back to Shamley Green t he next day, but I do 
remember finally walking into the kitchen like a conquering hero, feeling tremendously proud of my 
marathon bike ride and expecting a huge welcome.  
‘Well  done,  Ricky,’  Mum  greeted  me  in  the  kitchen,  where  she  was  chopping  onions.  ‘Was  that 
fun?  Now,  could  you  run  along  to  the  vicar’s?  He’s  got  some  logs  he  wants  chopping  and  I  told  him  
that  you’d  be  back  any  minute.’  
Our challenges tended to be physical rather than academic, and soon we were setting them for 
ourselves. I have an early memory of learning how to swim. I was either four or five, and we had been 
on  holiday  in  Devon  with  Dad’s  sisters,  Auntie  Joyce  and  Aunt  Wendy,  and  Wendy’s  husband,  Uncle  
Joe. I was particularly fond of Auntie Joyce, and at the beginning of the holiday she  had bet me ten 
shillings  that  I  couldn’t  learn  to  swim  by  the  end  of  the  fortnight.  I  spent  hours  in  the  sea  trying  to  
swim against the freezing -cold  waves,  but  by  the  last  day  I  still  couldn’t  do  it.  I  just  splashed  along  
with one foot hopping on the bot tom.   I’d   lunge   forward   and   crash   beneath   the   waves   before  
spluttering up to the surface trying not to swallow the seawater.  
‘Never  mind,  Ricky,’  Auntie  Joyce  said.  ‘There’s  always  next  year.’  
But I was determined not to wait that long. Auntie Joyce had mad e me a bet, and I doubted that 
she would remember it the next year. On our last day we got up early, packed the cars and set out on 
the twelve -hour journey home. The roads were narrow; the cars were slow; and it was a hot day. 
Everyone wanted to get home. As we drove along I saw a river.  
‘Daddy,  can  you  stop  the  car,  please?’  I  said.  
This  river  was  my  last  chance:  I  was  sure  that  I  could  swim  and  win  Auntie  Joyce’s  ten  shillings.  
‘Please  stop!’  I  shouted.  
Dad looked in the rear -view mirror, slowed down and pulled up on the grass verge.  ‘What’s  the  matter?’  Aunt  Wendy  asked  as  we  all  piled  out  of  the  car.  
‘Ricky’s  seen  the  river  down  there,’  Mum  said.  ‘He  wants  to  have  a  final  go  at  swimming.’  
‘Don’t  we  want  to  get  on  and  get  home?’  Aunt  Wendy  complained.  ‘It ’s  such  a  long  drive.’  
‘Come  on,  Wendy.  Let’s  give  the  lad  a  chance,’  Auntie  Joyce  said.  ‘After  all,  it’s  my  ten  
shillings.’ 
I  pulled  off  my  clothes  and  ran  down  to  the  riverbank  in  my  underpants.  I  didn’t  dare  stop  in   case 
anyone  changed  their  mind.  By  the  time  I  reached  the  water’s  edge  I  was  rather  frightened.  Out  in  the  
middle of the river, the water was flowing fast with a stream of bubbles dancing over the boulders. I 
found a part of the bank that had been trodden down by some cows, and waded out into the current. 
The mud squeezed up between my toes. I looked back. Uncle Joe and Aunt Wendy and Auntie Joyce, 
my parents and sister Lindi stood watching me, the ladies in floral dresses, the men in sports jackets 
and tie s. Dad was lighting his pipe and looking utterly unconcerned; Mum was smiling her usual 
encouragement.  
I braced myself and jumped forward against the current, but I immediately felt myself sinking, 
my legs slicing uselessly through the water. The current p ushed me around, tore at my underpants and 
dragged  me  downstream.  I  couldn’t  breathe  and  I  swallowed  water.  I  tried  to  reach  up  to  the  surface,  
but had nothing to push against. I kicked and writhed around but it was no help.  
Then my foot found a stone and I pushed up hard. I came back above the surface and took a deep 
breath. The breath steadied me, and I relaxed. I had to win that ten shillings.  
I kicked slowly, spread my arms, and found myself swimming across the surface. I was still 
bobbing up and down, but  I  suddenly  felt  released:  I  could  swim.  I  didn’t  care  that  the  river  was  
pulling me downstream. I swam triumphantly out into the middle of the current. Above the roar and 
bubble of the water I heard my family clapping and cheering. As I swam in a lopsi ded circle and came 
back to the riverbank some fifty yards below them, I saw Auntie Joyce fish in her huge black handbag 
for her purse. I crawled up out of the water, brushed through a patch of stinging nettles and ran up the 
bank. I may have been cold, mu ddy and stung by the nettles, but I could swim.  
‘Here  you  are,  Ricky,’  Auntie  Joyce  said.  ‘Well  done.’  
I looked at the ten -shilling note in my hand. It was large, brown and crisp. I had never held that 
amount of money before: it seemed a fortune.  
‘All  right,  everyone,’  Dad  said.  ‘On  we  go.’  
It was then that I realised he too was dripping wet. He had lost his nerve and dived in after me. 
He gave me a massive hug.  
I cannot remember a moment in my life when I have not felt the love of my family. We were a fami ly 
that would have killed for each other – and we still are. My parents adored each other, and in my 
childhood there was barely a cross word between them. Eve, my mother, was always full of life and 
galvanised us. Ted, my father, was a rather quieter figur e who smoked his pipe and enjoyed his newspaper, but both my parents had a love of adventure. Ted had wanted to be an archaeologist, but 
his father, a High Court judge, wanted him to follow Branson tradition and enter the law. Three 
generations of Bransons  had been lawyers. When Ted was at school, my grandfather engaged a 
careers officer to talk to him and discuss possible careers. When it emerged that Ted wanted to be an 
archaeologist,  my  grandfather  refused  to  pay  the  careers  officer’s  bill  on  the  grounds  that  he  hadn’t  
done his job properly. So Ted reluctantly went up to Cambridge to read law, and continued as a hobby 
to  build  up  his  collection  of  ancient  artefacts  and  fossils  which  he  called  his  ‘museum’.  
When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Ted volunteered for the Staffordshire 
Yeomanry, a cavalry regiment organised around the Inns of Court. His regiment fought in Palestine 
and Ted fought in the Battle of El Alamein in September 1942, and subsequent battles in the Libyan 
desert. He was then invol ved in the invasion of Italy and fought at Salerno and Anzio. Before Ted 
went to war, he devised a code to let my grandparents know where he was: they agreed that, in letters 
home, the cellar would be the world and certain drawers in the cupboards would re present certain 
countries. Ted would write and ask his mother to pull out his old riding gloves from the top left -hand 
shelf of the right -hand cupboard, which had been designated Palestine – unsurprisingly, the censors 
never picked this up and my grandpare nts could tell where he was.  
When Ted joined up, his uncle, Jim Branson, had already become quite notorious in the army 
because he advocated eating grass. Great -uncle Jim had owned an estate in Hampshire which he had 
finally split up among the tenants and then gone to live in Balham, which in 1939 was a distant suburb 
of London. He was obsessed with eating grass, and Picture Post  ran a story with a picture of him in 
his bathroom in Balham, where he grew tubs of grass which he made into hay. Whenever Jim was  
invited out to eat – which was increasingly often as he became a celebrity – he brought his nosebag 
with  him  and  ate  grass.  In  the  army,  everyone  mocked  my  dad:  ‘You  must  be  Jim  Branson’s  son!  
Here,  have  some  grass!  You’re  a  sprightly  looking  colt.  When  a re  they  going  to  geld  you?’  and  so  on.  
Ted hotly denied any involvement with Uncle Jim. However, as the war progressed, David 
Stirling set up the Special Air Service, a crack regiment designed to operate behind enemy lines. The 
SAS had to travel light, and  soon it became known that Jim Branson was advising David Stirling and 
his elite troops on how to live off grass and nuts.  
From  then  on,  whenever  Ted  was  asked,  ‘Branson?  Are  you  anything  to  do  with  Jim  Branson?’  
he  puffed  out  his  chest  with  pride:  ‘Yes,  a ctually  he’s  my  uncle.  Fascinating  what  he’s  doing  with  the  
SAS,  isn’t  it?’  
Ted actually enjoyed the five years away from home, and found it quite difficult to knuckle down 
to the law again when he returned to Cambridge. A few years later, as a young barri ster, he arrived 
rather late at a cocktail party where he was greeted by a beautiful blonde girl called Eve who swooped 
across  the  room  towards  him,  picked  up  a  tray  of  honeyed  sausages,  and  said,  ‘The  way  to  a  man’s  
heart is through his stomach. Here, hav e  some  of  these!’  
Eve Huntley -Flindt had picked up some of her dazzling energy from her mother Dorothy, who 
holds two British records: aged 89 Granny became the oldest person in Britain to pass the advanced 
Latin -American ballroom -dancing examination, and aged 90 she became the oldest person to hit a 
hole in one at golf.  Granny was 99 when she died. Shortly before that, she had written to me to say that the previous 
ten years had been the best of her life. That same year, on her way round the world on a cru ise ship, 
she had been left behind in Jamaica with only her swimming costume on. She had even read A Brief 
History of Time  (something  which  I’ve  never  been  able  to  manage!).  She  never  stopped  learning.  Her  
attitude  was,  you’ve  got  one  go  in  life,  so  make  t he most of it.  
Mum  had  inherited  Granny’s  love  of  sports  and  dancing,  and  aged  twelve  she  appeared  in  a  West  
End  revue  written  by  Marie  Stopes,  who  later  became  famous  for  her  work  with  women’s  health  
education. Some time later Mum was almost obliged to st rip for another stage job: dancing for The 
Cochran Show  at  Her  Majesty’s  Theatre  in  the  West  End.  Sir  Charles  Cochran’s  shows  were  notorious  
for having the most gorgeous girls in town, and they took their clothes off. It was wartime and work 
was scarce. Ev e decided to take the job on the grounds that it was all a lot of harmless fun. 
Predictably,  my   grandfather  violently  objected  and  told  her  that  he’d   come  storming  up  to   Her  
Majesty’s  and  pull  her  out  of  the  show.  Eve  relayed  this  to  Sir  Charles  Cochran,  w ho allowed her to 
dance without stripping. Then, as now, she was able to get away with pretty much anything.  
Eve started looking for other, daytime, work, and went out to Heston where a gliding club taught 
RAF recruits to glide before they became pilots. S he asked for a job as a pilot, but was told that these 
jobs were available only to men. Undeterred, she chatted up one of the instructors, who relented and 
secretly gave her the job so long as she pretended to be a boy. So, wearing a leather jacket, a leat her 
helmet to hide her hair, and adopting a deep voice, Eve learnt how to glide and then began to teach the 
new pilots. In the last year of the war she joined the Wrens as a signaller and was posted to the Black 
Isle in Scotland.  
After the war Eve became a n air hostess, at the time a most glamorous job. The qualifications 
were challenging: you had to be very pretty and unmarried, aged between 23 and 27, speak Spanish, 
and  be  trained  as  a  nurse.  Undaunted  that  she  couldn’t  speak  Spanish  and  wasn’t  a  nurse,  M um chatted 
up the night porter at the recruitment centre and found herself on the training course to be a hostess 
with British South American Airways, BSAA. BSAA operated two kinds of plane between London 
and South America: Lancasters, which carried 13 pas sengers; and Yorks, which carried 21. They had 
wonderful names, Star Stream  and Star Dale , and the air hostesses were known as Star Girls. When 
the  plane  taxied  down  the  runway,  Mum’s  first  job  was  to  offer  round  chewing  gum,  barley  sugar,  
cotton wool and Penguin paperbacks, and explain to the passengers that they had to blow their noses 
before taking off and landing.  
The cabins were not pressurised, and the flights were marathons: five hours to Lisbon, eight 
hours to Dakar, and then fourteen hours across to Buenos Aires. For the Buenos Aires to Santiago leg 
the York aircraft was exchanged for the more robust Lancaster,  and everyone had to wear oxygen 
masks over the Andes. After she had been with BSAA for a year, it was taken over by BOAC, British 
Overseas Airways Corporation, and Eve began working on Tudor aircraft. Star Tiger , the first plane to 
leave for Bermuda, expl oded in midair. Her plane was next and arrived safely. But the plane after 
hers, Star Ariel , vanished without trace in the Bermuda Triangle and all Tudor aircraft were grounded. 
It was later discovered that their fuselages were too weak to withstand the re cently installed 
pressurisation.  
By  this  time  Ted  probably  thought  that,  if  he  didn’t  marry  Eve  and  so  disqualify  her  from  being  
an air hostess, she would be likely to disappear somewhere over the Atlantic. He proposed to her as they roared along on his mo torbike,  and  she  shouted,  ‘Yes!’  at  the  top  of  her  voice  so  that  the  wind  
wouldn’t  blow  the  word  away.  They  were  married  on  14  October  1949,  and  I  was  conceived  on  their  
honeymoon in Majorca.  
My parents always treated my two sisters, Lindi and Vanessa, and  me as equals whose opinions were 
just  as  valid  as  theirs.  When  we  were  young,  before  Vanessa’s  arrival,  if  my  parents  went  out  to  dinner  
they took me and Lindi with them lying on blankets in the back of the car. We slept in the car while 
they had dinner, but we always woke up when they started the drive back home. Lindi and I kept quiet 
and looked up at the night sky, listening to my parents talk and joke about their evening. We grew up 
talking  as  friends  to  our  parents.  As  children  we  discussed  Dad’s  lega l cases, and argued about 
pornography and whether drugs should be legalised long before any of us knew what we were really 
talking about. My parents always encouraged us to have our own opinions and rarely gave us advice 
unless we asked for it.  
We lived in  a village called Shamley Green in Surrey. Before Vanessa was born, Lindi and I 
grew up in Easteds, a cottage covered with ivy which had tiny white windows and a white wicket gate 
which led out on to the village green. I was three years older than Lindi, a nd nine years older than 
Vanessa.  My  parents  had  very  little  money  during  our  childhood  and,  perhaps  because  Mum  wasn’t  
greatly interested in cooking, or perhaps because she was saving money, I remember eating a good 
deal of bread and dripping. Even so, tr aditions were still upheld and we were not allowed to leave the 
table until we had finished all our food. We were also given onions which grew in the garden. I always 
hated them and used to hide them in a drawer in the table. This drawer was never cleaned out, and 
when we moved house ten years later it was opened and my pile of fossilised onions was discovered.  
Food was not as important at meals as company. The house was always full of people. In order to 
make ends meet, Mum invited German and French studen ts over to learn English in a typical English 
household, and we had to entertain them. Mum always had us working in the garden, helping her 
prepare meals and then clearing up afterward. When I wanted to escape, I ran off across the village 
green to see my best friend Nik Powell.  
At first the best thing about Nik was that his mother made amazing custard, so after a meal spent 
stuffing  onions  into  the  table  drawer  I  would  slip  away  to  Nik’s  house,  leaving  the  Germans  trying  to  
speak English with my family lau ghing and helping them out. If I timed it right, which I made sure I 
did, pudding and custard were already on the table. Nik was a quiet boy with straight black hair and 
black eyes. Soon we started doing everything together: climbing trees, riding bikes, s hooting rabbits 
and  hiding  under  Lindi’s  bed  to  grab  her  ankle  when  she  turned  out  the  light.  
At home Mum had two obsessions: she always generated work for us, and she was always 
thinking  of  ways  to  make  money.  We  never  had  a  television  and  I  don’t  think  m y parents ever listened 
to the radio. Mum worked in a shed in the garden, making wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins 
which she sold to shops. Her shed smelt of paints and glue and was stacked with little piles of painted 
boxes ready to be sent off. Dad  was inventive and very good with his hands, and he designed special 
pressing vices which held the boxes together while they were being glued. Eventually Mum began 
supplying Harrods with her tissue boxes, and it became a proper little cottage industry. As with 
everything she did, Mum worked in a whirlwind of energy which was difficult to resist.  There  was  a  great  sense  of  teamwork  within  our  family.  Whenever  we  were  within  Mum’s  orbit  
we had to be busy. If we tried to escape by saying that we had something else to do, we were firmly 
told we were selfish. As a result we grew up with a clear priority of putting other people first. Once a 
boy  came  for  the  weekend  whom  I  didn’t  particularly  take  to.  During  the  church  service  on  Sunday  I  
slipped out of our pew an d went across the aisle to sit with Nik. Mum was furious. When we got home 
she told Dad to beat me, and we duly went into his study and closed the door. Rather than towering 
over me in a rage, Dad just smiled.  
‘Now  make  sure  you  cry  convincingly,’  he  said,  and clapped his hands together six times to make 
great smacking noises.  
I ran out of the room, bawling loudly. Mum adopted a severe look to imply that this was in my 
best interests, and resolutely carried on chopping onions in the kitchen – my portion of which was 
duly stuffed into the table drawer during lunch.  
Great -uncle  Jim  wasn’t  the  only  maverick  in  the  family:  irreverence  for  authority  ran  on  both  sides.  I  
remember that we acquired an old gypsy caravan which we kept in the garden, and sometimes gypsies 
came by and rang the doorbell. Mum always gave them something silver and let them rummage 
around in the barn for anything they needed. One year we were all taken to the Surrey County Show at 
Guildford. It was thronging with gleaming show -jumpers and men in tweed coats and bowler hats. As 
we walked past one of the stalls Mum saw a group of gypsy children in tears and we went over to see 
what was the matter. They were all crowded around a magpie which was tied to a piece of string.  
‘The  RSPC A  has  ordered  us  to  bring  the  bird  in  to  be  put  down.  They  say  it’s  illegal  to  own  wild  
birds,’  they  said.  
Even as they told us what was happening, we saw an RSPCA official walking towards us.  
‘Don’t  worry,’  Mum  said.  ‘I’ll  save  it.’  
She picked up the bird  and wrapped it in her coat. Then we smuggled it out of the showground 
past the officials. The gypsy children met us outside and they told us to keep the magpie since they 
would only be stopped again. Mum was delighted, and we drove it home.  
The magpie lov ed Mum. It sat on her shoulder when she was in the kitchen or working in her 
shed, and would then swoop out to the paddock and tease the ponies by sitting on their backs. It dive -
bombed Dad if he sat down to read The Times  after lunch, flapping the pages s o that they scattered 
over the floor.  
‘Damned  bird!’  Dad  would  roar,  waving  his  arms  at  it  to  shoo  it  away.  
‘Ted,  get  up  and  do  something  useful,’  Mum  said.  ‘That  bird’s  telling  you  to  do  some  gardening.  
And, Ricky and Lindi, run along to the vicar and ask  him  if  there’s  anything  you  can  do  to  help.’  
Apart  from  spending  summer  holidays  with  Dad’s  family  at  Salcombe  in  Devon,  we  also  went  to  
Norfolk  to  stay  with  Mum’s  sister,  Clare  Hoare.  I  decided  that  when  I  grew  up  I  wanted  to  be  like  
Aunt Clare. She was a close friend of Douglas Bader, the Second World War fighter ace who had lost 
both his legs in a plane crash. Aunt Clare and Douglas owned an old biplane which they flew together. Sometimes Aunt Clare would parachute out of the plane for fun. She smoked a bout twenty small 
cigars a day.  
When we stayed with her, we swam in the millpond at the bottom of her garden. Douglas Bader 
would unstrap his legs and haul himself into the water. I used to run off with these tin legs and hide 
them in the rushes by the wat er’s  edge.  Douglas  would  then  pull  himself  out  of  the  water  and  come  
lunging after me: his arms and shoulders were immensely powerful and he could walk on his hands. 
When he had been held a prisoner of war in Colditz, after two failed escapes the Nazis had  confiscated 
his legs.  
‘You’re  as  bad  as  the  Nazis,’  he’d  roar,  swinging  himself  after  me  on  his  hands  like  an  orang -
utan. 
Aunt Clare was as much of an entrepreneur as Mum. She was obsessed with Welsh Mountain 
sheep, which were then an endangered species, and she bought a few of these black sheep in order to 
save them from extinction. She eventually bred up a large flock and managed to bring them off the 
endangered list. She then set up a business which she called The Black Sheep Marketing Company 
and start ed selling pottery decorated with pictures of black sheep. The mugs with the nursery rhyme 
‘Baa  Baa  Black  Sheep’  written  round  the  side  began  to  sell  rather  well.  Soon  Aunt  Clare  had  all  the  
old ladies in the village knitting her black wool into shawls and  sweaters. She worked very hard to 
build  up  Black  Sheep  as  a  trade  name,  and  she  succeeded:  over  forty  years  later  it’s  still  going  strong.  
Some  years  later,  in  the  early  days  of  Virgin  Music,  I  received  a  call  from  Aunt  Clare:  ‘Ricky,  
you  won’t  believe  th is.  One  of  my  sheep  has  started  singing.’  
Initially my mind reeled, but it was the sort of thing I had come to expect from her.  
‘What  does  it  sing?’  I  asked,  imagining  a  sheep  singing,  ‘Come  on,  baby,  light  my  fire.’  
‘“Baa  Baa  Black  Sheep”  of  course,’  she   snapped  at  me.  ‘Now  I  want  to  make  a  recording.  The  
sheep  probably  won’t  do  it  in  a  studio  so  can  you  send  some  sound  engineers  out  here?  And  they’d  
better  hurry  since  it  could  stop  at  any  time.’  
That afternoon a bunch of sound engineers headed up to Norfo lk with a 24 -track mobile studio 
and  recorded  Aunt  Clare’s  singing  sheep.  They  also  amassed  an  entire  choir  of  sheep,  ducks  and  hens  
for  the  chorus,  and  we  released  the  single  ‘Baa  Baa  Black  Sheep’.  It  reached  number  four  in  the  
charts.  
My friendship with Nik was based on affection but also on a strong element of competition. I was 
determined to do everything better than he did. One summer Nik was given a brand -new bike for his 
birthday. We immediately decided to take it down to do the River Run, a game in which you raced 
straight downhill, braked at the last moment and skidded to a halt as close to the edge of the riverbank 
as possible. This was a highly competitive game and I hated losing.  
Since it was his bike, Nik went first. He did a very creditable ski d, curving round so that the back 
wheel  came  to  within  a  foot  of  the  water’s  edge.  Nik  generally  tried  to  spur  me  on  to  do  even  more  
outlandish things, but this time he tried to stop me.  ‘You  can’t  do  better  than  that  skid,’  he  said.  ‘Mine  was  perfect.’  
I thought otherwise. I was determined to do a better skid than Nik. I took his bike up the hill and 
launched myself towards the river, pedalling madly. As I approached the bank it became apparent that 
I was out of control and had no chance of stopping. In a fast-moving  blur  I  caught  sight  of  Nik’s  open  
mouth and horrified expression as I hurtled past him. I tried to brake, but it was too late. I 
somersaulted head over heels into the water, and the bike sank beneath me. I was swept downstream 
by the current, b ut finally managed to clamber back ashore. Nik was waiting for me, enraged.  
‘You’ve  lost  my  bike!  That’s  my  birthday  present!’  
He was so furious that he was sobbing with rage. He pushed me back in the water.  
‘You’d  damn  well  better  find  it,’  he  shouted.  
‘I’ll  find  it,’  I  spluttered.  ‘It’ll  be  OK.  I’ll  fish  it  out.’  
‘You  bloody  well  better  had.’  
I spent the next two hours diving down to the bottom of the river and groping around the mud 
and  weeds  and  stones  trying  to  find  his  new  bike.  I  couldn’t  find  it  any where. Nik sat on the bank, 
hugging  his  knees  up  to  his  chin,  glaring  at  me.  Nik  was  epileptic,  and  I’d  been  with  him  on  a  couple  
of  occasions  in  the  past  when  he’d  experienced  fits.  Now  he  was  furious,  and  I  hoped  his  anger  would  
not spur another one. But  eventually, when I was so cold that I could barely talk and my hands were 
white, numb and bleeding from bashing into rocks on the riverbed, Nik relented.  
‘Let’s  go  home,’  he  said.  ‘You’ll  never  find  it.’  
We  walked  back  home  and  I  tried  to  cheer  him  up:  ‘We’ll  buy  you  another  one,’  I  promised  him.  
My  parents  must  have  groaned  because  the  bike  cost  over  £20,  nearly  a  month’s  supply  of  tissue  
boxes.  
When we were eight years old, Nik and I were separated when I was sent away to board at 
Scaitcliffe Preparatory School in Windsor Great Park.  
On my first night at Scaitcliffe, I lay awake in my bed, listening to the snorings and snufflings of the 
other boys in the dormitory, feeling utterly lonely, unhappy and frig htened. At some point in the 
middle  of  that  first  night,  I  knew  I  was  going  to  be  sick.  The  feeling  came  on  so  fast  that  I  didn’t  have  
time to get out of bed and run to the bathroom; instead I vomited all over the bedclothes. The matron 
was called. Instead  of being sympathetic, as my mother would have been, she scolded me and made 
me clear it up myself. I can still remember the humiliation I felt. Obviously, my parents thought they 
were doing the right thing in sending me there, but at that moment I could f eel only confusion and 
resentment towards them, and a terrible fear of what lay in store for me. Within a couple of days, an 
older  boy  in  my  dormitory  had  taken  a  liking  to  me  and  got  me  into  his  bed  to  play  ‘feelies’.  On  my  
first weekend home I matter of factly told my parents what had happened under the sheets. My dad 
calmly  said,  ‘It’s  best  not  to  do  that  sort  of  thing,’  and  that  was  the  first  and  last  time  such  an  incident  
happened.  My father had been sent to boarding school at the same age, and his fat her before him. It was the 
traditional way for a boy from my background to be educated, to cultivate independence, self -reliance 
– to teach someone to stand on their own two feet. But I loathed being sent away from home at such 
an early age, and have alway s vowed to myself that I would never send my children to boarding 
school until they were of an age to make up their own minds about it.  
In  my  third  week  at  Scaitcliffe  I  was  summoned  to  the  headmaster’s  study  and  told  that  I  had  
broken some rule; I think I  had walked on to a patch of hallowed grass to retrieve a football. I had to 
bend down and I was caned across my bottom six times.  
‘Branson,’  the  headmaster  intoned.  ‘Say,  “Thank  you,  sir.”’  
I  couldn’t  believe  my  ears.  Thank  him  for  what?  
‘Branson.’  The  headmaster  lifted  up  his  cane.  ‘I’m  warning  you.’  
‘Thank  you  …  sir.’  
‘You’re  going  to  be  trouble,  Branson.’  
‘Yes,  sir.  I  mean,  no,  sir.’  
I was trouble – and  always  in  trouble.  Aged  eight  I  still  couldn’t  read.  In  fact,  I  was  dyslexic  and  
short-sighted.  Despite  sitting  at  the  front  of  the  class,  I  couldn’t  read  the  blackboard.  Only  after  a  
couple of terms did anyone think to have my eyes tested. Even when I could see, the letters and 
numbers   made  no  sense  at   all.  Dyslexia  wasn’t  deemed  a  probl em in those days, or, put more 
accurately, it was only a problem if you were dyslexic yourself. Since nobody had ever heard of 
dyslexia, being unable to read, write or spell just meant to the rest of the class and the teachers that 
you were either stupid o r lazy. And at prep school you were beaten for both. I was soon being beaten 
once or twice a week for doing poor classwork or confusing the date of the Battle of Hastings.  
My dyslexia was a problem throughout my school life. Now, although my spelling is st ill 
sometimes poor, I have managed to overcome the worst of my difficulties through training myself to 
concentrate. Perhaps my early problems with dyslexia made me more intuitive: when someone sends 
me a written proposal, rather than dwelling on detailed f acts and figures I find that my imagination 
grasps and expands on what I read.  
However, my saving grace was outside the classroom: I was good at sports. It is difficult to 
overestimate how important sport is at English public schools. If you are good at sp orts, you are a 
school  hero:  the  older  boys  won’t  bully  you  and  the  masters  won’t  mind  you  failing  all  your  exams.  I  
was intensely keen to succeed at sports, possibly because it was my only opportunity to excel. I 
became captain of the football, rugby and cricket teams. Every sports day I won a series of cups for 
sprinting and hurdling. Just before my eleventh birthday, in 1961, I won all the races. I even decided 
to go in for the long jump. I had never done a good long jump before, but this time I decided to just 
have a go. I sprinted down the track, took off from the wooden plank and soared through the air. After 
I landed in the sand the master came up to me and shook me by the hand: it was a new Scaitcliffe 
School  record.  That  summer  day  I  couldn’t  put  a   foot wrong, and my parents and Lindi sat and clapped in the white marquee afterward as I went up to collect every cup. I won the Victor Ludorum. 
Who  cared  if  I  couldn’t  spell?  Not  me.  
The next autumn term I was playing in a football match against another l ocal school. I was 
running rings round the defender and had already scored one goal. I put my hand up and yelled for the 
ball, which was booted upfield and bounced over both of us. I turned and sprinted after it, controlled it 
and was bearing down on the g oal when the defender caught up with me and floored me with a sliding 
tackle. My leg was caught beneath him as he fell across me. I heard a ghastly scream and for a split 
second I thought that he was hurt until I realised that it was me. He rolled off me a nd I saw my knee 
twisted at a horrible angle. My parents had always told us to laugh when we were in pain, so half 
laughing but mainly screaming I was carried off the field to the school matron, who drove me to 
hospital. My agony stopped only after they ga ve me an injection. I had badly torn the cartilage in my 
right knee and they were going to have to operate.  
I was given a general anaesthetic and fell unconscious. I awoke to find myself out in the street. I 
was still in my hospital bed, and a nurse was ho lding a drip above my head, but my bed, together with 
several others, was parked outside. I thought I was dreaming, but the nurse explained that there had 
been a fire in the hospital during my operation and all the patients had been evacuated on to the str eet 
outside.  
I went home for a few days to recover. Lying in bed, I looked at my silver cups on the 
mantelpiece. The doctor told me that I would not play sports again for a very long time.  
‘Don’t  worry,  Ricky,’  my  mother  said  as  she  swept  into  the  room  aft er  the  doctor  had  gone.  ‘Just  
think  of  Douglas  Bader.  He  hasn’t  got  any  legs  at  all.  He’s  playing  golf  and  flying  planes  and  
everything.  You  don’t  want  to  be  lying  there  in  bed  doing  nothing  all  day,  do  you?’  
The worst aspect of this injury was that it imm ediately showed up how bad I was in the 
classroom. I was bottom in every subject and would clearly not pass the Common Entrance exam.  
I was sent to another school, a crammer on the Sussex coast called Cliff View House. It had no 
sports to distract boys fro m the grim and usually hopeless task of preparing for Common Entrance. If 
you  couldn’t  spell,  or  couldn’t  add  up,  or  couldn’t  remember  that  the  area  of  a  circle  is  ‘Pi’  R  squared,  
then the solution was simple: you were beaten until you did. I learnt my fac ts in the face of 
unflinching discipline and with a black and blue backside. I may have been dyslexic, but I had no 
excuse.  I  just  couldn’t  get  it  right.  When  I  gave  the  inevitable  wrong  answer  it  was  either  more  lines  or  
a beating. I grew almost to prefer  the beatings since at least they were quick.  
There were no games apart from an early -morning run, and, as well as for any faults in class, we 
were also beaten for almost anything else, such as not making our beds properly, running when we 
should be walkin g, talking when we should be quiet, or having dirty shoes. There were so many 
possible things to do wrong that, although we learnt most of them, we accepted that we would be 
beaten for some obscure misdemeanour almost every single week.  
My only consolation  was  the  headmaster’s  eighteen -year-old daughter, Charlotte. She seemed to 
take a fancy to me and I was delighted that I, out of all the boys, should have caught her attention. We 
soon established a routine of nocturnal visits. Every night I would climb ou t of my dormitory window and  creep  over  to  her  bedroom  in  the  headmaster’s  house.  One  night,  as  I  climbed  back  through  the  
window, I was horrified to see one of my teachers watching my progress.  
The  next  morning  I  was  summoned  to  the  headmaster’s  study.  
‘What  were  you  doing,  Branson?’  he  asked.  
The  only  answer  I  could  think  of  was  the  worst  one  I  could  possibly  have  given:  ‘I  was  on  my  
way  back  from  your  daughter’s  room,  sir.’  
Not surprisingly, I was promptly expelled and my parents were told to come and co llect me the 
following day.  
That evening, unable to think of any other way to escape the wrath of my parents, I wrote a 
suicide note saying that I was unable to cope with the shame of my expulsion. I wrote on the envelope 
that it was not to be opened until  the following day but then gave it to a boy who I knew was far too 
nosy not to open it immediately.  
Very, very slowly, I left the building and walked through the school grounds towards the cliffs. 
When I saw a crowd of teachers and boys beginning to run a fter me, I slowed down enough for them 
to catch me up. They managed to drag me back from the cliff and the expulsion was overturned.  
My parents were surprisingly relaxed about the whole episode. My father even seemed quite 
impressed  that  Charlotte  was  ‘a  very  pretty  girl’.

1963 –1967  
AFTER THE CRAMMER HAD  served its purpose by bea ting me into shape, I moved to Stowe, a big 
public school in Buckinghamshire for over 800 boys. There I faced a daunting prospect. Fagging was 
still in place: this was an archaic practice in which the younger boys were expected to run errands and 
do minor chores for the older ones; in effect, to be their servants. Bullying was rife. Your reputation – 
and ability to avoid being picked on – was helped enormously by being able to score a goal or hit a 
six.  But  I  couldn’t  play  any  games  as  my  knee  buckled  whene ver I tried to run. Since I was also 
unable to cope with the academic work, I was very quickly sidelined. Being out of the sports teams 
and bottom of the class was an unenviable position. It seemed as if all the challenges my parents had 
set me were now ir relevant.  
I found refuge in the library, where I went every afternoon and started writing a novel. I sat in the 
most wonderful splendour, surrounded by leather -bound books and two globes, overlooking the 
ornamental lake into which the last head boy had div ed and never surfaced. I wrote the most lurid 
sexual  fantasies  I  could  conjure  up,  amazing  erotic  stories  all  about  a  young  boy  who  couldn’t  play  
sports due to a knee injury, but who was befriended and then gloriously and expertly seduced by the 
young Scan dinavian  school  matron.  In  my  mind’s  eye  she  used  to  creep  up  behind  him  when  he  was  
working  in  the  library  …  But,  sadly  for  me,  no  matter  what  incredible  sexual  encounters  I  dreamt  up,  
there  wasn’t  a  girl,  let  alone  a  Scandinavian,  within  miles  of  Stowe,   and matron was sixty years old.  
As I sat in the library panting at my own prose and scribbling faster and faster, I became aware of 
another regular visitor to the library: Jonathan Holland -Gems. In comparison with most of the boys at 
Stowe, Jonny was extre mely worldly and sophisticated, widely read and staggeringly knowledgeable 
about the arts. He came from London, where his parents knew journalists and writers: when Jonny 
read Private Eye  he knew half the people mentioned in it. His mother was a successful  playwright. It 
was through Jonny that my interest in the world of newspapers began to grow, and I began to think 
that I would like to be a journalist.  
Halfway through the term I read a school announcement about an essay competition called the 
Junior Gavin  Maxwell Prize which had been set up by the author, an old boy from Stowe. I 
momentarily put aside my pulsating pornography and wrote a short story which won the prize. The 
complete absence of competition must have helped.  
Gavin Maxwell, the author of Ring  of Bright Water , came to present the prize at Stowe. He 
arrived with Gavin Young, the Observer ’s  war  correspondent  and  later  the  author  of   Slow Boat to 
China . After the ceremony they drove back to Surrey and dropped me off at Shamley Green. I stayed 
in to uch with them. They were very supportive of me, partly, I think, because they fancied me. But 
once  they  realised  I  wasn’t  that  way  inclined  they  still  remained  good  and  helpful  friends.  After  
winning the prize, my English began to improve and I soared up t he class to third out of twenty -one. I 
was  still  eighteenth  in  Latin,  and  bottom  in  maths,  physics  and  chemistry.  ‘He  tries  hard  but  has  very  
great difficulty in understanding even the simplest mathematical process and in retaining any new 
topic  covered,’   read one end -of-term report.  One  Easter  holiday,  I  decided  to  follow  my  mother’s  example  and  make  some  money.  Undeterred  
by  the  school’s  lack  of  faith  in  my  ability  with  numbers,  I  saw  an  opportunity  to  grow  Christmas  trees.  
We had just moved house from on e side of Shamley Green to the other, from Easteds Cottage to 
Tanyards Farm, which was a rambling building with many barns and sheds and some land. I went 
round to talk Nik into the plan. He was also on holiday from his school, which was at Ampleforth in 
Yorkshire. We would plant 400 Christmas trees in the field at Tanyards Farm. By the Christmas after 
next, they would have grown to at least four feet and we would be able to sell them. Nik and I agreed 
to do the work together, and share the profits equally.  
That Easter we furrowed the ground and planted the 400 seedlings in the field above Tanyards 
Farm. We worked out that, if they all grew to six feet, we would make £2 a tree, creating a grand total 
of £800, compared with our initial investment of just £5 f or the seedlings. In the following summer 
holiday, we went to investigate the trees. There were one or two tiny sprigs above ground, but the rest 
had been eaten by rabbits. We exacted dire revenge and shot and skinned a lot of rabbits. We sold 
them to the local  butcher  for  a  shilling  each,  but  it  wasn’t  quite  the  £800  we  had  planned.  
The  following  Christmas  Nik’s  brother  was  given  a  budgerigar  as  a  present.  This  gave  me  the  
idea for another great business opportunity: breeding budgies! For a start, I reason ed, I could sell them 
all year round rather than just during the fortnight before Christmas. I worked out the prices and made 
some calculations about how fast they could breed and how cheap their food was, and persuaded my 
father to build a huge aviary. In  my last week at school I wrote to Dad and explained the financial 
implications:  
  
So few days now until the holidays. Have you ordered any material we might want for our giant 
budgerigar cage? I thought our best bet to get the budgerigars at reduced rate would be from 
Julian Carlyon. I feel that if the shops sold them for 30sh., he would get say 17sh. and we could 
buy them off him for 18 or 19sh. which would give him a profit and save us the odd 10sh. per 
bird. How about it?  
My father reluctantly built the  aviary and the birds bred rapidly. However, I had overestimated 
the local demand for budgies. Even after everyone in Shamley Green had bought at least two, we were 
still left with an aviary full of them. One day at school I got a letter from my mother bre aking the bad 
news that the aviary had been invaded by rats which had eaten the budgies. It was only many years 
later that she confessed she had been fed up with cleaning out the aviary so one day had left the cage 
door  open  and  they  all  escaped.  She  didn’ t try too hard to recapture them.  
But, while neither of these schemes had the effect of making money, they did teach me 
something about maths. I found that it was only when I was using real numbers to solve real problems 
that maths made any sense to me. If I was calculating how much a Chri stmas tree would grow, or how 
many budgies would breed, the numbers then became real and I enjoyed using them. Inside the 
classroom I was still a complete dunce at maths. I once did an IQ test in which the questions just 
seemed  absurd.  I  couldn’t  focus  on   any of the mathematical problems, and I think that I scored about 
zero. I worry about all the people who have been classified as stupid by these kinds of tests. Little do 
they know that often these IQ tests have been dreamt up by academics who are absolute ly useless at dealing with the practicalities of the outside world. I loved doing real business plans – even if the 
rabbits did get the better of me.  
I think my parents must have instilled a rebellious streak in me. I have always thought rules were 
there t o be broken, and Stowe had as many rules and regulations as the army – many of them, it 
seemed to Jonny Gems and me, completely anachronistic and pointless. There was the outmoded 
practice of fagging, for one thing. Then there was the CCF (Combined Cadet F orce), in which boys 
dressed up as soldiers and paraded around with antiquated rifles; and compulsory church attendance 
on Sundays. I managed to dodge the latter by skipping the first service of the new term: my name was 
left off the register, and I was ne ver missed from then on.  
During January and February 1966, Jonny and I began to talk about how to change the school 
rules. We were fifteen years old, but we believed that we could make a difference. My parents had 
brought me up to think that we could all c hange the world, so when I looked at how Stowe was run I 
felt sure that I could do it better. Stowe was actually reasonably liberal in encouraging boys of all ages 
to contribute to the running of the school.  
Jonny and I were particularly incensed by the ru le  that  anyone  who  wasn’t  playing  games  had  to  
go and watch the school team when they were playing another school. Although we were able to go to 
the library during weekday afternoons, we were still forced to watch the school teams play most 
Saturdays. I k new  that  if  I  hadn’t  been  ruled  out  by  my  weak  knee  I  would  be  in  the  teams,  so  I  felt  
doubly frustrated. I wrote to the headmaster:  
  
I am against the utter waste of time that is spent in compulsory watching of matches. If one is 
unable to play for the Fi rst  XI  one  should  be  able  to  spend  one’s  time  in  better  ways  than  that.  I  
know this sounds a frightful break against tradition etc., but I feel very strongly about this. If 450 -
odd people watching matches spent that time in Buckingham cleaning windows, for  instance, 
they  would  gain  at  least  something  more  than  ‘watching  others  achieving  something’.  
I also tried to reorganise the system of school meals:  
  
I feel that to improve Stowe one has first got to do it socially, even before religiously. There are 
many boys who are thirsting for knowledge through interesting conversations. One of the best 
times to talk is at meals, but at Stowe this is practically impossible. One goes into hall, sits down 
at  one’s  allotted  table  next  to  the  same  boys  every  day.  A  cante en must be constructed in one of 
the dining rooms. Then boys could choose their own food; they would be free to sit down where 
they wish; and they could put their forks and plates in a box when they go out. The food waste at 
the moment is fantastic, and wi th a canteen system you could cut down on at least half the Italian 
and Spanish waiters.  
I would be very interested in your views on this, and any money saved could possibly be put 
towards  my  next  plan  …  And I went on to explore the idea of a sixth -form ba r. 
The headmaster suggested that I air my views in the school magazine, but Jonny and I wanted to 
set up an alternative magazine with a fresh attitude. We wanted to campaign against fagging, corporal 
punishment, and compulsory chapel, games and Latin. All these  ideas  were  far  too  ‘revolutionary’  to  
be aired in the school magazine, The Stoic , a name which seemed only too apt to its long -suffering 
readers. We then thought about linking up with other schools that had similar rules. Gradually the idea 
of an int erschool magazine was hatched. We would link up with other schools and swap ideas. I jotted 
down a few titles in a school notebook: Today, 1966, Focus!, Modern Britain , and Interview . Then I 
wrote out what I wanted to publish and did some more sums in whic h, once again, I enjoyed thinking 
about the implications of the maths:  
  
 
  
I wrote out a list of 250 MPs whom I found in Who’s  Who , and a list of possible advertisers 
whom I found by going through the telephone book. I also wrote  to WH Smith asking whether they 
would be prepared to stock the magazine. Thus, with contributors, advertisers, distributors and costs 
all in place – at least on paper – I had written my first business plan.  
The numbers looked too small to work, so Jonny a nd I decided to involve more schools, and 
technical colleges and universities: it would open up the magazine to more people, and encourage 
advertisers. We thought that if we aimed the magazine at university students then sixth -formers would 
buy it; but if we published a magazine for sixth -formers  then  students  wouldn’t  be  interested.  
We settled on the name Student , which seemed a good one since at the time there was a great deal 
of  talk  about  ‘student  power’.  This  was  the  period  of  student  sit -ins, occupati ons and demos at 
universities and polytechnics. It was an exciting time to be young. My mother lent me £4 as a float 
against  the  cost  of  telephone  calls  and  letters,  and  Jonny’s  father  arranged  for  headed  notepaper  with  
STUDENT  – THE  MAGAZINE  FOR  BRITAIN’S  YOUTH  printed across the top with the symbol of 
a rising sun. We set to work writing to all the contributors and possible advertisers.  
Student  was a perfect vehicle: it gave us a new lease of life. There was so much to organise. I 
began to set up an offic e in my study at school and asked the headmaster for a telephone in my room – 
he unsurprisingly refused. As a result I had to make telephone calls from a call box, but I quickly 
discovered a useful trick: if I called up the operator and told her that the m achine had taken my money 
but my call had been disconnected, I was able to get a free call. As well as a free call, I was able to 
avoid  the  telltale  ‘pip   – pip – pip’  as  the  coins  went  in.  Better  still,  the  operator  sounded  like  a  
secretary:  ‘I  have  Mr  Bra nson  for  you.’  
  
 
  
I drew up lists and lists of people to call, and slowly worked my way down them. Most of them 
rejected the idea of paying for advertisin g in an unpublished magazine, but gradually I began to find 
ways of attracting their attention. I would call up National Westminster Bank and tell them that Lloyds 
Bank had just taken out a full -page advertisement; would they like to advertise alongside Ll oyds 
Bank? Student  would  be  Britain’s  biggest  magazine  for  young  people,  I  added.  I  called  up  Coca -Cola 
and told them that Pepsi had just booked a big advertisement but that the back page was still free. I 
called up the Daily Telegraph  and asked them wheth er they would prefer to advertise before or after 
the Daily Express .  Another  tack  was  to  ask  an  innocuous  question  that  they  couldn’t  easily  deny:  ‘Are  
you interested in recruiting the highest -calibre school -leavers  and  university  graduates?’  No  personnel  
manager  would  ever  admit  that  they  were  looking  for  mediocre  recruits.  ‘Then  we’re  publishing  just  
the  magazine  for  you  …’  
In order to avoid the operator coming back on the line to cut me off, I learnt how to pack all this 
into five minutes. I started spea king faster and pushing harder. My voice had broken early, and 
nobody guessed that they were talking to a fifteen -year-old schoolboy standing in a public telephone 
box. I gave my address at Shamley Green, and when I sent out letters I wrote them by the doz en and 
posted them to my parents, who in turn asked Elizabeth, an old friend in the village, to type them.  
My schoolwork was going from bad to worse, but I was giving myself a wonderful lesson in 
confidence -building. Had I been five or six years older, the  sheer absurdity of trying to sell advertising 
to major companies, in a magazine that did not yet exist, edited by two fifteen -year-old schoolboys, 
would have prevented me from picking up the phone at all. But I was too young to contemplate 
failure.  
During  the holidays I told Nik all about Student . He was equally excited and agreed to help 
distribute it in Ampleforth. He would also try to find contributors for it. Nik recognised that Student  
was  really  my  and  Jonny’s  creation,  so  he  stood  back  a  little  bit,  but he was as enthusiastic as we were 
about its potential. We were fifteen years old and felt we could do anything.  
By April 1966 and the run -up to O levels, I was able to drop a number of subjects that I had no 
chance of passing and put even more time in to Student . To my relief and that of my Latin and science 
teachers  we  went  our  separate  ways:  ‘He  is  a  very  weak  candidate  indeed  at  Latin  and  he  has  now  
given  it  up’  and  ‘His  interest  in  science  was  obviously  minimal.  Although  I  am  far  from  convinced  
that he could not have done better than he did, it was quite evident that he was never going to make 
much  progress.’  I  was  doing  better  at  history,  French  and  English,  but  not  at  maths,  which  was  
compulsory:  ‘In  spite  of  much  apparent  effort  he  is  finding  diff iculty in retaining methods of attack on 
problems  from  one  week  to  the  next.  He  will  need  a  lot  of  luck  with  the  questions  in  July.’  
However, the main excitement in my life was writing the hundreds of letters which I started 
sending out from Stowe, and wai ting on tenterhooks for the answers. For all my enthusiasm and new -
found guile, it took a long time to find any advertisers willing to commit themselves to taking space in 
Student . Jonny and I sent letters out all summer term, continued in the holidays and  through the 
following autumn term. By April 1967, with my single ancient -history A level looming in the summer 
(I was to take it after only one year in the sixth form), we were still no nearer pulling a magazine 
together. Jonny and I had been working on Student  for over a year, and all we had to show for it were 
dozens of letters of support from various headmasters and teachers, and various vague promises to 
contribute from politicians, but no advertisements or hard copy. I refused to bow to the inevitable . My 
letter home dated 27 April 1967 apologised for the small amount of time I had spent with my family 
over Easter:    
It was a wonderful holiday these last four weeks and more was achieved than ever before. I only 
hope you do not feel too annoyed with me for not being home longer and for not making the time 
to do more in the garden. I, possibly wrongly, see a divided duty: one to my home, and one to 
Student . It is a difficult decision. Anything I do in life I want to do well and not half -heartedly. I 
feel I am doing my best in Student  – as well as the time allows. Yet that leaves little time for my 
other duty. To me I saw a danger of falling between two stools and still do. Of being a failure in 
everything I had and having to search for priorities if I am t o get anywhere. I am also still only 
sixteen.  Although  it  sounds  a  terribly  ‘I’  thing  to  say,  and  I  only  say  it  in  defence,  what  do  most  
sixteen -year-olds do? No one I know here did anything more last holidays than I used to do two 
or three years ago, flic ks in the evening, mucking about during the day. What did you do when 
you were a boy of sixteen? Shoot, fish, swim, go out with girls on one side and possibly your 
museum and helping around the garden on the other side. You had time to help around the 
garden. You did not see the world as it is today when you were sixteen. Your career was almost 
lined up. Today it is one long struggle.  
You say Student  is selfish and self -centred  of  me.  ‘Possibly,’  I  say.  But  is  it  any  more  selfish  
than anything else one does  in life? It is, in my opinion, a career like anything else. It could 
benefit many many more people than going to the films etc. It is a beginning to my life like 
university or your finals were to yours. It might sound really foul of me bringing this up in  my 
first  letter,  but  I’ve  had  little  else  on  my  mind  over  the  last  two  weeks  and  felt  it  made  sense  to  
get it down on paper.  
I was lucky. I always felt that I could speak to my parents as if they were my closest friends. 
Rather than closing down on me, th ey reacted very well to this letter and we kept open our lines of 
communication. At about this time I noticed that a good many of my friends stopped confiding in their 
parents, but I never felt embarrassed or rebellious towards mine. They always encouraged  me to go 
ahead and do whatever I wanted to do, and if they did not always praise my projects they never 
expressed less than sympathy and support. The last thing my father wanted to do was to spend his 
weekends building a cage for my budgerigars, but he ne ver told me. My mother was extremely keen to 
help me with Student , and wrote articles, gave me pocket money that she could scarcely spare and 
thought of people whom I should approach. Once when I told her that I wanted to get in touch with 
David Frost, she  spent weeks asking all her friends whether they knew anyone who knew anyone who 
knew David Frost.  
Then we had our first breakthroughs: we received our first hard copy, a £250 cheque for an 
advertisement, and Gerald Scarfe agreed to draw a cartoon for us a nd be interviewed. Student  was 
finally  changing  from  a  gleam  in  my  mind’s  eye  to  a  real  magazine.  
* * *  
The other thing that changed from a bright gleam to a reality was sex. I had a number of girlfriends 
during the holidays and came tantalisingly closer and closer to losing my virginity at parties, when the 
lights went out and everyone lay around on cushion s. I finally found a girl who was reputed to go the whole way, and at one party we slipped upstairs 
into a remote bedroom. I was amazed when she let me push up her skirt and take off her knickers. As 
we began to make love, she started to moan and groan. Sh e was clearly having a very erotic time. I 
was pretty pleased by how well I must be performing since she was panting and tossing her head from 
side to side as she fought to control her breathing. I put up a great show and finally came with equally 
impressi ve gusto, roaring and shouting and huffing and puffing. Then I rolled off her. To my 
astonishment she carried on panting, apparently having what I took to be ecstatic multiple orgasms. 
Just as I was beginning to feel a little bemused and somewhat redundant , I finally realised that she was 
panting for a reason.  
‘Asthma!’  she  wheezed  in  breathless  panic.  ‘Inhaler!  Ambulance!’  
Happily  my  first  steady  girlfriend  was  healthy  and  Dutch.  Rudi  was  a  Dutch  ‘revolutionary’,  and  
in my last term I invited her to Stowe: she slipped into the school grounds and secretly pitched her tent 
in the middle of the wood. For one glorious week I cre pt out every night and walked past the lake to 
the woods where Rudi would be smoking pot and cooking over a tin stove. We lay out under the stars 
and talked about what we would do to change the world. Rudi was passionately interested in world 
politics. She  became Student ’s  grandly  titled  ‘Dutch  overseas  correspondent’  and  went  on  to  write  
some powerful pieces about the Baader Meinhof terrorist gang.  
After dropping all subjects except ancient history, I had even more time for Student  magazine. 
Soon Jonny and  I were regularly taking the train to London to interview people. However, I had to 
take my A level, and I was having difficulty remembering facts that struck me as meaningless and 
abstract. I had bought some fact -file cards on ancient history which contai ned all the necessary 
information about Greece and Rome. In preparation for the exam I cut the edges off these and put 
them in various pockets, even sliding one under my watch strap. When I looked at the questions in the 
exam, the most difficult thing was remembering which pocket the relevant facts were in. Then I pulled 
the card out of my pocket and held it curled in the palm of my left hand as I wrote with my right. As it 
happened, I was too preoccupied with Student  to care about what grade I achieved. I was just intent on 
leaving Stowe as quickly as possible and starting life as a journalist in London.  
When  I  left  Stowe  in  1967  aged  almost  seventeen,  my  headmaster’s  parting  words  to  me  were:  
‘Congratulations,  Branson.  I  predict  that  you  will  either  go  to   prison  or  become  a  millionaire.’  
The next and final time I heard from Stowe was six months later in a letter from the headmaster 
dated 16 January 1968:  
Dear Branson,  
I have been pleased to see that the press have given you a good send -off and I was very 
interested to see a copy of your first issue. May I send you congratulations and all good wishes 
for the future.  
Yours,  
R Drayson  
The first issue of Student  was published in January 1968.  3 Virgins at business  
1967 –1970  
AT THE END OF  the summer term, 1967,  Jonny  Gems  and  I  moved  into  the  basement  of  his  parents’  
house in Connaught Square, just off the Edgware Road in London. We managed to persuade Vanessa 
Redgrave to change her mind from merely sending us her best wishes for the success of Student  to 
giving  us an interview. The interview was a turning point for us since we could now use her name as a 
magnet to attract other contributors. As the list of contributors grew to include people like David 
Hockney and Jean -Paul Sartre, it became correspondingly easi er for me to persuade some of the 
possible advertisers that Student  would be a worthwhile place for them to appear.  
Jonny and I lived in the basement all summer. The room was dark, dank, and sparsely furnished. 
We slept on mattresses on the floor. The plac e quickly began to look a complete shambles, scattered 
with papers, dirty coffee cups and fish -and-chip wrappers. We were always hungry. Sometimes we 
would  slip  upstairs  to  raid  Jonny’s  parents’  fridge.  Mum  would  occasionally  burst  in  through  the  door  
carrying a picnic hamper.  
‘Red  Cross  delivery!’  she  would  shout.  ‘When  did  you  two  last  wash?’  
We would spread a counterpane on the floor and pile into her picnic.  
One day she brought us £100 in cash. Mum had found a necklace on the road near Shamley 
Green and  taken it into the police station. When nobody had claimed it after three months, the police 
told her she could have it. She knew we had no money, so she came up to London, sold it and gave us 
the money. Her £100 paid off our telephone and postage bills an d kept us going for months. Without it 
we could have collapsed.  
Peter  Blake,  who  was  famous  for  designing  The  Beatles’   Sergeant Pepper  album cover, drew a 
picture of a student for our first edition. It was a plain white cover with only two splashes of red:  on 
the title, Student , and the red tie the student wore. As well as giving us this illustration, Peter Blake 
also  gave  us  an  interview.  He  began  in  arresting  style:  ‘A  very  pretty  girl  with  no  clothes  on  is  a  
marvellous   subject,   and  one   I’m  particularly  i nterested in. It is one of those things, along with 
perspective  and  anatomy,  which  teaches  you  how  to  draw.’  
While I rapidly considered the advantages of becoming an artist, he went on to point out the 
dangers  of  ‘student  power’   – which struck a controvers ial note at the time:  
  
I  don’t  think  the  students  should  have  any  more  power  over  the  teachers  than  they  have  already.  
Just  at  the  moment  I  don’t  really  like  students  as  a  group  of  people.  I  think  they  rather  overrate  
themselves. They seem to talk a lot a nd protest a lot, and have too many rights. I think one could 
get overinvolved in the activity of being a student. After all, students are not so important – they 
are  really  only  there  to  learn  how  to  be  adults.  Students  shouldn’t  feel  that  they   have  to co mplain.  Perhaps because we were so young and not as aggressive as the usual professional interviewers 
they faced, some of our contributors made very revealing and graphic remarks. Gerald Scarfe 
described  his  work:  ‘I’ll  always  draw   – it’s  a  matter  of  energ y.  I  could  never  stop.  It’s  as  much  a  part  
of me as eating. When I get an idea it has to come out – it  is  like  being  sick,  a  bodily  function.’  When  
I  asked  Dudley  Moore  what  he  thought  of  students  he  answered:  ‘The  only  thing  I  hate  about  your  
generation i s  your  age.’  He  had  been  an  organ  scholar  at  Magdalen  College,  Oxford,  but  when  I  
mentioned  classical  music  he  said:  ‘I’d  much  rather  roll  about  in  the  mud  with  six  women  all  day  than  
sit  down  at  the  piano.’  
Mick Jagger and John Lennon also agreed to be in terviewed. Both were demigods to the student 
population. Student  gave a grandiose introduction to the Jagger interview:  
  
Recently Melody Maker  wrote:  ‘Jagger  is  rather  like  Dostoyevsky’s  brother  Karamazov  who,  
when told by his venerable brother that pain must exist so that we might learn of goodness, 
replied that, if it was necessary that one small child should suffer in order that he should be made 
more aware, he did not deny the existence of God, but merely respectfully returned his ticket of 
admission t o  heaven.  That  is  Mick  Jagger’s  kind  of  rebellion.’  
I  can’t  imagine  what  we  were  thinking  of  when  we  quoted  that.  I  certainly  didn’t  understand  it.  
I nervously went along to his house on Cheyne Walk, and was shown into the living room by 
Marianne Faithfull, who then tantalisingly disappeared upstairs. Mick and I smiled at each other 
genially but were both equally at a loss for words:  
  
RB: Do you like giving interviews?  
MJ: No.  
RB: Why did you ask Student  to interview you?  
MJ:  I  don’t  know.  I’ve  got  no  idea.  I  don’t  usually  give  interviews.  I  mean,  hardly  ever.  
RB:  You’re  not  interested  in  politics?  
MJ: No.  
RB: Why not?  
MJ:  Because  I’ve   kind  of  thought  about  it  for  a  long  time  and  decided  that  I  haven’t  got  time  to  
do that and understand other things. I mean, if you get involved in politics you get really fucked 
up. 
RB: Do you think people can be influenced by music?  MJ: Yeah, I think the y  probably  can  because  it’s  one  of  those  things   – it’s  repetitive,  the  same  
thing over and over again. It gets into your brain and influences you.  
Our  interview  with  John  Lennon  was  another  ‘classic’.  Jonny  and  I  went  along  together,  and  
Jonny tried to mak e a literary allusion:  
  
JG:  A  critic  has  written  about  ‘A  Day  In  The  Life’  as  a  kind  of  miniature   Waste Land . 
JL: Miniature what?  
JG:  TS  Eliot’s  poem,   The Waste Land . 
JL:  I  don’t  know  about  that.  Not  very  hip  on  me  culture,  you  know.  
Ironically, the inter view with John was almost the end of Student . After Jonny and I had met him, 
I had the idea of asking whether John and Yoko would provide the magazine with an original 
recording which we could distribute with Student  as a flexidisc.  
I contacted Derek Taylo r,  The  Beatles’  press  officer.  At  that  time,  The  Beatles  had  just  set  up  the  
Apple Foundation for the Arts, with the idea of funding struggling artists and musicians. Most of 
Derek’s   day   was   spent   sitting   in   his   office   in   Savile   Row,   interviewing   a   long   pr ocession of 
supplicants, all with a hundred different reasons why they thought The Beatles should give them 
money. He was like a lord chamberlain at the court of the king. A sweet man, Derek would listen 
patiently to every request, no matter how far -fetche d or nonsensical.  
When  I  told  him  what  we  wanted  to  do,  Derek  agreed  without  a  moment’s  hesitation.  John  and  
Yoko would be delighted to provide something, he said. He introduced me to Ron Kass, the managing 
director of Apple, and to a manufacturer of flexi discs, and we arranged a delivery date.  
I rushed back to Connaught Square with the good news. Not only did we have a John Lennon 
interview: we would soon have an original, unreleased John Lennon song. It was a fantastic 
promotional coup for Student . We con tacted Alan Aldridge, the most fashionable illustrator of the day, 
and commissioned him to design a special front cover, leaving a white space where the flexidisc 
would be attached. And we made plans to print 100,000 copies of the magazine – our largest ev er print 
run. 
The  weeks  went  by,  and  still  no  record  arrived.  In  mounting  anxiety  I  called  Derek.  ‘Don’t  worry,  
Richard,’  he  said.  ‘We’ve  had  a  few  problems.  But  I  promise  you’ll  get  something.’  In  fact,  I  could  
hardly have chosen a worse time to tax the L ennons’  goodwill.  Yoko  had  just  lost  the  baby  she  was  
expecting; John had been busted for possession of cannabis; and the couple were lying low at their 
mansion in Weybridge.  
I was in trouble myself. Our plans for the special issue had put Student  on the b rink of 
bankruptcy. I was getting desperate. For the first time in my life, I contacted a lawyer, Charles 
Levison, who wrote to Derek, threatening to sue Apple and the Lennons for breach of promise.  A few days later, I received a telephone call from Derek.  ‘Come  round  to  Apple,  Richard,’  he  
said.  ‘We’ve  got  something  for  you.’  
That afternoon I sat in the basement studio at Apple, with Charles, Derek, John and Yoko, 
listening  to  the  recording  they’d  provided.  The  hiss  of  the  tape  recorder  was  followed  by  a  s teady, 
metronomic beat – like the sound of a human heart.  
‘What  is  it?’  I  asked.  
‘It’s  the  heartbeat  of  our  baby,’  said  John.  
No sooner had he spoken than the sound stopped. Yoko burst into floods of tears and hugged 
John.  I  didn’t  understand  what  was  going  on,  but  before  I  could  speak  John  looked  over  Yoko’s  
shoulder straight into my eyes.  
‘The  baby  died,’  he  told  me.  ‘That’s  th e  silence  of  our  dead  baby.’  
I went back to Student  with no idea what I should do. I felt unable to release this private moment 
as  a  record.  Perhaps  I  was  wrong  because,  as  Derek  said,  it  was  ‘conceptual  art’  and  would  have  
become  a  collector’s  piece.  We  h ad to scrap the covers and redesign the magazine. It cost a lot of 
money, but somehow we managed to scrape it together. I considered taking legal action against the 
Lennons,  but  they’d  had  enough  problems  and,  anyway,  they’d  honoured  the  agreement  in  their  own 
particular  way,  even  if  I  couldn’t  see  the  value  of  it  at  the  time.  After  our  dispute  over  the  recording,  
Derek  wrote  a  note  apologising  for  all  the  trouble  I’d  been  caused.  His  sign -off was a phrase he put on 
all  his  correspondence:  ‘All  you  need  is   love  …’ 
Jonny read extensively. I hardly read at all. I never seemed to have the time. I would spend the 
days on the telephone, trying to sell advertising space, persuading people to write for Student  for 
nothing, or to be interviewed. Throughout my life, I’ve  always  needed  somebody  as  a  counterbalance,  
to compensate for my weaknesses, and work off my strengths. Jonny and I were a good team. He 
knew who we should interview, and why. I had the ability to persuade them to say yes, and the 
obstinacy never to a ccept no for an answer.  
In many of the interviews I conducted for Student  I just turned the tape recorder on and let the 
interviewee say whatever they wanted. Before meeting the Scottish psychiatrist RD Laing, I had tried 
to read his bestseller, The Politi cs of Experience . Like most people, I suspect, I had understood hardly 
a word of it. I aimed the microphone at him and he spoke without stopping for an hour and a half, 
staring at a corner of the ceiling behind my head. I had no idea what he was rabbiting on about; I was 
just  grateful  that  there  wasn’t  any  room  for  me  to  ask  him  a  single  question.  At  the  end,  when  it  
became apparent that he had finished, I thanked him profusely, went back to the office and transcribed 
it. It turned out that he had just quot ed pages from The Politics of Experience , almost verbatim.  
After a few issues, the number of people involved with Student  began to grow. Jonny and I would 
sometimes go to nightclubs and chat up girls. Sometimes we could even persuade them to come back 
to the  flat,  ‘for  coffee’.  If  they  stayed  the  night,  the  next  morning  we  would  try  to  persuade  them  to  
help out. For some reason, they often seemed to take pity on us. Word of mouth spread: old friends 
turned up from school; friends of friends, or people who h ad read the magazine, wanted to be involved. Increasingly, the basement resembled a squat. We all worked for no money, living off 
whatever was in the fridge and going out for cheap curries.  
All sorts of people helped to distribute the magazine. The basic i dea was that they would take 
away bundles of magazines and sell them for 2/6d a copy, and then come back and give us half the 
proceeds, 1/3d for each copy sold. They were meant to pay us in advance, but it rarely seemed to work 
like that. But I never reall y worried about how much profit Student  made: I was just determined to 
have enough cash in the kitty to produce the next issue and pay our bills. I thought that, the more 
copies we sold, the more word of mouth would spread and ultimately the more advertising we would 
be able to attract.  
Although  I hardly realised it at the time, my ambition to be a journalist was beginning to be 
pushed to one side by the imperatives of keeping the magazine afloat. Jonny ran the editorial side 
while I ran the business and sold advertising space and argued with the  printers. I was becoming an 
entrepreneur almost by default, although if anybody had mentioned the word to me then I would 
probably  have  had  to  ask  Jonny  what  it  meant.  I  certainly  didn’t  regard  myself  as  a  businessman.  
Businessmen were middle -aged men in the City obsessed with making money. They wore pinstripe 
suits and had wives and 2.4 children in the suburbs. Of course, we wanted to make money on Student  
too – we needed money to survive. But we saw it much more as a creative enterprise than a money -
maki ng one.  
Later, it became apparent to me that business could be a creative enterprise in itself. If you 
publish  a  magazine,  you’re  trying  to  create  something  that  is  original,  that  stands  out  from  the  crowd,  
that will last and, hopefully, serve some useful purpose. Above all, you want to create something you 
are proud of. That has always been my philosophy of business. I can honestly say that I have never 
gone into any business purely to make money. If that is the sole motive then I believe you are better 
off not doing it. A business has to be involving; it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative 
instincts.  
Running Student  was certainly fun. Each day unfolded to the deafening strains of Bob Dylan, The 
Beatles or The Stones blaring out of the hi -fi system, shaking the walls of the basement. When Jonny 
and I went out to sell copies of the magazine, we would celebrate a single sale of the magazine for 
2/6d by going and buying two hamburgers for 1/3d each. Every now and then I would look out of the 
grimy basement window and see that it was a beautiful day. I would turn off the music and tell 
everyone we had to go out for a walk. We would wander across Hyde Park and then somehow 
someone  would  end  up  in  the  Serpentine  and  we’d  all  have  a  swim.  
Tony Mellor  was one of the main assistant editors, and we all respected him because he had been 
a trade -union official. Tony was rather older than the rest of us, and was extremely articulate about 
socialism. As everyone argued over the exact wording of some of the m ore political pronouncements 
in the magazine, I was beginning to be aware of a wider picture: the politics of survival. In some ways 
I  became  an  outsider  on  the  magazine.  While  the  others  would  be  talking  about  the  ‘LSD  guru’  
Timothy Leary, Pink Floyd and the latest convolutions of student politics, I would be worrying about 
paying the printers and telephone bills. As well as spending time on the telephone trying to persuade 
leading figures of the day to write for Student , just for the love of it, I also ha d to spend hours calling 
up companies such as British Leyland or Lloyds Bank, trying to convince them to buy advertising 
space. Without their money, Student  would collapse.  The responsibility made me grow up fast. You might almost say that I was old before  my time. 
While the others might happily sit around in the evening getting stoned, unconcerned about waking up 
late the next morning with a hangover, I was always aware of the need to keep a clear head.  
My parents and Lindi came up to help us sell copies o f the magazine. Mum took a bundle to 
Speaker’s  Corner  in  Hyde  Park  and  pushed  them  into  the  unsuspecting  hands  of  tourists.  Lindi  and  I  
walked up and down Oxford Street selling copies of Student  to anybody we could stop. I was once 
with Lindi when a tramp came up and asked for money. We had no money – that’s  exactly  what  we  
were looking for too – but in a histrionic fit of idealism I stripped off most of my clothes and gave 
them to him. I spent the rest of the day walking around in a blanket.  
‘Poor  old  tram p!’  Dad  chuckled  when  he  heard  the  story.  ‘That’ll  teach  him.  All  he  wanted  was  
some  loose  change,  and  he  got  a  set  of  infested  clothes  from  you!’  
Student  began to attract a high profile, and one day a German television channel asked me whether I 
would mak e a speech at University College, London, along with the activist Tariq Ali and the German 
student leader Danny Cohn -Bendit.   The   brief   was   to   talk   about   people’s   rights.   A   vast   crowd  
welcomed these two firebrand revolutionaries. I stood and listened as Dan ny Cohn -Bendit made a 
brilliant speech full of intellectual depth and passion. Everyone around him was cheering and roaring 
their approval. Then Tariq Ali stood up, and he too made a passionate speech. The crowd stamped and 
shouted at the tops of their voi ces as if they were about to descend upon the Bastille. I began to feel a 
little queasy.  
At Stowe there had been a very cruel tradition. Each boy had to learn a long poem and stand up 
in front of the entire school and recite it. If you made the slightest m istake or paused for a moment, the 
master hit a gong, and you had to leave the stage accompanied by great boos and jeers all round: you 
were  ‘gonged’  off.  Since  I  was  mildly  dyslexic  I  found  it  extremely  difficult  to  learn  anything  by  
heart, and for severa l years was gonged off with relentless regularity. As I watched Danny Cohn -
Bendit and Tariq Ali making their inspiring speeches, surfing on the goodwill of the crowd and 
milking the television camera for all it was worth, I felt the same sickening feeling in my stomach as I 
had felt when I was waiting to recite my Tennyson piece in the sure knowledge that I would be 
‘gonged’  off  stage  and  loudly  booed.  
Finally Tariq Ali finished his speech. There was pandemonium. Everyone cheered; somebody 
hoisted him on th eir shoulders; pretty girls waved admiringly up at him and the camera swivelled in 
his direction. Then somebody beckoned to me: it was my turn. I hopped up to the podium and 
nervously took the microphone. I had barely spoken in public, let alone made a spe ech before, and I 
felt chronically nervous. I had absolutely no idea what to say. I had prepared a speech but, under the 
scrutiny of a thousand expectant faces turned towards me like sunflowers, my mind had gone 
completely blank. Dry -mouthed, I mumbled a f ew words, gave a sick smile, and realised with a 
mounting feeling of panic that I could not do it. There was nowhere to hide. I gave a final inarticulate 
mumble, somewhere between a cough and a vomit, dropped the microphone, leapt off the podium and 
disapp eared back into the safety of the crowd. It had been the most embarrassing moment of my life.  
Even now, whenever I am interviewed or have to give a speech, I feel the same trepidation and I 
have  to  overcome  the  same  sense  of  shyness.  If  I’m  talking  on  a  su bject that I know a little about, or 
that  I  feel  passionately  about,  then  I  can  be  reasonably  fluent.  But,  when  I’m  asked  to  talk  about  something I know very little about, I become extremely uncomfortable – and it shows. I have come to 
accept that I will n ever have all the smooth instant answers that a politician would have. I try not to 
fight my stutters or inability to leap to a perfect answer. Instead, I just try to give the truthful answer, 
and, if it takes a little time to work out that answer, I hope that people will trust a slow, hesitant 
response more than a rapid, glib one.  
The wars in Vietnam and Biafra were the two leading issues of the late 1960s. If Student  was to be a 
credible publication we had to have our own reporters in both countries. We h ad no money to send 
any reporters out there, let alone pay for them to stay in hotels and telex back articles, so we had to 
think laterally. We finally came up with the idea that if we chose very young reporters then they might 
be a story in themselves. So  I called up the Daily Mirror  and asked whether they would be interested 
in running an exclusive story about a seventeen -year-old reporter going to Vietnam. They bought the 
story and paid for Julian Manyon, who was working with us at Student , to go to Viet nam. Julian went 
there, filed some great articles about the Vietnam War, and subsequently went on to become a famous 
ITN reporter. We managed to make the same arrangement with sending a sixteen -year-old reporter to 
Biafra. These two ventures were my first experience of leveraging up the Student  name: we put in the 
name and the people, and the other side put up the money to fund it.  
I felt very passionately about the campaign to end American involvement in Vietnam. In October 
1968 all the Student  staff joine d Vanessa Redgrave on the student march to Grosvenor Square, to 
protest outside the American embassy. I marched alongside Vanessa and Tariq Ali. It was 
tremendously exciting to be marching for something I believed in, along with tens of thousands of 
others . The mood of the crowd was exhilarating, but at the same time slightly frightening. You felt at 
any moment that things could get out of control. And they did. When the police charged the crowd, I 
ran like hell. A photograph of the demonstration later appe ared in Paris Match . It shows me, back 
arched, an inch away from the outstretched hand of a policeman who was trying to catch me as I 
sprinted across the square.  
While  I  opposed  Vietnam,  I  didn’t  feel  as  passionately  left -wing on other issues as most of my  
fellow demonstrators.  
‘I  suppose  I  am  left -wing,’  I  told  a  reporter  from  the   Guardian .  ‘Well,  only  to  the  extent  that  I  
think left -wing  views  are  sane  and  rational.’  
Student  was   not   a   radical   magazine   in   the   political   sense.   Nor   were   we   an   ‘underground’  
magazine, like Oz and IT.  We  weren’t  advocating  putting  LSD  in  the  water  supply,  as  they  might  have  
done from time to time – although I think there was just as much free love in our offices as there was 
in theirs.  
I tried to maintain a balance between the v iews of the left and the right, but what I hoped was 
balance some people saw as prevarication. The writer and poet Robert Graves wrote to me from Deià, 
Majorca, where he lived:  
  
Your hands seem tied tighter than students deserve. In the Biafra story, for instance,  you  don’t  
once mention what the war is really  about in the international context. But that is because you have  to  keep  pals  with  the  ‘overthirties’  and  the  Big  Business  Boys,  or  the  journal  couldn’t  
survive. Yes, you do your best.  
In  fact,  the  ‘B ig  Business  Boys’  weren’t  being  as  friendly  as  I’d  hoped.  The  struggle  to  secure  
advertising had always been much more difficult than finding contributors. We were pleased to be 
able  to  interview  the  actor  Bryan  Forbes  or  publish  Gavin  Maxwell’s  article,  b ut  they  didn’t  bring  in  
money to help us run the magazine and distribute it. We charged £250 for a whole -page 
advertisement, down to £40 for an eighth of a page. For example, after countless calls I had managed 
to get nine companies to take out full -page a ds in the first edition: J Walter Thompson, Metal Box, the 
Sunday Times , the Daily Telegraph , The Gas Council (the forerunner to British Gas), The Economist , 
Lloyds Bank, Rank Organisation, and John Laing Builders. These nine advertisements had brought in 
£2,250 and had been wrung out of a list that started off with over 300 possible companies. But it had 
been enough to cover the cost of printing the 30,000 copies of the first issue. With these funds I had 
opened an account at Coutts, where my family had al ways banked, as our clearing bank. I must have 
been their only customer who walked in barefoot and asked for a £1,000 overdraft. Throughout the life 
of Student , selling advertising space was always an uphill struggle.  
For all our efforts, it was clear that  Student  wasn’t  making  money.  I  began  to  think  of  ways  to  
develop the magazine, and the Student  name, in other directions: a Student  conference, a Student  travel 
company, a Student  accommodation  agency.  I  didn’t  just  see   Student  as an end in itself, a noun. I saw 
it as the beginning of a whole range of services, an adjective, a word that people would recognise as 
having certain key values. In 1970s language, Student  magazine and everything Student  promoted 
should  be  ‘hip’.   Student  was a flexible concept and I wanted to explore this flexibility to see how far I 
could push it and where it would lead. In this way I was a little removed from the rest of my friends, 
who concentrated exclusively on the magazine and the student politics t hey wanted to cover.  
It seems Peter Blake was right in saying that student revolution would go out of fashion – and 
students with it. However, looking at the early editions of Student  thirty  years  later,  I’m  amazed  by  
how little has changed. Student  then h ad cartoons of Ted Heath by Nicholas Garland; he was still 
being caricatured right up until his death by Nicholas Garland. David Hockney, Dudley Moore and 
John Le Carré still make good copy, and Bryan Forbes and Vanessa Redgrave, or at least their 
daughter s, are still in the news.  
Life in the basement was the kind of all -embracing, glorious chaos in which I thrived and have 
thrived ever since. We never had any money; we were incredibly busy; but we were a close -knit team. 
We worked together because it was f un, because we felt that what we were doing was important, and 
because we had great lives together.  
Soon a number of journalists from the national papers came to interview me to see what all the 
buzz was about. We developed a foolproof way of impressing th em. I sat at my desk, the telephone at 
my elbow.  
‘Great  to  meet  you.  Take  a  seat,’  I  would  say,  waving  the  journalist  down  into  the  beanbag  
opposite me. As they shuffled around trying to retain their dignity, get comfortable, and remove the 
drips of houmou s and piles of cigarette ash from the folds, the telephone would ring.  ‘Can  someone  take  that,  please?’  I  would  ask.  ‘Now   –’  I  turned  my  attention  to  the  journalist  ‘ – 
what do you want to know about Student ?’ 
‘It’s  Ted  Heath  for  you,  Richard,’  Tony  would  c all across.  
‘I’ll  call  him  back,’  I’d  say  over  my  shoulder.  ‘Now,  what  did  you  want  to  know  about   Student ?’ 
By this time the journalist was craning round to watch Tony tell Ted Heath that he was sorry but 
Richard  was  in  a  meeting  and  he’d  call  him  back.  Th en the telephone would ring again, and Tony 
would pick it up.  
‘David  Bailey  for  you,  Richard.’  
‘I’ll  call  him  back,  but  will  you  ask  if  he  can  change  that  lunch  date?  I’ve  got  to  be  in  Paris.  OK   –
’  I’d  flash  an  apologetic  grin  at  the  journalist  ‘ – now, how  are  we  doing?’  
‘I  just  wanted  to  ask  you   –’ 
The telephone rang again.  
‘I’m  sorry  to  interrupt,’  Tony  would  apologise,  ‘but  it’s  Mick  Jagger  for  you  and  he  says  it’s  
urgent.’ 
‘Please  excuse  me  for  a  minute,’  I’d  say,  reluctantly  picking  up  the  phone.  ‘Mick , hello. Fine 
thanks,  and  you?  Really?  An  exclusive?  Yes,  that  sounds  great  …’  
And  on  I  went  until  Jonny  couldn’t  stop  laughing  in  the  call  box  opposite  or  the  pips  went.  
‘I’m  sorry,’  I’d  say  to  the  journalist.  ‘Something’s  cropped  up  and  we’ve  got  to  dash . Are we 
finished?’ 
The journalist would be ushered out in a daze, passing Jonny on the way, and the telephone 
would stop ringing.  
Journalists  swallowed  our  scam  hook,  line  and  sinker:  ‘Photographers,  journalists,  writers  from  
papers throughout the world s eem to have fallen over themselves in assisting Student ,’  wrote  the  
Sunday Telegraph ,  ‘and  a  massive  voluntary  distribution  organisation  has  grown  throughout  schools  
and  universities,  allowing,  perhaps,  over  half  a  million  students  to  read  the  magazine.’  
‘An amazing number of top -class  contributors.  Its  scope  is  limitless,’  said  the   Observer . While 
the Daily Telegraph  said,  ‘It  seems  probable  that   Student , the glossy publication that has attracted a lot 
of well -known writers, will become one of the largest circulated  magazines  in  the  country.’  
By  autumn  1968  Jonny’s  parents  had  understandably  had  enough  of  having  almost  twenty  teenagers  
squatting in their basement and asked us to find somewhere else to live. We moved to 44 Albion 
Street, just round the corne r from Connaught Square. Jonny left to go back to school and take his A 
levels. He felt guilty about abandoning me, but he was under pressure to continue his education, and his parents sensibly worried that working on a small magazine from their basement w as hardly the 
perfect foundation on which to earn much of a living.  
Without Jonny, Student  almost fell to pieces. There was too much for me to do, and nobody else 
whom I could really trust to help me out. After a few weeks, I asked Nik to come and help. Ni k had 
finished at Ampleforth, but was due to go to Sussex University at Brighton. He agreed to delay going 
to university and come to Student ’s  aid. 
With  Nik’s  arrival,   Student  was put back on the rails. He started controlling the cash, and, rather 
than hav ing a large biscuit tin full of money which anyone could dip into to buy food or drink or dope, 
Nik used our Coutts account properly. He started writing cheques and then checking the stubs off 
against the bank statements. Nik had lost a front tooth, and wi th his long black hair he looked rather 
terrifying. I think he kept away a lot of debt collectors.  
The  commune,  which  had  been  very  cramped  in  Jonny’s  basement,  now  spread  up  and  down  the  
new house. People made dens and there were mattresses and joss stick s everywhere. By now most of 
the people working with Student  were nineteen or twenty, and there was lots of talk about free love, 
and lots of practice of it. I installed a large brass bed on the top floor, with a telephone running off a 
long extension lead  which looped down through the banisters. Some days I did all my business from 
bed. 
I’d  put  the  house  in  my  parents’  name  so  that  the  owners   – the Church Commissioners – would 
not think we were running a business from it. My parents loved the excitement of  journalism and, 
although Dad was a barrister with short hair who wore a blazer and tie to church on Sundays, he and 
Mum  never  had  any  problem  talking  to  people  who  had  hair  halfway  down  their  backs  and  hadn’t  
shaved or washed for a month. Lindi came to st ay in Albion Street every half term and during some of 
her holidays. She helped distribute Student  and fell in love with a series of men working on the 
magazine.  
I had a short relationship with Debbie, one of the girls living at Albion Street and working o n the 
magazine. One day she told me she was pregnant. We were both very shocked and realised that a baby 
was the last thing we could cope with. Debbie decided that she wanted to have an abortion. After a 
few telephone calls it became clear that this would be very difficult to arrange. Debbie could not have 
an abortion on the National Health Service unless she had proven psychiatric or medical problems. We 
grew frantic phoning around all the National Health hospitals trying to see if there was any way this 
could be overcome. When we tried to find a private doctor to help, we found it would cost over £400 – 
money   we   didn’t   have.   I   was   at   my   wits’   end   when   I   finally   tracked   down   a   kind   doctor   in  
Birmingham who told me that she would arrange the operation for £5 0. 
After the operation, Debbie and I realised that there must be a host of young people who had 
faced the same problem and had nowhere to turn for help. It would surely be much better if there were 
one telephone number you could ring to be referred to the right  doctor.  It  wasn’t  just  unwanted  
pregnancies that were the problem: what if you needed psychological help, or had a venereal disease 
but were scared of admitting it to your nice family doctor, or had run away from home and had 
nowhere to live? We drew  up a long list of the sorts of problems that students faced, and decided to do 
something about it. We would give out our telephone number, work out a list of all the best and most 
helpful doctors, and see who called.  GIVE US YOUR HEADACHES  was the slogan for the Student Advisory Centre. We handed out 
leaflets along Oxford Street and advertised in Student . Soon the calls started coming in. A number of 
doctors, both in the National Health Service and the private sector, agreed to give their services for 
free or a minimal charge, so we built up a network of professionals to whom we could refer people. 
Worries about pregnancy and contraception formed many of the calls, but we also became quite a 
centre for gay men and lesbians to hang around. It soon became cle ar that they were not as interested 
in asking our advice as in finding ways of meeting each other, revealing how difficult it was for gay 
people to lead a normal social life.  
The Student Advisory Centre began to take up more time than Student  magazine. I would be 
talking to possible suicides for an hour at three in the morning, advising pregnant girls as to who was 
the nicest doctor they could go and see, writing to someone who was terrified that he had caught 
venereal  disease  but  didn’t  dare  t ell his parents or go and see a doctor – and in what little time was 
left, trying to run the magazine. One of the biggest problems we found ourselves dealing with was that 
teenagers  were  unable  to  confide  in  their  parents.  Hearing  others’  stories  made  me  r ealise how lucky I 
was in my relationship with my own parents. They had never judged me, and always supported me, 
always praised the good things rather than criticised the bad things: I had no qualms about admitting 
my problems, worries and failures. Our w ork was to try to help out those who were in trouble but with 
nowhere to turn.  
With both the Student Advisory Centre and Student  magazine, life at Albion Street remained 
frantic and the numbers of people coming in and out of the house at all times of day and night 
continued to drive our neighbours to distraction. Due to complaints from the neighbours, we were 
visited on a regular ba sis by the Church Commissioner inspectors to check that we were not carrying 
out any kind of business. These visits had all the clockwork tension of a West End farce. The 
Commissioners  had  to  give  us  24  hours’  notice  before  an  inspection,  and  as  soon  as  we  received it the 
whole Student  staff and my mum immediately wheeled into action.  
All the telephones were piled into a cupboard, and the desks and chairs and mattresses were 
covered by dust sheets. The Student  staff would pull out paint pots and paintbrushe s, put on overalls 
and start painting the walls of the house. Mum would arrive from the country with Lindi, eight -year-
old Vanessa and an armful of toys. By the time the Church Commissioners arrived they would find a 
friendly crew of painters cheerfully de corating the house, the furniture all swathed in dust sheets, 
while a mother and her family huddled upstairs. The little girl would be playing with some toys in a 
rather bemused way, while Lindi and I were engrossed in Monopoly. If Vanessa ever looked as i f she 
might ask us what was going on, Mum would rapidly shoo everyone out of the room, saying it was 
time  for  Vanessa’s  bed.  
The Church inspectors would look at this happy domestic scene and wonder what all the fuss was 
about. They would scratch their head s and say what a lovely girl little Vanessa was, drink their tea and 
have a nice chat with my mum. As soon as they had disappeared down the street, Mum went back 
home; we put away the Monopoly, yanked off the dust sheets, plugged in the telephones and got back 
to work.  
The end came on one fatal visit when we forgot to unplug the telephones. By then it was their 
fifth visit and the inspectors must have suspected something. They stayed for their ritual cup of tea and were just about to leave when two of the t elephones started ringing inside the cupboard. A shocked 
silence fell.  
‘And  just  listen  to  that,’  I  improvised  quickly.  ‘Can  you  hear  that  telephone?  The  walls  are  so  
thin  in  these  houses  we  can  hear  everything  that  goes  on  next  door!’  
The inspector strode  forward and pulled open the cupboard door. Five telephones, a switchboard 
and a tangle of wires all tumbled out on top of him. Not even a big family needed a switchboard. That 
was the end of 44 Albion Street. Vanessa and her collection of dolls and toys w ere taken down to 
Shamley Green for the last time, and Lindi and I packed up the Monopoly set. Student  magazine had 
to find somewhere else to use as an office.  
We scoured the neighbourhood looking for somewhere to rent. The best deal was offered by the 
Reverend Cuthbert Scott. He liked the work of the Advisory Centre and offered us the use of the crypt 
at  St  John’s  Church,  just  off  the  Bayswater  Road,  for  no  rent  at  all.  I  put  an  old  slab  of  marble  across  
two tombs to make my desk, and everyone found themse lves somewhere to sit. We even charmed the 
local Post Office engineer into connecting the telephone without our having to wait the normal three 
months. After a while none of us noticed that we were working in the dim light of the crypt 
surrounded by marble  effigies and tombs.  
In November 1969 I received a visit from two plain -clothes policemen from Marylebone Police 
Station. They had come to draw my attention to the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act and the 1917 
Venereal Disease Act, in case I was unaware of  them, which, not surprisingly, I was. They told me 
that it was illegal to advertise any help or remedy for venereal disease. These Acts had originally been 
introduced to stop quack doctors from exploiting the large numbers of people who came to them for 
expensive and ineffective cures for venereal disease. I argued that I was only offering a counselling 
service  and  that  I  passed  on  anyone  who  had  VD  to  qualified  doctors  at  St  Mary’s  Hospital.  But  the  
policemen were adamant: if the Student Advisory Centre c ontinued  to  mention  the  words  ‘venereal  
disease’  in  public,  I  would  be  arrested  with  the  prospect  of  two  years’  imprisonment.  
The week before, we had successfully prosecuted a policeman from Marylebone Police Station 
for planting drugs on one of the Studen t  Advisory  Centre’s  clients.  The  policeman  had  been  sent  
down, and so I suspected that this visit was connected. I was amazed that the police had trawled 
through this old legislation to find some obscure law that we were breaking.  
We duly changed the menti on of venereal disease in the leaflets we distributed around London 
and  started  describing  it  as  ‘social  disease’.  Then  we  got  a  huge  number  of  inquiries  from  people  who  
were suffering from acne, and the number of people calling us for help over VD dropped  from sixty a 
week to ten. We decided that the police were bluffing and that helping the remaining fifty people a 
week  was  worth  risking  the  Metropolitan  Police’s  threats:  we  reinserted  the  mention  of  VD.  We  were  
wrong. The police came back to the crypt ag ain, in December 1969, and arrested me.  
John Mortimer, a barrister who had established a reputation for his support of libertarian causes 
after his defence of Oz magazine and his role in the Lady  Chatterley’s  Lover  trial, offered to defend 
me. He agreed th at the law was ridiculous and that the police were merely being vindictive. John 
reminded us that every public lavatory carried a government notice on the inside of the door offering 
advice to those suffering from venereal disease. If I was guilty then so was the government. I was duly prosecuted on two counts: under the Indecent Advertisements Act 1889, which prohibited 
advertisements  of  an  ‘indecent  or  obscene  nature’  and  deemed  references  to  syphilis  and  gonorrhoea  
to be indecent, and the Venereal Diseas e Act 1917, which banned advertisements offering treatment or 
advice  or  mentioning  the  words  ‘venereal  disease’.  
At the first hearing on 8 May 1970 at the Marylebone Magistrates Court, Tom Driberg, the 
flamboyant Labour MP until 1974, gave a dramatic plea on my behalf. Chad Varah, the founder of the 
Samaritans, also gave evidence pointing out how many people the Student Advisory Centre had 
referred to his charity. John Mortimer made his argument that, if I was found guilty, I would have no 
option but to pro secute the government and all the local authorities, since they had also put up notices 
in public lavatories. The magistrate dismissed the charge under the Venereal Disease Act on the 
grounds that the Student Advisory Centre did not offer to cure people bu t referred them to qualified 
doctors. He adjourned the other charge until 22 May.  
As the court case was proceeding, statistics were released revealing that the number of people 
with venereal disease had risen dramatically in the previous year to a post -war peak. Lady Birk, the 
chairman of the Health Education Council, used the statistics together with the example of my 
prosecution to try to amend the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act in the House of Lords.  
‘It’s  ludicrous  that  outmoded  laws  should  restrict  r esponsible efforts to stop the spread of these 
serious  diseases,’  she  said.  
By the time of the second court case a number of newspapers had declared how idiotic it was that 
I was being prosecuted. There was a strong movement to change the law. The magistra te reluctantly 
found me guilty under the strict letter of the law, but he made it clear that he considered the law was 
absurd  by  fining  me  just  £7,  some  way  short  of  the  two  years’  imprisonment  with  which  the  police  had  
been threatening me. John Mortimer m ade a statement to the press outside the court in which he called 
for the law to be changed or we would have no alternative but to prosecute the government for 
mentioning VD on the doors of public lavatories. The newspapers all joined forces behind us, and  
Lady  Birk’s  amendment  to  the  law  was  incorporated  into  government  legislation  at  the  next  sitting  of  
parliament. Reginald Maudling, the home secretary, sent me a personal letter apologising for the 
Crown Prosecution.  
That court case taught me that, althou gh I was young, wore jeans and had very little money 
behind me, I need not be afraid of being bullied by the police or the Establishment. Particularly if I 
had a good barrister.  
One day in 1970 I came back to my desk and found that Nik had been sitting at it. By mistake he had 
left a draft of a memo which he was writing to the staff. It was a plan to get rid of me as publisher and 
editor, take editorial and financial control of Student  and turn it into a cooperative. I would become 
just part of the team, an d everyone would share equally in the editorial direction of the magazine. I 
was shocked. I felt that Nik – my closest friend – was betraying me. After all, Student  had been my 
and  Jonny’s  idea.  We  had  started  it  at  Stowe  and  against  all  odds  we  had  manage d to publish it. I knew 
what I wanted to do with Student , and it seemed to me that everyone was happy working there. We all 
drew equal salaries, but ultimately I was the editor and publisher and it was up to me to make the 
decisions.  I looked around at eve ryone working. They all had their heads bent down studiously over their 
desks. I wondered how many were part of this. I put the memo in my pocket. When Nik came back I 
stood up.  
‘Nik,’  I  said.  ‘Will  you  come  outside  for  a  quick  chat?’  
I decided to bluff my  way through the crisis. If Nik had already whipped up support from the ten 
other people it would be difficult for me to stop them. But, if they were undecided, I could drive a 
wedge between Nik and the rest of them and cut Nik out. I had to put our friend ship to one side, and 
get rid of this challenge.  
‘Nik,’  I  said,  as  we  walked  down  the  street,  ‘a  number  of  people  have  come  up  to  me  and  said  
that  they’re  unhappy  with  what  you’re  planning.  They  don’t  like  the  idea,  but  they’re  too  scared  to  tell  
you to yo ur  face.’ 
Nik looked horrified.  
‘I  don’t  think  that  it’s  a  good  idea  for  you  to  stay  here,’  I  went  on.  ‘You’re  trying  to  undermine  
me and the whole of Student .  I  think  that  we  should  remain  friends,  but  I  don’t  think  you  should  stay  
here  any  more.’  
I still  don’t  know  how  I  managed  to  say  those  words  without  blushing  or  my  voice  cracking.  Nik  
looked down at his feet.  
‘I’m  sorry,  Ricky,’  he  said.  ‘It  just  seemed  a  better  way  to  organise  ourselves  …’  he  trailed  off.  
‘I’m  sorry  too,  Nik.’  I  folded  my  arms  and  l ooked  straight  at  him.  ‘Let’s  see  each  other  down  in  
Shamley Green, but Student  is  my  life.’ 
Nik left that day. I told everyone that Nik and I had disagreed over how to run Student , and they 
were free to leave, or to carry on, whatever they wished. They al l decided to stay with me, and life at 
the crypt went on without Nik.  
This was the first real disagreement I ever had. Although I felt anguished, I knew I had to 
confront it. I hate criticising people who work with me, and I try to avoid doing so. Ever sin ce then I 
have always tried to avoid the issue by asking someone else to wield the axe. I admit that this is a 
weakness, but I am simply unable to cope with it.  
Nik was my best friend and I deeply hoped that he would remain so. When I was next down in 
Sham ley  Green  I  went  round  to  see  Nik  and  found  him  eating  one  of  his  mum’s  puddings.  We  sat  
down together and polished it off.  
Apart from the fact that he was my oldest friend, Nik had taken charge of the distribution of the 
magazine and made sense of it. I missed him terribly. Until Nik had arrived, the distribution had only 
ever been casually handled, with bundles being sent out  to volunteers in schools and universities. For 
over a year Student  carried on without Nik and we put out four more editions. When Nik told me that 
he was standing for a student election at Sussex University, I used Student ’s  purchasing  power  with  the prin ters to run off some cheap campaign posters. Nik won the election but was later disqualified 
because he had got outside support for his campaign.  
One thing I knew from everyone who came in to chat or work for us was that they spent a good deal of 
time list ening to music, and a good deal of money buying records. We had the record player on 
constantly, and everyone rushed out to buy the latest Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, or Jefferson Airplane 
album the day it was released. There was tremendous excitement about  music: it was political; it was 
anarchic;;  it  summed  up  the  young  generation’s  dream  of  changing  the  world.  And  I  also  noticed  that  
people  who  would  never  dream  of  spending  as  much  as  40  shillings  on  a  meal  wouldn’t  hesitate  to  
spend 40 shillings buying th e latest Bob Dylan album. The more obscure the albums were, the more 
they cost and the more they were treasured.  
Up to this point I had been interested in making money only to ensure Student ’s  continuing  
success and to fund the Student Advisory Centre, but it struck me as a very interesting business 
opportunity.  When  I  heard  that,  despite  the  government’s  abolition  of  the  Retail  Price  Maintenance  
Agreement, none of the shops were offering dis counted records, I began to think about setting up a 
record distribution business. The number of people working on Student  had grown to around twenty 
and we all still lived together in 44 Albion Street and worked in the crypt.  
I thought about the high cost  of records and the sort of people who bought Student  magazine, and 
wondered whether we could advertise and sell cheap mail -order records through the magazine. As it 
turned out, the first advertisement for mail -order records appeared in the final edition o f Student . 
Without Nik to manage Student ’s  distribution,  it  was  floundering,  but  the  offer  of  cheap  records  
brought in a flood of inquiries and more cash than we had ever seen before.  
We decided to come up with another name for the mail -order business: a n ame that would be 
eye-catching, that could stand alone and not appeal just to students. We sat around in the church crypt 
trying to choose a good one.  
‘Slipped  Disc’  was  one  of  the  favourite  suggestions.  We  toyed  with  it  for  a  while,  until  one  of  the  
girls leant forward:  
‘I  know,’  she  said.  ‘What  about  “Virgin”?  We’re  complete  virgins  at  business.’  
‘And  there  aren’t  many  virgins  left  around  here,’  laughed  one  of  the  other  girls.  ‘It  would  be  nice  
to  have  one  here  in  name  if  nothing  else.’  
‘Great,’  I  decided  on  the  spot.  ‘It’s  Virgin.’

AND SO WE BECAME  Virgin.  Looking  back  at  the  various  uses  to  which  we’ve  since  put  the  Virgin  
name,  I  think  we  made  the  right  decision.  I’m  not  sure  that  Slipped  Disc  Airways,  S lipped Disc Brides 
or Slipped Disc Condoms would have had quite the same appeal.  
Our tiny sample of market research proved correct: students spent a good deal of money on 
records  and  they  didn’t  like  spending  39  shillings  at  WH  Smith  when  they  found  out  th at they could 
buy them from Virgin for 35 shillings. We started giving out leaflets about Virgin Mail Order records 
along Oxford Street and outside concerts, and the daily post increased from a bundle of letters to a 
sack. One of the best things about mail  order for us was that the customers sent their money in first: 
this provided the capital for us to buy the records. Our bank account at Coutts started to build up a 
large cash balance.  
As Virgin Mail Order grew, I tried to sell Student  to another magazine  group. IPC Magazines 
emerged as the only interested buyer, and we had long negotiations which culminated in a meeting 
where they asked me to stay on as editor. I agreed to do so, but then made the mistake of telling them 
all about my future plans. Fantasi sing about the future is one of my favourite pastimes, and I told the 
meeting that I had all sorts of other plans for Student : I felt that students were given a raw deal by 
banks, and I wanted to set up a cheap student bank; I wanted to set up a string of great nightclubs and 
hotels where students could stay; perhaps even offer them good travel, like student trains or even, who 
knows, a student airline. As I warmed to my theme, I saw that their eyes had glazed over. They 
thought I was a madman. They decided  they did not want to keep such a lunatic on as editor of 
Student , and in the end they decided they did not even want to buy it. Student  died a quiet death, and 
my plans for the future had to be shelved for the time being.  
We switched all our attention to Virgin Mail Order. One look at the huge numbers of orders 
coming in and the need to organise where to buy the records from and how to send them out to the 
customers persuaded me that I needed someone to help me. Although we all had great fun at Albion 
Street, I was increasingly aware that I was the only one who had to worry about paying all the wages. 
Even though these were small amounts of money, it was difficult to make sufficient profit even to 
cover that cost. There was only one person I could turn to: Nik. I wanted my old friend back again.  
I buried the episode when Nik had tried to throw me out, and offered him 40 per cent of the 
newly formed Virgin Mail Order Records company if he came to work with me. He agreed 
immediately. We never negotiated over t he 60 –40 split. I think we both felt that it was a fair reflection 
of what we would each put into the business.  
Although Nik was not a trained accountant, he was meticulous at counting the pennies. He also 
led by example: he never spent any money, so why s hould any of us? He never washed his clothes, so 
why should anyone else? He scrimped and saved every penny; he always turned lights off when he left 
a room; he made only rapid phone calls, and he handled our bills with great skill.  
‘It’s  fine  to  pay  bills   late,’  he  said,  ‘so  long  as  you  pay  them  regularly.’  So we paid our bills on the nail, except that it was always the last nail. Apart from Nik and me, 
there were no other permanent employees in the crypt. A rotating band of casual workers came in and 
were paid £20 a week, before drifting on. Throughout 1970 Virgin Mail Order Records thrived.  
Then, in January 1971, we were almost ruined by something entirely out of our control: the Post 
Office workers went on strike. Led by Tom Jackson, the general secretary  of the Union of Post Office 
Workers, the postmen went home and the Post Office taped up the letterboxes. Our mail -order 
business  was  set  to  go  bust:  people  couldn’t  send  us  cheques;;  we  couldn’t  send  out  records.  We  had  to  
do something.  
Nik and I decided t hat we should open a shop to carry on selling the records. We had to find a 
shop within a week before we ran out of money. At the time we had no idea about how a shop works. 
All we knew was that we had to sell records somehow or the company would collapse.  We started 
looking for a site.  
In 1971 music retailing was dominated by WH Smith and John Menzies, both of which were dull 
and formal. The record departments were generally downstairs and they were staffed by people in drab 
brown or blue uniforms who appe ared to have no interest in music. Customers chose their records 
from the shelves, bought them and left within ten minutes. The shops were unwelcoming; there was 
little sympathetic service and prices were high. Although rock music was very exciting, none o f that 
feeling of excitement or even vague interest filtered through to the shops that sold the records. The 
dowdy staff registered no approval or interest if you bought the new Doors album: they just rang it up 
on the till as if you had bought Mantovani o r Perry Como. It was all the same to them. Nor did they 
seem particularly enthused about putting in a special order for the Van Der Graaf Generator or 
Incredible String Band record that had been reviewed in Melody Maker  that week. None of our friends 
felt at home in record shops: they were just rather functional places where they had to go to buy their 
favourite records. Hence the appeal of a cheap mail -order business.  
We wanted the Virgin Records shop to be an extension of Student ; a place where people cou ld 
meet  and  listen  to  records  together;;  somewhere  where  they  weren’t  simply  encouraged  to  dash  in,  buy  
the record and leave. We wanted them to stay longer, chat to the staff, and really get into which 
records they were going to buy. People take music far m ore seriously than many other things in life. It 
is part of the way they define themselves, like the cars they drive, the films they watch, and the clothes 
they wear. Teenagers spend more time listening to music, talking about their favourite bands and 
choosing records than almost anything else.  
Virgin’s  first  record  shop  had  to  incorporate  all  these  aspects  of  how  music  fitted  into  people’s  
lives. In exploring how to do this, I think we created the conceptual framework of what Virgin later 
became. We wante d the Virgin Records shop to be an enjoyable place to go at a time when record 
buyers were given short shrift. We wanted to relate to the customers, not patronise them; and we 
wanted to be cheaper than the other shops. To achieve all this was a tall order,  but we hoped the extra 
money which went on creating the atmosphere, and the profits we forfeited by selling cheaply, would 
be more than made up for by people buying more records.  
Nik and I spent a morning counting people walking up and down Oxford Street compared with 
people walking along Kensington High Street. Eventually we decided that the cheaper end of Oxford 
Street  would  be  the  best  site.  We  knew  that  we  couldn’t  rely  on  people  knowing  about  the  Virgin  Records shop and making a special trip to buy a record, so we had to be able to attract passers -by into 
the shop on impulse. At the exact point where we counted the most people walking along the street, 
we started looking for an empty property. We saw a shoe shop with a stairway leading up to what 
looke d like an empty first floor, so we went upstairs to see what it was like.  
‘What  are  you  doing?’  a  voice  called  up  to  us.  
‘We’re  looking  to  set  up  a  shop,’  we  said.  
‘What  kind  of  shop?’  
Nik and I came back down the stairs and found the owner of the shoe shop blocking our way.  
‘A  record  shop,’  we  said.  
The owner was a large, square Greek called Mr Alachouzos.  
‘You’ll  never  pay  the  rent,’  he  said.  
‘No,  you’re  right,’  I  said.  ‘We  can’t  afford  any  rent.  But  we’ll  attract  lots  of  people  past  your  
window  and  they’ll  all  buy  shoes.’  
‘What  kind  of  shoes?’  Mr  Alachouzos’s  eyes  narrowed.  
‘Jesus  sandals  are  out,’  Nik  said.  ‘Do  you  sell  any  Doc  Martens?’  
We a greed that we would fit out the record shop and that we could occupy it for no rent until 
somebody else came along and wanted it. It was, after all, just an empty space. Within five days we 
had built shelves, put piles of cushions on the floor, carried a c ouple of old sofas up the stairs and set 
up a till. The first Virgin Records shop was ready for business.  
The day before opening, we handed out hundreds of leaflets along Oxford Street offering cut -
price records. On the first day, a Monday, a queue over a hundred yards long formed outside. I was on 
the till when the customers started coming through. The first customer bought a record by Tangerine 
Dream, a German band which we had noticed selling very well through mail order.  
‘Funny  bloke  you’ve  got  downstai rs,’  he  said.  ‘He  kept  trying  to  sell  me  a  pair  of  Doc  Martens  as  
I  waited  in  the  queue.’  
At the end of the day I took the money to the bank. I found Mr Alachouzos hovering outside the 
shop. 
‘How’s  business?’  I  asked,  trying  to  make  light  of  the  heavy  bag   of cash I was carrying.  
He looked at me and then back at his shop window, which was still piled high with unsold Doc 
Martens.  
‘Fine,’  he  said  firmly.  ‘Couldn’t  be  better.’  During 1971 Nik was running the Oxford Street record shop; Debbie was running the St udent 
Advisory Centre from Piccadilly, and I was generally looking to do anything I could to expand. We 
were in the process of changing from Student  ideas to Virgin, and in due course we renamed the 
Student Advisory Centre as a new charity called HELP! It continues to operate to this day, but now 
under the guise of Virgin Unite, which undertakes a very broad range of charitable activities.  
I knew very little about the record industry, but from what I saw at the record shop I could see 
that it was a wonderfu lly informal business with no strict rules. It had unlimited potential for growth: a 
new band could suddenly sweep the nation and be a huge hit, as the sudden crazes for The Bay City 
Rollers, Culture Club, The Spice Girls or Busted show. The music business  is a strange combination 
of having real and intangible assets: pop bands are brand names in themselves, and at a given stage in 
their careers their name alone can practically guarantee hit records. But it is also an industry in which 
the few successful ba nds are very, very rich, and the bulk of bands remains obscure and impoverished. 
The rock business is a prime example of the most ruthless kind of capitalism.  
As a record retailer, Virgin was immune to the success or failure of an individual band, just so 
long as there were bands whose records people were keen to buy. But we were restricted to living off 
our retail margin, which was small, and I saw that the real potential for making money in the record 
industry lay in the record companies.  
For the time bei ng Nik and I concentrated on building up the image of our shop. We continued to 
work on different ideas to make our customers as welcome as possible. We offered them headphones, 
sofas and beanbags to sit on, free copies of New Musical Express  and Melody Ma ker to read, and free 
coffee to drink. We allowed them to stay as long as they liked and make themselves at home.  
Word of mouth began to spread, and soon people began to choose to buy records from us rather 
than from the big chains. It was as if they thoug ht that the same album by Thin Lizzy or Bob Dylan 
somehow had a greater value if bought at Virgin rather than at Boots. I felt enormous pride whenever I 
saw people carrying Virgin paper bags along Oxford Street. Our staff began to report that the same 
peop le  were  coming  back  every  couple  of  weeks.  With  a  loyal  customer  base,  Virgin’s  reputation  
began to grow.  
* * *  
At the other end of the spectrum from buying records – the recording studios – I heard that conditions 
were extremely formal. Bands had to check  in at an appointed time, bring all their own equipment and 
set it up, and then leave according to the set timetable, taking all their equipment with them. Since the 
studios were so overbooked, bands would often have to record straight after breakfast. The  idea of The 
Rolling  Stones  having  to  record  ‘Brown  Sugar’  straight  after  finishing  their  bowls  of  cornflakes  struck  
me as ridiculous. I imagined that the best environment for making records would be a big, comfortable 
house in the country where a band cou ld come and stay for weeks at a time and record whenever they 
felt like it, probably in the evening. So during 1971 I started looking for a country house that I could 
convert into a recording studio.  
In one copy of Country Life  I saw a fairy -tale castle on  sale in Wales for just £2,000. It seemed a 
bargain. I drove off to see it with Tom Newman, one of the early recruits to the Virgin Mail Order 
company. He was a singer who had already released a couple of records, but was more interested in setting up a re cording studio. When we arrived at the castle we realised that the sales details had 
inexplicably forgotten to point out that this castle was actually in the middle of a housing estate.  
Feeling tired and disappointed, Tom and I turned back and set off on t he five -hour drive back to 
London. Thumbing through Country Life  on the way home, I saw an advertisement for another 
property, the old manor house at Shipton -on-Cherwell, some five miles north of Oxford. We turned 
off the road, followed the signs to Shipto n-on-Cherwell, drove through the village, and then turned 
down a dead end which led to the Manor. The gates to the Manor were locked, but Tom and I climbed 
over the wall and found ourselves in the grounds of a beautiful seventeenth -century manor house buil t 
with yellow Cotswold stone which glowed in the late -afternoon sunshine. We walked round the 
outside of the house and both realised that this would be perfect.  
When we called the estate agent the next morning, we discovered that the Manor had been on the 
market for a long time. With over fifteen bedrooms it was too big for a family house but too small to 
be converted into a hotel. The asking price was £35,000, but he agreed £30,000 for a quick sale. I went 
in to see Coutts, this time wearing a suit and a p air of black shoes, and asked for a loan. I showed them 
the sales figures which Virgin Mail Order and the Virgin shop on Oxford Street were achieving. I 
don’t  know  how  impressed  they  were  by  them,  but  they  offered  me  a  mortgage  of  £20,000.  Some  
years later  Coutts told me that, if I ever came in to see them looking remotely smart, they knew I was 
in trouble.  
The Coutts loan was a breakthrough for me: it was the first time a bank had trusted me with a 
large amount of debt and I could see that I was almost in a position to buy the Manor. Although I had 
no money myself, my parents had put £2,500 aside for me, Lindi and Vanessa respectively for when 
we were thirty. I asked them if I could draw on it early and use it to buy the Manor. They both agreed, 
even though  there was a risk that, if the recording studio went bust, the bank would sell the Manor 
over my head at a knockdown price and the money would be lost. I was still looking at a shortfall of 
£7,500.  
We were talking about the Manor over Sunday lunch at Shaml ey Green when my dad suggested 
that I go and see Auntie Joyce. Auntie Joyce had no children of her own, and had always been devoted 
to us. Her fiancé had been killed in the war and she had never fallen in love again. She lived in 
Hampshire and I drove over  to see her that afternoon. As always she was both very straightforward 
and very generous. She had arranged everything.  
‘Ricky,  I’ve  heard  about  this  Manor,’  she  told  me.  ‘And  I  gather  that  Coutts  have  lent  you  some  
money.’ 
‘Yes.’ 
‘But  not  quite  enough.’  
‘No.’ 
‘Well,  I’ll  step  in  with  the  balance.  I  want  the  same  interest  as  Coutts,’  she  said.  ‘But  you  can  
delay  paying  it  to  me  until  you  are  able  to.’  I knew that Auntie Joyce was being extraordinarily kind to me and had probably accepted that 
she would nev er  see  the  money  again.  What  I  didn’t  know  was  that  she  had  remortgaged  her  house  to  
raise the £7,500 to pass on to me, and was having to pay interest on it herself. When I started thanking 
her she brushed me aside.  
‘Look,’  she  said,  ‘I  wouldn’t  lend  you  t he  money  if  I  didn’t  want  to.  What’s  money  for,  anyway?  
It’s  to  make  things  happen.  And  I’m  sure  you’ll  make  things  happen  with  this  recording  studio  just  as  
you  won  that  ten  shillings  off  me  when  you  learnt  to  swim.’  
I promised to myself that, whatever ha ppened, I would repay that money to her, with interest on 
top. 
I had only dealt with the estate agent over the telephone, but after the money was transferred and 
I had bought the Manor I went to pick up the key. I wandered into his office.  
‘Can  I  help  you? ’  he  said,  no  doubt  wondering  what  a  scruff  like  me  could  possibly  want  in  a  
smart  estate  agent’s  office.  
‘I’ve  come  to  pick  up  the  key  to  the  Manor,’  I  said.  ‘I’m  Richard  Branson.’  
He looked astonished.  
‘Yes,  Mr  Branson.’  He  pulled  out  a  large  iron  key.  ‘ Here you are. The key to the Manor. Please 
sign  here.’ 
And, with a flourish on his paper, I picked up the key and drove off to take possession of the 
Manor.  
Tom Newman together with his friend Phil Newell immediately set about converting the Manor 
outhouse  into a recording studio. He wanted to install a state -of-the-art sixteen -track Ampex tape 
machine together with the best of everything else he could think of: a twenty -channel desk, 
quadraphonic monitoring, phasing and echo facilities, and a grand piano. We both wanted to ensure 
that everything was as good as the best studio in London. The Manor gradually took shape. Every 
weekend I drove up with Nik and we would camp on the floor and knock out the partitions which had 
been put across the fireplaces, strip  off the lino to get down to the original flagstone floors, and paint 
the walls. Lindi also came up and helped, as did most of the people involved in Virgin Records. Mum 
arrived one day with a grandfather clock she had just bought at Phillips.  
‘You’ll  need  this,’  she  said.  
We  put  it  in  the  hallway  and  kept  our  money  in  the  casement.  It’s  now  standing  in  the  Virgin  
Upper Class lounge at Heathrow, but without the money stuffed inside.  
When the lease on Albion Street expired I moved in with some friends around  Notting Hill for a 
while, as we carried on working in the crypt. Soon we were too crowded to stay in the crypt, and we 
found an old warehouse in South Wharf Road, near Paddington Station, which became the base for 
Virgin Mail Order.  One day I found myself driving beneath the Westway and into Maida Vale. As I drove over a 
humpback bridge I saw a line of houseboats moored along the canal. With the water, lines of trees, 
boats brightly painted in reds and blues with flowerpots on their r ooftops, and various ducks and 
swans nosing around, it felt as if I was suddenly in the countryside.  
Since  I  was  brought  up  running  wild  in  the  country,  I  didn’t  really  like  living  in  London  and  often  
felt that I never saw the sunshine or breathed any fres h air. Ever since our summer holidays in 
Salcombe I had always loved the water and the smells of boats: oil, tar and ropes. I drove round to the 
local council office. They told me to go to the Water Board, which was responsible for allocating 
houseboats. T hey warned me that there was a long waiting list. If I applied now, I might eventually be 
allocated  one  in  about  five  years’  time.  I  didn’t  bother  to  apply,  but  drove  back  to  Little  Venice,  
hoping to find somebody on a houseboat who could tell me how to re nt one. I felt sure that there must 
be a way round the system.  
As I drove down Blomfield Road along the canal, my car broke down. This was not unusual. I 
got out and stared hopelessly at the bonnet.  
‘Do  you  want  a  hand  with  that?’  someone  called  out  in  an   Irish accent.  
I turned round and saw an old man on top of a houseboat fiddling with the stovepipe chimney.  
‘It’ll  be  all  right,’  I  said,  wandering  towards  him.  ‘What  I’d  really  like  a  hand  with  is  how  to  live  
on  one  of  these  boats.’  
Brendan Fowley straight ened up.  
‘Well  now,’  he  said.  ‘There’s  a  thing.’  
He took out a pipe and lit it, obviously delighted to have an excuse to stop work.  
‘You  should  go  along  to  that  boat  over  there,’  he  said.  ‘I’ve  just  sold  it  to  someone,  and  that  
young lady has moved in. Now  I  don’t  know,  but  there  are  two  bedrooms  and  she  might  be  looking  for  
a  lodger.  You’ll  have  to  go  through  a  little  wooden  gate  and  along  the  towpath.  She’s  the  last  boat  
before  the  bridge,  and  she’s  called   Alberta .’ 
I walked along the road, pushed open th e leaning wooden door and walked along the narrow 
towpath. At the last boat, I peered into a round porthole and saw a fair -haired girl bent over in the 
kitchen.  
‘Hello,’  I  said.  ‘You  must  be  Alberta.’  
‘Don’t  be  silly,’  she  said,  turning  round.  ‘That’s  the  name  of  the  boat.  I’m  called  Mundy.’  
‘Can  I  come  in?’  I  asked.  ‘My  car’s  just  broken  down  and  I’m  looking  for  somewhere  to  live.’  
Mundy was beautiful. Not only was she beautiful but she had just moved a bed on board. We sat 
down and had some lunch, and before we knew what we were doing we were lying on the bed making 
love. Her name was Mundy Ellis and I stayed the night with her that night, and moved my suitcase on board the next morning. She had a Labr ador called Friday, so with Mundy and Friday I had the week 
pretty well sewn up. We had the most romantic affair on Alberta , having dinner out on the roof in the 
summer nights, watching the ducks and other boats slip up and down the canal.  
Mundy and I live d together for almost a year. She helped out with the Student Advisory Centre, 
and then with the Manor. At that time nearly everyone was taking drugs, and soon Mundy had taken a 
couple of LSD trips up at the Manor with Tom Newman. She brought some LSD back  to London for 
me to try, and one evening we and two other friends, Rob and Caroline Gold, settled down on Alberta  
to  have  a  trip.  Rob  decided  that  he  wouldn’t  take  any  in  case  anything  went  wrong.  I  lived  by  the  
dangerous (and sometimes rather foolish) ma xim that I was prepared to try anything once, and I took 
the little paper square. After a while my mind began to race. At first everything was fine. We listened 
to some music and went outside to watch the evening sky. But when we went back inside everythin g 
started to go wrong: my vision began to tilt and Mundy loomed in and out looking like a tiny eight -
year-old child. I looked at the others smiling and chatting and laughing. But whenever I caught sight 
of Mundy all I saw was a wizened creature rather like  the red -coated dwarfish murderer in Don’t  Look  
Now. 
I hate being out of control, and I had no idea what to do. Although nearly everyone else at 
Student  and then later at Virgin took lots of drugs, I never really joined them. I prefer to have a great 
time and  keep  my  wits  about  me.  I  know  that  I’ve  got  to  get  up  early  the  next  morning  and  so  I’ve  
rarely been able to get smashed the night before. Utterly unused to this kind of thing and with the LSD 
charging  through  my  system,  I  couldn’t  think  straight.  I  fi nally went back outside and lay looking up 
at the sky. Mundy came out and hauled me into bed. When we started making love, I kept my eyes 
tightly closed, dreading what I would see if I opened them.  
By the time the LSD trip was over, it became clear that my  relationship with Mundy was also 
over. Even though she stopped looking like a murderous dwarf the next morning, I was never able to 
look at her in the same way again. Soon afterward Mundy left Alberta  and went up to the Manor to 
move in with Tom Newman.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5 Learning a lesson  
1971  
THROUGHOUT THE SPRING OF  1971, Virgin Mail Order attracted many more customers. But, 
although the company was growing, we were losing money. We offered large discounts on all records 
and, by the time we had spent money on the teleph one calls to order them, paid for the postage, and 
accounted  for  the  staff  and  the  shops,  we  weren’t  keeping  up.  Sometimes  our  customers  pretended  that  
they  hadn’t  received  the  records  so  we  would  have  to  send  out  a  second  copy,  and  often  a  third  and  a  
fourth and so on. All in all we were gradually losing money, and before long we were £15,000 
overdrawn.  
In the spring I received an order from Belgium for a large number of records. I went to the record 
companies that published those records and bought them w ithout paying the purchase tax which we 
had to pay on records sold in the UK. I then borrowed a van and drove down to Dover to take the ferry 
across to France and then drive on to Belgium. Some papers were stamped at Dover to confirm that so 
many records h ad been exported, but when I arrived at Calais I was asked for another document, a 
carnet  which  proved  I  wasn’t  going  to  sell  them  en  route  in  France.  The  British  and  the  French  
authorities both charged purchase tax on records, while Belgium charged nothin g, so the records in my 
van were effectively bonded stock. I did not have this carnet, and to my disappointment was forced to 
go back to Dover on the ferry, with the records still in my van.  
However, as I drove back to London, it dawned on me that I was no w carrying a vanload of 
records that had apparently been exported. I even had the customs stamp to prove it. The fact that the 
French customs had not allowed me through France was unknown. I had paid no purchase tax on these 
records, so I could sell them e ither by mail order or at the Virgin shop and make about £5,000 more 
profit than I could have done by the legal route. Two or three more trips like this and we would be out 
of debt.  
As well as the £15,000 debt of Virgin Records, I had taken on the £20,000 mortgage on the 
Manor, and the cost of converting the outbuildings into a recording studio. It seemed like the perfect 
way out. It was a criminal plan, and I was breaking the law. But I had always got away with breaking 
rules before. In those days I felt t hat  I  could  do  no  wrong  and  that,  even  if  I  did,  I  wouldn’t  be  caught.  
I  had  not  yet  reached  my  21st  birthday,  and  somehow  the  normal  everyday  rules  of  life  didn’t  seem  to  
apply. On top of all this exuberance, I was about to fall head over heels in love wi th a beautiful 
American girl called Kristen Tomassi.  
One  day  at  the  Manor  I  was  looking  for  Bootleg,  our  Irish  wolfhound.  I  couldn’t  find  her  
anywhere, and went upstairs and along one of the corridors, opening all the bedroom doors and calling 
out,  ‘Bootle g!  Bootleg!’  I  flung  open  the  door  of  one  tiny  bedroom  and  found  a  lovely,  tall  girl  getting  
changed. Not only was she considerably more attractive than Bootleg, with a rather quizzical, naughty 
face, but she was by herself and wearing just an old pair of skintight jeans and a black bra.  
‘You  look  great  just  as  you  are,’  I  said.  ‘I  wouldn’t  bother  with  any  more  clothes.’  
‘Whatever  are  you  shouting  out  about  bootlegs  for?’  she  asked.  ‘Bootleg’s  my  dog.  She’s  an  Irish  wolfhound.’  
Sadly, Kristen did put on a s hirt, but I managed to keep her chatting for almost an hour before 
someone started shouting for me. She had come to England for a summer holiday and met a musician 
who was doing some backing work at the Manor. She had come along with him for the ride.  
We d rove back to London in different cars. Kristen was with her musician boyfriend; I was by 
myself. As I followed her along the road I wondered if we would ever see each other again. I followed 
them all the way up to London, and finally decided to write a not e to her. As I drove along I scrawled 
a  note  on  a  scrap  of  paper  asking  her  to  call  me  at  seven  o’clock.  I  waited  until  we  reached  the  traffic  
lights  at  Acton,  then  jumped  out  of  my  car  and  ran  up  to  theirs.  I  tapped  on  Kristen’s  window  and  she  
rolled it d own. 
‘I  just  wanted  to  say  goodbye,’  I  said,  leaning  in  to  give  her  a  kiss  on  the  cheek.  ‘Have  a  good  trip  
back  to  the  States.’  
As I said this I secretly slipped my hand inside the car, reached down, and pushed my note into 
her  left  hand.  As  Kristen’s  fing ers closed round mine, I let go of the note. I smiled across at the 
boyfriend.  
‘Hope  the  recording  went  well,’  I  said  to  him.  
I hopped back into my car and drove back to Alberta . 
I  sat  by  the  telephone  refusing  to  make  any  calls,  which  was  most  unlike  me,  until  seven  o’clock.  
Then the phone rang. It was Kristen.  
‘I’m  calling  from  a  payphone,’  she  said.  ‘I  didn’t  want  John  to  overhear.’  
‘Can  you  step  out  of  the  phone  box  and  catch  a  taxi?’  I  asked.  ‘Come  on  round  and  see  me.  I  live  
on a boat called Alberta .  Ask  the  taxi  driver  to  take  you  to  Blomfield  Road  in  Little  Venice.  There’s  a  
little  wooden  door  in  the  fence  which  leads  to  the  towpath.’  
There was a measured pause.  
‘It  sounds  like   Alice in Wonderland ,’  Kristen  said.  ‘I’ll  see  you  in  ten  minutes.’  
And with that Kristen came round and I began my second whirlwind romance on Alberta . 
The next morning I was due to make what I hoped would be my final trip down to Dover, 
pretending to export records. By this time I had made three trips and £12,000 profit. This last trip 
would provide enough money to pay off our overdraft. I could then give up the scam and concentrate 
on the business. It is impossible to know whether we reall y would have stopped since making such 
easy money is addictive, but that was our intention. That morning I loaded up the van with records 
once again and set off for Dover. This time I was even more casual than normal and after my papers 
were stamped I didn ’t  even  bother  going  on  the  ferry  but  simply  drove  around  the  dock  and  headed  
back for London. I was anxious to get back to Alberta  to reassure myself that Kristen was still there. At Little Venice I walked along the towpath to the boat. It was the last we ek of May 1971, and the 
apple trees along the towpath were all in blossom.  
Kristen  had  gone.  In  a  panic  I  called  her  at  her  boyfriend’s  flat  and  put  on  an  American  accent  
when he answered the telephone.  
‘I’m  looking  for  a  Miss  Kristen  Tomassi,’  I  said.  ‘Th is  is  American  Airlines.’  
‘I’ll  just  get  her.’  
‘Kristen,’  I  hissed,  ‘it’s  Richard.  Pretend  you’re  talking  to  a  travel  agent.  And  then  call  me  back  
as  soon  as  you  can.  Go  to  a  payphone.’  
‘Thank  you  very  much.  I’ll  do  that,’  Kristen  said,  and  rang  off.  
Fifte en minutes later the telephone rang. It was Kristen.  
‘Just  hold  the  line  a  minute,’  I  told  her.  
‘OK,  Eddy,’  I  said,  holding  my  hand  over  the  receiver.  ‘Time  to  go.’  
Eddy was the Virgin driver who picked up all our record deliveries. He set off for the boyf riend’s  
flat. 
‘Kristen,’  I  said.  ‘What’s  your  number  there?  This  is  going  to  take  some  time.’  
I called her back, and we had a long chat about what we were doing. I spun every yarn I could 
think of. Twenty minutes later Eddy arrived back from the flat. He h ad  all  Kristen’s  clothes  in  a  
suitcase. He had told the boyfriend that Kristen was moving in with me.  
‘Kristen,’  I  said.  ‘You’d  better  come  round  here.  I’ve  got  something  to  show  you.  It  belongs  to  
you.’ 
I refused to reveal what it was. Her curiosity kindl ed, Kristen came round to Alberta . She was set 
upon saying goodbye to me and returning to America.  
When she arrived I held up her suitcase. She tried to grab it from me, but I opened it and threw 
her clothes all around the boat. Then I picked her up and ca rried her to the bedroom.  
While Kristen and I spent the rest of the day in bed, the Customs and Excise officials were 
planning  to  raid  Virgin.  It  had  never  occurred  to  me  that  I  wasn’t  the  only  person  who  had  stumbled  
across this tax -evasion scam. Many muc h larger record shops were doing it, and they were being much 
more sophisticated than I was. I was simply putting the records that should be exported in our Virgin 
Records shop on Oxford Street, and stocking up the new shop in Liverpool, which was due to o pen the 
next  week.  The  big  operators  were  distributing  their  illegally  ‘exported’  records  right  across  the  
country.  
The telephone rang at around midnight. The caller refused to give his name, but what he had to 
say was terrifying. He warned me that my bogu s trips to the Continent had been noticed and that I was about to be raided by the Customs and Excise office. He said that, if I bought an ultraviolet sun lamp 
from  a  chemist’s  shop  and  shone  it  on  the  records  that  I  had  bought  from  EMI,  I  would  notice  a  
fluorescent  ‘E’  stamped  on  the  vinyl  of  all  the  ones  that  were  meant  to  have  been  exported  to  Belgium.  
He told me that I would be raided first thing tomorrow morning. When I thanked him, he told me he 
was helping me because I had once stayed up late talking  to a suicidal friend of his who had called the 
Student Advisory Centre. I suspected that he was a customs officer.  
I called Nik and Tony and rushed out to buy two sun lamps from a late -night chemist on 
Westbourne Grove. We met at South Wharf Road and star ted pulling records out of their sleeves. The 
ghastly  truth  was  revealed:  an  ‘E’  shone  up  at  us  from  all  the  records  we  had  bought  from  EMI  for  
export. We began to run in and out of the warehouse carrying piles of records into the van. We then 
made a terri ble mistake: we assumed that the Customs and Excise officers would just raid the South 
Wharf warehouse. We therefore drove all the records round to the Oxford Street shop and put them in 
the racks to be sold. We had no idea that Customs and Excise officers  have greater powers of 
immediate search than the police. I had a similar attitude to when the Church Commissioners used to 
come to Albion Street: it was all some great game and I found it difficult to take very seriously. By the 
early hours of the morning  we  had  taken  all  the  ‘E’ -stamped records to the Oxford Street shop, and 
substituted some bona fide records for the warehouse stock.  
Kristen and I set off early the next morning and walked from Alberta  along the Grand Union 
Canal to South Wharf Road. I won dered when the raid would be. We crossed over the footbridge 
beside  St  Mary’s  Hospital  and  walked  along  the  path.  As  we  walked  by  the  hospital  there  was  a  
scream above us. A body fell out of the sky and hit the railings beside us. I caught a glimpse of an old 
man’s  grey,  unshaven  face  as  he  hit  the  railings.  It  was  horrific.  His  body  seemed  to  explode  and  a  
huge amount of entrails fell on to the ground or hung dripping in red and white shiny rings from the 
railing. He was naked apart from his white dressing  gown, which quickly began to soak up the blood. 
Kristen and I were too shocked to do anything other than stop and stare. He was clearly dead on 
impact. His neck hung off from his body and his back seemed to be broken in half. As we stared at the 
corpse, a  hospital nurse came running over from the side door. There was nothing she could do. 
Someone else came rushing out with a white sheet and covered the body and the bits in the street. 
Kristen and I stood there, enveloped by silence, until we became aware o f the noises of everyday life: 
traffic, horns blowing, and birdsong.  
‘Are  you  all  right?’  the  nurse  asked  us.  ‘Do  you  want  a  cup  of  tea?’  
We shook our heads and walked on, deeply shaken. It was another surreal twist to the start of our 
relationship. Two da ys ago we had met for the first time and I had slipped a clandestine note into her 
hand. We had enjoyed a fabulous night together on the boat. I had then driven to Dover and back, and 
arranged  for  her  suitcase  to  be  stolen.  I’d  spent  all  last  night  scrabbl ing about with the records. Now 
somebody had killed himself right in front of us. Like me, I think Kristen must have simply suspended 
her disbelief about what was going on. We were living off adrenaline and bewilderment.  
At the South Wharf Road warehouse, we unlocked the doors and walked upstairs. But before we 
could reach my office there was a knock on the door. I opened it to find seven or eight men in brown 
macs. ‘Are  you  Richard  Branson?’  they  said.  ‘We’re  Customs  and  Excise  and  we’ve  got  a  warrant  to  
inspect  your  stock.’  
These men were rather different from the two dowdy little accountants I had been expecting. 
They were bulky, tough men, and very threatening. Some of my cocksureness evaporated as I showed 
them into the warehouse.  
‘You’re  meant  to  have   gone  to  Belgium  yesterday,’  one  of  them  said.  ‘You  can’t  get  back  this  
quickly.’ 
I tried to laugh this off as I watched them begin to check all the records with their ultraviolet 
lamp.  They  grew  increasingly  worried  when  they  couldn’t  find  any  marked  recor ds. I enjoyed their 
confusion, trying to conceal my hope that we would get away with it. We began helping to check all 
the records, handing them the records from the sleeves and restocking them on the shelves.  
What  I  didn’t  realise  until  it  was  too  late  wa s that they were simultaneously busting our shops in 
Oxford Street and Liverpool, and finding hundreds of marked records.  
‘All  right.’  One  of  the  officers  put  down  the  telephone.  ‘They’ve  found  them.  You’d  better  come  
with  me.  I’m  arresting  you.  Come  down  to  Dover  with  us  and  make  a  statement.’  
I  couldn’t  believe  it.  I  had  always  thought  that  only  criminals  were  arrested:  it   hadn’t  occurred  to  
me  that  I  had  become  one.  I  had  been  stealing  money  from  Customs  and  Excise.  It  wasn’t  some  great  
game about my getting one up on the Customs and Excise office and getting off scot -free: I was 
guilty.  
At Dover I was charged under Section  301  of  the  Customs  and  Excise  Act  1952:  ‘That  on  28  
May  1971  at  Eastern  Docks,  Dover,  you  caused  to  be  delivered  to  an  officer  a  ship’s  manifest,  being  a  
document produced for the purpose of an assigned matter namely Customs, which was untrue in a 
materia l  particular  in  that  it  purported  to  show  the  exportation  of  10,000  gramophone  records  …’  
And so on. I spent that night in a cell lying on a bare, black plastic mattress with one old blanket. 
The  first  part  of  my  Stowe  headmaster’s  prediction  had  come  true : I was in prison.  
That night was one of the best things that has ever happened to me. As I lay in the cell and stared 
at the ceiling I felt complete claustrophobia. I have never enjoyed being accountable to anyone else or 
not being in control of my own de stiny. I have always enjoyed breaking the rules, whether they were 
school rules or accepted conventions, such as that no seventeen -year-old can edit a national magazine. 
As a twenty -year-old I had lived life entirely on my own terms, following my own insti ncts. But to be 
in prison meant that all that freedom was taken away.  
I was locked in a cell and utterly dependent on somebody else to open the door. I vowed to 
myself that I would never again do anything that would cause me to be imprisoned, or indeed do any 
kind of business deal by which I would ever have cause to be embarrassed.  
In the many different business worlds I have inhabited since that night in prison, there have been 
times when I could have succumbed to some form of bribe, or could have had my w ay by offering 
one. But ever since that night in Dover prison I have never been tempted to break my vow. My parents had always drummed into me that all you have in life is your reputation: you may be very rich, but if 
you  lose  your  good  name  you’ll  never  b e happy. The thought will always lurk at the back of your 
mind  that  people  don’t  trust  you.  I  had  never  really  focused  on  what  a  good  name  truly  meant  before,  
but that night in prison made me understand.  
The next morning Mum arrived to meet me at the court . I applied for legal aid since I had no 
money to pay for a lawyer. The magistrate told me that if I applied for legal aid I would have to stay in 
prison as I obviously had no money for bail. If I wanted to be released, I would have to put up bail of 
£30,0 00. Virgin itself had no money that we could put up as security. £30,000 was the price of the 
Manor,  but  using  it  as  security  wasn’t  an  option  since  it  was  financed  mainly  by  a  mortgage.  I  had  a  
pile of debt and no real money.  
Mum told the magistrate that she would put up Tanyards Farm, her home, as security. I was 
overwhelmed by the trust she showed in me. We stared at each other across the court and both started 
crying. The trust that my family had in me had to be repaid.  
‘You don’t  have  to  apologise,  Ricky,’  Mum  said  as  we  took  the  train  back  up  to  London.  ‘I  know  
that  you’ve  learnt  a  lesson.  Don’t  cry  over  spilt  milk:  we’ve  got  to  get  on  and  deal  with  this  head  on.’  
Over the summer I confronted the problem with far less shame  than I would have done if my 
parents  had  added  to  the  burden.  I  kept  a  clear  head;;  I  was  sorry;;  I  wouldn’t  do  it  again;;  and  I  
negotiated an out -of-court settlement with the Customs and Excise office. The tax authorities in the 
UK are more interested in ex tracting money than going through expensive court cases.  
On 18 August 1971 I agreed to pay £15,000 as an immediate payment, with £45,000 to be paid in 
three instalments over the next three years. The total was calculated as being three times the illegal 
profit which Virgin had made from avoiding the purchase tax. If I paid off the sums agreed, I would 
avoid a criminal record. But, if I failed to pay it, I would be rearrested and tried.  
After that night in prison and the subsequent negotiations with the Cust oms and Excise office, I 
needed to work twice as hard to make Virgin a success. Nik, Tony Mellor, and my South African 
cousin Simon Draper and Chris Stylianou, who had both just joined Virgin, resolved to help keep me 
out of prison. They knew it could have  been them and were grateful to me for carrying the can: we 
were all in it together and it made us even closer. In a desperate attempt to earn money to repay the 
settlement, Nik started opening Virgin Records shops across the country; Simon began to talk a bout a 
record label and Chris started exporting records for real. Incentives come in all shapes and sizes – 
usually ranging from a pat on the back to share options – but avoiding prison was the most persuasive 
incentive  I’ve  ever  had.  
Since there was limit ed growth left in the mail -order business, we concentrated on expanding the 
record shops. The next two years were a crash course in how to manage cash. From being a 
completely relaxed company running on petty cash from the biscuit tin and a series of unpai d IOU 
notes, we became obsessively focused. We used every penny of the cash generated from the shops 
towards opening up another shop, which in turn was another pound towards paying off my Customs 
and Excise debt.  
Eventually I was able to pay everything and  relieve Mum of the bail she had put up. Three years 
later I was also able to repay Auntie Joyce her £7,500, with £1,000 on top for interest. If I had been unable to pay off Customs and Excise, the rest of my life could have been ruined: it is unlikely, no t to 
say impossible, that someone with a criminal record would have been allowed to set up an airline, or 
would have been taken seriously as a contender to run the National Lottery.  
We knew we had to sell more records, through the shops, overseas and by ma il order; attract 
important artists like Cat Stevens or Paul McCartney to come and record at the Manor, and set up a 
record  label.  What  we  didn’t  know  was  that,  even  as  we  set  out  to  do  this,  our  first  fortune  was  quietly  
making its way up the gravelled dr ive to the Manor in the form of another van. This time it was not 
carrying illegal records but bringing a young composer and his folk -singing sister from London to act 
as backing musicians for a band. He was the third reserve guitarist on the musical Hair , and she was a 
folk singer who sang in pubs. At the back of their minds was the hope that they might be able to 
record  some  esoteric  instrumental  music  when  the  rest  of  the  band  wasn’t  using  the  studio.  Their  
names were Mike and Sally Oldfield.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6 ‘Simon  ma de  Virgin  the  hippest  place  to  be.’  
1971 –1972  
BEFORE THE POSTAL STRIKE  nearly ruined us in January 1971, someone my age with a South 
African accent walked into my office at South Wharf Road and introduced himself as my cousin. 
Simon Draper had graduated fr om Natal University and come over to London with just £100 and the 
idea of staying for a while. He was thinking of doing a postgraduate degree, perhaps following his 
brother, who had been a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, but in the meantime he was looking for a  job. 
Simon had sat next to my mother at a family dinner party over Christmas and she had told him to 
get in touch with me. After Simon had exhausted the hospitality of both sides of his family over 
Christmas and New Year, he moved into a flat in London an d tracked down the Virgin Records shop 
in  Oxford  Street.  Sandy  O’Connell,  the  manager,  told  him  to  go  over  and  see  me  at  South  Wharf  
Road. He arrived just before lunch.  
We went off to have something to eat at the Greek restaurant round the corner in Praed Street. 
There, over lukewarm meatballs, chips and peas, Simon explained what he wanted to do. While he had 
been at Natal University he had also worked on the South African Sunday Times . He told me stories of 
sitting up through Saturday night until the firs t edition was ready, and then leaving work to go to a 
jazz club with the first edition tucked under his arm. We swapped stories about journalism and then 
moved on to music.  
Simon was obsessed by music. Because I had left school so young, and had never been  to 
university, I had missed out on those long evenings spent lying around listening to music. Even though 
music was playing constantly in the Student  basement, I was too busy calling up advertisers and 
negotiating with printers to absorb it. If I heard a record, I knew whether I liked it or not, but I 
couldn’t  compare  it  with  some  other  band  or  recognise  that  it  had  been  influenced  by  the  Velvet  
Underground. It seemed to me that Simon had listened to every record released by every band. He 
didn’t  just  casu ally enjoy the latest Doors album: he thoroughly understood what they were doing, 
how they had developed from their previous album and how this album compared with a whole 
catalogue of music. He had hosted his own half -hour show on Natal Radio, and I soon realised that he 
knew  more  about  music  than  anyone  I’d  ever  met.  
We also talked about politics. Although I had been involved in various political demonstrations, 
such as the anti -Vietnam War march to Grosvenor Square, this was nothing compared with the 
brutality of South African politics. Simon was steeped in both music and politics, and saw music as 
one  way  to  make  a  political  protest.  One  of  Simon’s  fellow  students  at  Natal  University  had  been  
Steve Biko, who was then leading the all -black South African S tudents  Organisation.  Simon’s  tutor,  a  
Marxist, had been shot by government -backed vigilantes in front of his own children. The South 
African Government then did not tolerate any form of political dissent. Simon was not allowed to play 
any song with politi cal or sexual connotations, such as those by Jimi Hendrix or Bob Dylan.  
By the time we were on our coffee I had persuaded Simon to come and work at Virgin, to be the 
record buyer for the Virgin Records shop and the Virgin mail -order list. There was no awkw ard salary 
negotiation since everyone at Virgin was paid the same, £20 per week.  Tony Mellor had moved from working on Student  to compiling the mail -order list. We were still 
trying to sell Student  to another magazine company, and although it had not been published for over a 
year Tony kept producing dummies of the next issue with which we tried to impress potential buyers. 
He was therefore happy to hand the record buying to Simon and revert to the more political question 
of Student ’s  future.  Tony  simply  ga ve  Simon  the  one  golden,  unbreakable  rule,  ‘Virgin  doesn’t  ever,  
ever  stock  Andy  Williams!’,  and  handed  over  the  first  joint  of  the  morning.  
‘You  don’t  need  to  worry,’  Simon  said.  ‘I’d  be  the  last  person  to  break  that  one.’  
And from then on Simon was on hi s own. I rather left him to it for the first few months. I was 
falling in love with Kristen and trying to prevent her going back to finish her architectural course in 
America. I offered her the job of further renovating the Manor:  
‘Come  on!’  I  said.  ‘You  don’t  have  to  study  for  six  years  to  qualify  as  an  architect.  Just  start  
doing  it!’ 
After not too much persuading she eventually agreed with me and set to work. She was a natural, 
with perfect taste. With her long blonde hair and fi ne, almost elfin face, Kristen soon became a 
familiar figure at all the auction rooms around London as she bid for large remarkable pieces of 
furniture for the Manor.  
While Nik managed the costs of both the mail -order business and the Virgin Records shops,  
Simon began to define the mail -order list as well as the Virgin Records shops themselves by choosing 
which  records  to  stock.  Simon’s  taste  in  music  quickly  became  the  single  most  critical  element  of  the  
Virgin ethos. A record shop is not just a record sho p: it is an arbiter of taste. I had no idea what music 
to promote, but Simon was full of wonderful plans to bring in unknown foreign albums unavailable 
elsewhere.  There  was  a  thin  dividing  line  between  what  was  ‘hip’  and  what  wasn’t,  and  Simon  made  
Virgin the  ‘hippest’  place  to  be.  He  started  importing  records  directly  from  America,  flying  them  in  to  
beat the competition. We only ever dealt in albums because singles were mainly either crass or were 
loss leaders to promote albums. In the 1970s serious bands such as Pink Floyd, Yes or Genesis rarely 
released singles. An album was seen as a combination of political statement, art, and a way of life. The 
serious  bands  didn’t  produce  dance  music:  theirs  was  music  to  savour  while  lying  down.  There  was  a  
good deal of discussion about different recordings of the same songs, something which became 
especially interesting when the American albums arrived with different covers from the British 
versions, sometimes even different versions of the songs. These days CDs have been standardised to 
be mass marketed around the world.  
As well as imports, notably from Germany, France and America, and a furtive trade in live 
bootleg recordings, we also made a lot of money by dealing in deletions – recordings which had gone 
out of sto ck and were being sold off by the record company. Since we operated a mail -order business, 
we had hundreds of letters every day asking for special recordings. We thus knew which of these 
deletions actually had some residual demand, and it was quite simple for us to pick up the popular 
ones cheaply and sell them on.  
Most  people  assume  that  a  record  shop’s  success  lies  in  selling  records.  In  fact,  Virgin’s  success  
both  in  mail  order  and  the  record  shops  lay  in  Simon’s  skill  at  buying  records.  He  was  able  to  p ick out 
bands that did not sell through the mainstream shops and sell large numbers of them through Virgin. He knew so much about music that he knew which bands would sell even before they were a proven 
success: he was already using the antennae which enab led us to set up the record label two years later. 
Without Simon, such a move would have been a step in the dark. Our other genius was John Varnom, 
who did all the promotion for the records and wrote the advertising slogans for the shops. Virgin 
began to g ain a broader reputation.  
With the best music playing in the shops and the warehouse all day, both the staff and the 
customers lying around smoking dope and talking about how to get hold of the highly prized 
American recording of Aerosol Grey Machine  by Va n Der Graaf Generator, and everyone enjoying 
plenty of sex, there was no better place for any self -respecting 21 -year-old to be.  
But beneath that there was a business to run. At the Manor, building work dragged on. I dreaded every 
call from Tom Newman, who  was fitting all the equipment: he always asked for more money to buy 
some other piece of recording equipment. At the same time I had the customs fine, the mortgage and 
the thought of prison hanging over me.  
The mail -order business was doing well but mainl y seemed to attract the serious music buyers 
who were looking for quite rare records. It seemed difficult to expand it further. We realised that, if 
we were going to make money, it would have to come from opening up more Virgin Records shops.  
Nik and I beg an a programme of serious expansion. Towards the end of 1971 and throughout 
1972 we aimed to open a shop every month. By Christmas 1972 we had fourteen record shops: several 
in London and one in every big city across the country. As well as organising all the records that the 
shops would stock, advertising the shops, choosing and training the staff to run them, and setting up 
the accounting systems to keep control of the money, we found that the timing of shop openings was 
crucial. After negotiating the lea se until we were sure that the landlord would go no lower, we would 
push for a rent -free period for the first three months. This was the single most crucial element. We 
would not agree to open the shop unless this was in place, and as a result we walked aw ay from a great 
many opportunities. However, when we opened we knew that the record sales in the first three months 
would help pay for the rent on the previous shop that we had opened. The sales also demonstrated, 
without committing to a huge overhead, whe ther the site we had chosen attracted enough people off 
the streets to make the shop viable.  
As we opened these shops we learnt all sorts of lessons that stood us in good stead for the future. 
We always looked for the cheaper end of the high street, where we might attract shoppers to come a 
few extra yards off the beaten track without us having to pay an exorbitant rent. We also chose areas 
where the teenagers hung out, such as near the Clock Tower in Brighton or Bold Street in Liverpool. 
We always asked th e local teenagers where the best place for a record shop would be. There are many 
invisible lines in a town which people will not cross: a street can change character in the space of 
twenty yards.  
The other unique thing about record retailing is the speed with which records move. When a big 
release is out, like the latest David Bowie record, you can measure its sales in hours. You therefore 
need  to  keep  right  on  top  of  the  shop  to  find  out  what’s  selling  that  day.  You  can  then  use  that  
information to rearra nge  the  record  displays  in  the  other  shops.  If  you  run  out  of  the  key  record  that’s  
selling  that  day,  then,  of  course,  the  buyer  will  head  off  to  the  next  shop  to  pick  it  up.  Once  you’ve  lost  
that chance to sell a copy of Hunky Dory , you never get it back again. There are no repeat sales of the same record. Although you will always stock Hunky Dory , up to 70 per cent of your sales of it will 
happen in the first two weeks of its release.  
At first, Virgin promoted its image as a place where people could come and spend time listening 
to  and  choosing  their  records,  with  a  distinct  emphasis  on  elitist,  ‘hip’  taste.  As  well  as  the  more  
mainstream records, we wanted to show teenagers more interesting ones. Our shops flatly refused to 
sell the mass -market teeny -bopp er records such as the ones by The Osmonds and The Sweet that were 
storming  the  charts.  Despite  Simon’s  persuasive  arguments  about  style,  our  refusal  to  stock  Gary  
Glitter and all the glam -rock stars always slightly worried me since I could see the short -term income 
we were turning away. However, Simon assured me that if we stuck to our image we would keep our 
integrity  and  build  up  more  customers:  ‘It’s  the  Andy  Williams  rule,’  he  told  me.  ‘We’re  not  in  that  
market.’ 
The shop at 130 Notting Hill Gate became one of the best Virgin Records shops. Simon started 
working above it, and we laid our cushions on the floor in the shop so that people could lie around 
there all day. We knew that we were successful when people star ted coming up to London just to go to 
a Virgin Records shop. If we could have sold marijuana, we would have done. In fact, I suspect that 
some of the staff did. Selling records, chatting up the customers, recommending which music to buy, 
reaching under the  counter for the latest bootleg, heading off to pubs and clubs to hear more bands 
play: it became a way of life.  
When we opened our Virgin Records shop in Bold Street, Liverpool, in March 1972, I proudly 
saw that we took £10,000 in the first week. A week l ater the figure was £7,000, and then the following 
week the takings were down to £3,000. By the middle of the summer they had dropped to £2,000 and I 
went up there to see what was going wrong. The shop was packed. There were rockers all jammed into 
one cor ner, mods in another, and hippies draped all over the floor near the till. All kinds of music were 
playing. But nobody was buying anything. Everyone was happily stoned and having a great time, but 
nobody could get to the till and they were keeping other sh oppers out of the store. The policy of 
treating our shops like clubs was out of control. For the next month we had someone at the door who 
gently warned people as they went in that they were going into a shop, not a nightclub; we put in 
brighter lights and  moved the counter and the till nearer the window. It was a narrow line between 
maintaining  the  shop’s  atmosphere  and  keeping  it  profitable.  The  takings  at  last  recovered.  
Throughout this expansion, one of our main difficulties was getting hold of the reco rds to sell. 
Some record companies, including PolyGram, refused to supply us because we were discounting and 
therefore offending the main retailers. Other record companies refused to supply us since they doubted 
our ability to pay. Nik and Chris Stylianou (‘Chris  the  Greek’,  who  had  joined  as  our  sales  manager)  
called around all the possible suppliers, and eventually found an extraordinary solution: a record shop 
in South Woodford called Pop In, run by Raymond Laren. Raymond was prepared to use his account 
to buy records on our behalf. It was good business for him since he would order all our records on top 
of his own orders, charge a 5 per cent margin and pass them on to us.  
When we first struck this deal with Raymond, we would give him the list of records to add on to 
his  orders;;  Tony  or  Simon  would  drive  round  and  pick  them  up,  and  we’d  drive  them  to  the  three  or  
four Virgin shops. Pop In was a tiny shop with matt black walls and peeling posters of Sergeant 
Pepper  and Neil Young. It was difficult to squeez e in and out with the boxes of records, but we 
managed to cope. Over the next year, as we opened more and more shops, the number of records passing  through  Raymond’s  shop  grew.  Soon  Raymond  was  ordering  thousands  of  records  from  the  
record labels and we we re sending a lorry to collect them.  
We kept trying to deal with the record labels directly, but they continued to ignore us. Soon 
Virgin  became  one  of  the  largest  record  chains  in  the  country  and  the  scenes  at  Raymond’s  shop  were  
farcical: a line of vans u nloaded hundreds of cases of records at the front door, and people staggered 
through the shop to the back door, where they were loaded on to another line of vans to take them 
around the Virgin shops. Something had to give. We were still having to pay an ex tra 5 per cent to buy 
our records through Raymond. Finally, Nik and I went back to the record labels and pointed out what 
was  happening.  They  agreed  to  sell  records  to  us  directly,  and  Raymond  Laren’s  Ealing -comedy 
earner was over. His shop reverted to sel ling a few dozen records each week, and his accountants were 
left to puzzle over what had gone wrong with his amazing shop.  
During 1972 Simon fell in love with a South American girl and told me that he was going to 
leave Virgin and go to live in Chile with  her. The Manor was at last open for artists to record; there 
were twenty Virgin Records shops, and the mail -order business was doing well. Simon had been 
working with me for a year and, although neither of us had ever expected him to stay for more than a 
few months, I suddenly realised how vital he was to Virgin. His choice in music had established the 
Virgin Records shops as the place  to  go  and  buy  records.  It  was  ‘hip’  to  go  and  spend  an  afternoon  
mooching around the Virgin Records shop, whereas no self -respecting teenager would go and spend 
an afternoon hanging around Woolies.  
The credibility which Simon had always talked about, and the sales of The Osmonds which we 
had foregone, had worked. The music press now discussed which artists Virgin was promotin g. When 
we put an eclectic German band called Tangerine Dream in our shop windows, it became a talking 
point. Record labels started contacting us and asking whether the Virgin Records shops could run 
special promotions on their bands.  
I tried to persuade S imon to stay, but he was set on leaving. His girlfriend went to Chile first, 
with  Simon  poised  to  join  her  in  a  month’s  time.  During  that  month  he  suddenly  received  the  ‘Dear  
Simon’  letter  from  her  which  called  everything  off.  He  was  desperately  disappoint ed, but at the same 
time it became clear that his future lay in London rather than either South America or even South 
Africa. Since Virgin now had the record shops and the recording studio, we started talking about the 
third part of the grandiose dream we had discussed over our first lunch at the Greek restaurant: the 
Virgin record label.  
If Virgin set up a record label, we could offer artists somewhere to record (for which we could 
charge them); we could publish and release their records (from which we cou ld make profit), and we 
had a large and growing chain of shops where we could promote and sell their records (and make the 
retail profit margin). The three businesses were mutually compatible and would also benefit the bands 
we signed, since we could reduc e prices at the Manor, the manufacturing end, and increase promotion 
at the shops, the retail end, while still making our own profit.  
Simon and I drew up an agreement whereby he would set up and run the new Virgin record label, 
Virgin Music. He would own 2 0 per cent of the company, which would henceforth be separate from 
the Virgin Records shops. And the first person Simon and I wanted to sign up was that third reserve 
guitarist from Hair : Mike Oldfield.  Mike Oldfield had had a difficult childhood with an a lcoholic mother. He had often locked himself up 
in his room in the attic and taught himself how to play all kinds of instruments. At the age of fourteen 
he had made his first recording with his sister Sally, singing folk music. He and his sister formed a 
folk duo called Sallyangie and signed to Transatlantic Records. By fifteen he had left home and 
become  a  guitarist  alongside  Dave  Bedford  with  Kevin  Ayers’  group  The  Whole  World.  
For a couple of weeks in October 1971, Mike was signed as a session guitarist to a singer called 
Arthur Louis who was recording at the Manor. Mike soon started chatting to Tom Newman and one 
day finally screwed up the courage and gave him a tape of his own music. Mike had recorded this tape 
himself, laboriously overdubbing many diff erent instruments on to the same tape. It lasted eighteen 
minutes,  was  untitled  and  had  no  vocals.  Tom  listened  to  it  and  described  it  as  ‘hyper -romantic, sad, 
poignant  and  brilliant’.  Tom  then  played  it  to  Simon  when  he  was  next  up  at  the  Manor.  Simon  was  
astonished by it. He tried to help Mike approach some record companies, but they all turned him 
down.  
A year later, Simon and I were sitting on the houseboat when we finally decided to start a record 
company. We called Mike up. To our delight he had still  not signed up with anyone. He felt 
completely rejected by the record industry and was overwhelmed that we seriously wanted to release 
his music. He came straight over to the houseboat to see us. I suggested that Mike should go back to 
the Manor and live t here, and then whenever the recording studio was free he and Tom Newman could 
get together and work on his record.  
‘I’ll  need  to  rent  some  instruments,  though,’  Mike  warned  me.  
‘Like  what?’  I  pulled  out  my  diary  and  prepared  a  list.  
‘A  good  acoustic  guitar , a Spanish guitar, a Farfisa organ, a Fender precision bass, a good Fender 
amplifier, glockenspiel, a mandolin, a mellotron –’ 
‘What’s  that?’  I  drew  a  circle  round  it.  
‘It’s  not  absolutely  necessary,’  Mike  conceded.  ‘A  triangle,  a  Gibson  guitar  …  Oh,  and  some  
chimes,  of  course.’  
‘What  are  chimes?’  I  asked.  
‘Tubular  bells.’  
I  wrote  down  ‘tubular  bells’  and  set  about  finding  all  these  instruments  in  a  music  magazine.  The  
guitar cost £35, the Spanish guitar £25, the Fender amplifier £45, the mandolin £15, and the triangle 
was a bargain at £1. The tubular bells cost £20.  
‘£20  for  tubular  bells?’  I  said.  ‘They’d  better  be  worth  it.’  
 
 7 ‘It’s  called   Tubular Bells .  I’ve  never  hea rd  anything  like  it.’  
1972 –1973  
SINCE MIKE OLDFIELD WAS  the first artist we signed, we had no idea what sort of a contract to 
offer him. Luckily, Sandy Denny, who originally sang with Fairport Convention but had now gone 
solo, had recently recorded at the Manor. She had become a friend of mine and I asked her for a copy 
of her contract with Island Records. This was apparently a standard Island Records deal, and we 
retyped  it  word  for  word,  changing  ‘Island  Records’  to  ‘Virgin  Music’  and  ‘Sandy  Denny’  to  ‘Mi ke 
Oldfield’.  It  set  out  that  Mike  would  make  ten  albums  for  Virgin  Music  and  receive  a  5  per  cent  
royalty on 90 per cent of the wholesale value of the record (10 per cent was kept by the record 
company to pay for packaging costs and breakages). Since Mike  had no money, we put him on the 
standard Virgin salary which we all received, £20 a week. We would then deduct it from any future 
royalties,  if  they  ever  materialised.  Although  Simon  and  I  loved  Mike’s  music,  we  never  thought  that  
we’d  make  any  money  from  it. 
It took Mike well into 1973 to record what became known as Tubular Bells . It was a fantastically 
complicated sequence of recordings to make, and he and Tom Newman went over it again and again 
in the recording studio, mixing, dubbing, and fine -tuning a ll the different layers of music. Mike played 
over twenty different instruments and made over 2,300 different recordings until he was happy. In the 
meantime we were still trying to rent out the Manor to any band we could find, so Mike was often 
interrupted  and had to clear his kit out of the recording studio to make way for The Rolling Stones or 
Adam Faith.  
Frank Zappa had made his reputation as one of the most original, innovative and irreverent 
performers in rock music. His albums, like We’re  Only  In  It  F or The Money  and Weasels Ripped My 
Flesh , were filled with biting satire, and when he came up to the Manor to investigate the possibilities 
of recording there I felt sure he would appreciate a joke.  
I drove Frank up from London myself, enthusing about the wonderful manor house in which the 
studio was situated. But, instead of taking the road to Shipton -on-Cherwell, I made a detour to nearby 
Woodstock. I turned off the road, under a majestic arch, and drove down a long, gravel driveway to 
the door of a magni ficent house.  
‘I’ll  park  the  car,’  I  told  Frank.  ‘Just  knock  on  the  door  and  tell  them  who  you  are.’  
The  door  was  opened  by  a  uniformed  footman.  Funnily  enough,  he  didn’t  recognise  Frank  Zappa  
and was not amused to be told the long -haired musician had come  to stay. Did Zappa know, the 
footman asked, that he was knocking at the door of Blenheim Palace, the ancestral seat of the Dukes 
of Marlborough?  
Frank got back into the car, swearing that he could see the funny side of it. But he never did 
record at the M anor. 
On 22 July 1972, Kristen and I were married at the tiny church at Shipton -on-Cherwell. I had just 
turned 22, and Kristen was still 20. We had known each other only since May of the previous year. I 
still have a copy of the invitation we sent out for the  party  before  the  wedding.  It  reads:  ‘Kristen  and  I  have decided to get married, and we thought that this would be a good excuse for a party. There will 
be  a  pig  on  a  spit,  so  please  come  since  the  pig  will  not  last.  The  Scaffold  will  be  playing.’  One  o f the 
best things about the Manor was that it lent itself to having wonderful parties. We had bands who were 
happy to play, a river to swim in, huge rooms with ancient fireplaces, and a cloistered courtyard which 
caught the sun.  
Our wedding barbecue was a great feast, with all the villagers from Shipton -on-Cherwell mixing 
with the Virgin staff and a great many of the rock bands around at the time. The wedding day was 
extraordinary throughout. As we were waiting at the church for K risten to arrive, a huge articulated 
lorry started to squeeze its way down the narrow lane towards us. Nobody could understand what it 
was doing, until a tiny old lady in a blue suit with a blue hat jammed on to her head climbed out.  
‘I’m  not  too  late,  am   I?’  Granny  called  out.  
The lorry had crashed into her car coming through Oxford, and she had insisted that the driver 
take her to our wedding.  
My parents gave us a beautiful old Bentley with red leather seats and a walnut dashboard as a 
wedding present. Al though it tended to break down as much as my Morris Minor, it was supremely 
comfortable to sit in while we were towed along.  
One  of  Kristen’s  bridesmaids  was  her  sister  Meryll,  and  Nik  was  my  best  man.  At  the  reception  
afterward it became clear that there was a certain chemistry between them, and late that night they 
headed off towards a room in the Manor. By the time Kristen and I returned from honeymoon, Nik 
and Meryll had announced that they too were getting married.  
Nik and Meryll were married even fast er than Kristen and I: their wedding was in the winter of 
1972, just five months after they had met. Kristen and I found this marriage a little claustrophobic: I 
would spend all day with Nik at South Wharf Road, and then I would also see him and Meryll tog ether 
in the evenings. Unfortunately, one of the reasons why Kristen had come to England was to escape 
from her family, and now she found that she and her sister had married two men who practically lived 
in  each  other’s  pocket.  Incestuous  wasn’t  the  word  f or it. On top of that, Nik and I, who had run 
Virgin very much as a singles company, suddenly found ourselves both married: it was something of a 
culture shock.  
Throughout the winter of 1972 and the spring of 1973, Mike Oldfield was living at the Manor 
and recording Tubular Bells . I think this was the happiest time of his life. He was there with Tom 
Newman, who was obsessed by the technology of recording, and they could endlessly refine the 
recordings together. Mundy was still living there. When Kristen and  I drove up to the Manor on a 
Friday night, we would find Mike, Tom and Mundy sitting on cushions on the floor, stoking up the 
vast fire and listening to the latest tapes. They were oblivious to the outside world. Tubular Bells  was 
finally ready for releas e in May 1973.  
We knew that we had something extraordinary on our hands when we started selling Tubular 
Bells  into the trade. Simon took the recording along to the sales conference at Island Records, who 
were going to distribute the album. They were all in  a large conference room at a hotel near 
Birmingham. They had already had to listen to hours of music. These men had heard it all before – 
literally. Simon put on Tubular Bells  and they listened to the first side in its entirety. When it finished there was  an  outburst  of  applause.  This  was  Simon’s  first  sales  conference  and  so  he  had  no  idea  that  it  
was unprecedented. He never again heard a roomful of world -weary salesmen applauding a new 
record.  
On 25 May 1973 Virgin Music released its first four albums: M ike  Oldfield’s   Tubular Bells ; Flying 
Teapot  by Gong; Manor Live , a jam session from the Manor led by Elkie Brooks; and The Faust 
Tapes  by Faust, a German band.  
1973 was an extraordinary year for rock and pop music. That summer saw the singles chart 
dominat ed by the glam rock of Suzi Quatro, Wizzard, Gary Glitter, and The Sweet. But there was also 
a large Motown contingent, with Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Jackson Five and 
Barry White. At the other end of the spectrum from these singers we re  Lou  Reed  with  ‘Take  A  Walk  
On  The  Wild  Side’  and  10cc  with  ‘Rubber  Bullets’.  
The album charts were headed by David Bowie at number one with Aladdin Sane , the first proof 
of how he could reinvent himself to stay at the top. Below him were The Beatles wit h their 1962 –1966  
and 1967 –1970  double albums, Pink Floyd with Dark Side Of The Moon ,  Lou  Reed’s   Transformer , 
and  Roxy  Music’s   For Your Pleasure . 
In  the  face  of  this  competition,  we  had  to  fight  hard  to  attract  attention  for  Virgin’s  first  four  
releases. B ut it was Tubular Bells  that  really  captured  people’s  imagination:  it  was  completely  original  
and immediately spellbinding. People found it addictive and played it again and again, both to listen to 
the music and to marvel at how Mike had woven it all toge ther. I remember a review in NME  that I 
had to reread several times before I realised that, although I would never understand what the critic 
was actually saying, he was clearly raving about it. NME  was the single most influential music paper. 
With it prai sing Tubular Bells , everyone would look out for it.  
Aside from the reviews, I knew that, as soon as we could get people to listen to Tubular Bells  
once,  it  would  take  off.  As  one  critic  correctly  said,  ‘One  hearing  should  provide  sufficient  proof.’  The  
problem was getting that hearing. I called up every radio producer I could, trying to persuade them to 
play Tubular Bells . But at that time 3 -minute s ingles dominated radio music: there was no room for a 
45-minute  piece  of  music  without  words.  Radio  3  turned  it  down  because  it  wasn’t  Mozart  and  Radio  
1  turned  it  down  because  it  wasn’t  Gary  Glitter.  
For the first two weeks, sales of Tubular Bells  were st illborn. Then I invited John Peel over to 
Alberta  for lunch. We had known each other since I had interviewed him for Student . He had also 
started his own record label, Dandelion. He was the only person who played serious rock music on the 
radio, and his sh ow was our only chance of winning air time for Tubular Bells . We all had lunch on 
Alberta  and then settled down on the sofas. I put on Tubular Bells . He was amazed.  
‘I’ve  never  heard  anything  like  it,’  John  finally  said.  
Later that week we listened to John  Peel’s  laconic  voice  coming  out  of  the  radio.  I  was  sitting  on  
the deck of the houseboat with Mike Oldfield and everyone from Virgin.  
‘Tonight  I’m  not  going  to  play  a  whole  lot  of  records.  I’m  just  going  to  play  you  one  by  a  young  
composer called Mike Old field.  It’s  his  first  record  and  it’s  called   Tubular Bells .  I’ve  never  heard  anything  like  it  in  my  life.  It’s  released  by  Virgin,  a  brand -new record label, and it was recorded at 
Virgin’s  own  studios  in  Oxfordshire.  You’ll  never  forget  this.’  
With that, Tubular Bells  started. I was lying on the sofa. Everyone was lounging around in deep 
armchairs or on the rug, and we passed round beer and wine, cigarettes and joints. I tried to relax. I 
could see everyone else lying there totally spellbound by the music. But I kept worrying. I find it 
impossible to stop my brain from churning through all the ideas and possibilities facing me at any 
given moment. I wondered how many people were listening to The John Peel Show ; how many of 
those would go out and buy Tubular Bells  the next day; whether they would wait until Saturday or 
would  have  forgotten  about  it  by  then.  Would  they  come  to  the  Virgin  shops  or  order  it  from  Smith’s?  
How fast would we receive the royalties? How many copies would we have to reprint? How should 
we br eak  it  in  America?  On  one  level  I  was  absorbed  in  the  music,  but  I  felt  like  an  outsider.  I  couldn’t  
lose myself in it like Simon or Nik, or my lovely new assistant Penni, who was a real beauty with 
long, black wavy hair and a generous smile. I was too awa re that Virgin needed to sell a lot of copies 
to  make  money  for  next  month’s  tax  repayment.  I  knew  that   Flying Teapot  and The Faust Tapes  were 
hardly going to knock The Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan off the charts. But Tubular Bells  was 
extraordinary: someth ing  must  happen  from  tonight’s  broadcast.  Virgin  would  never  be  able  to  afford  
to buy such a length of radio time to advertise it.  
Mike Oldfield sat in silence. He leant against Penni and stared straight at the radio. I wondered 
what was going through his head. I had wedged a sleeve of Tubular Bells  – which showed a giant 
tubular bell suspended over the sea with a wave breaking in the foreground – above one of the picture 
frames. Mike stared at it as if he was staring out to sea. A greedy thought swam in th e murky depths of 
my mind: perhaps he was already dreaming up another album?  
All the next day the phones rang with orders from record shops for Tubular Bells . As well as 
choosing to break all tradition by playing it in its entirety, John Peel reviewed Tubu lar Bells  for the 
Listener : 
On  the  all  too  frequent  occasions  when  I’m  told  that  a  record  by  a  contemporary  rock  musician  is  
a  work  of  ‘lasting  importance’  I  tend  to  reach  for  my  hat  and  head  for  the  wide  open  spaces.  
Today these experts would probably t ell  you  that  in  twenty  years’  time  collectors  will  still  be  
enthusing  over  the  records  of  such  weighty  bands  as  Yes  and  Emerson,  Lake  and  Palmer.  I’m  
ready to bet you a few shillings that Yes and ELP will have vanished from the memory of all but 
the most s tubborn and that the Gary Glitters and Sweets of no lasting value will be regarded as 
representing the true sound of the 1970s.  
Having  said  that,  I’m  going  to  tell  you  about  a  new  recording  of  such  strength,  energy  and  
real beauty that to me it represents the first breakthrough into history that any musician regarded 
primarily  as  a  rock  musician  has  made.  Mike  Oldfield  …  
John Peel had an enormous following, and what he said was picked up by thousands of people 
across the country.  
We arranged for both Gong a nd Faust to tour the country, but it was the grand Tubular Bells  
concert planned for 25 June which I hoped would bring the national press to witness the music 
celebrity of the moment. We made the Tubular Bells  concert into an unmissable event. We managed to  have  Mick  Taylor,  then  The  Rolling  Stones’  guitarist,  Steve  Hillage  and  Hatfield  and  the  North  all  
agree to play various instruments. Viv Stanshall from The Bonzo Dog Doo -Dah Band agreed to be on 
stage and announce the instruments as he did on the record . 
On the day of the concert Mike came round to see me on the houseboat.  
‘Richard,’  he  said  quietly.  ‘I  can’t  go  through  with  this  concert  tonight.’  
‘But  it’s  all  arranged,’  I  said.  
‘I  simply  can’t  go  ahead,’  he  repeated  in  a  deathly  whisper.  
I felt a wave of despair. I knew Mike could be as stubborn as me when he wanted to be. I tried to 
forget that the whole concert was arranged, the tickets sold and even television coverage agreed. I 
couldn’t  use  any  of  that  as  leverage  since  it  would  only  strengthen  Mike ’s  resolve.  I  had  to  be  cunning.  
‘Let’s  go  for  a  drive,’  I  said  innocuously,  and  led  the  way  along  the  towpath  and  to  my  old  
Bentley parked outside. I knew that Mike had always admired this battleship -grey car with its faded 
red-leather seats. I hoped that  a soothing drive past the Queen Elizabeth Hall would put Mike in a 
different frame of mind. We drove off with Mike sitting bolt upright. After a monosyllabic drive we 
reached the Queen Elizabeth Hall and I slowed down. There were Mike Oldfield posters eve rywhere. 
Already a crowd of people were making their way to the concert.  
‘I  can’t  go  on  to  the  stage,’  Mike  repeated.  
I  couldn’t  tell  him  that  it  was  in  his  best  interests,  that  this  concert  might  catapult  him  into  a  
different league and put him up alongsi de Pink Floyd. I stopped the car.  
‘Do  you  want  to  drive?’  
‘All  right,’  Mike  said  cautiously.  
We drove on, over Westminster Bridge, past Victoria. I watched Hyde Park flash past the 
passenger window. Mike turned down Bayswater Road and drove near to the chu rch where I had 
edited Student  magazine.  
‘Mike,’  I  said.  ‘Would  you  like  to  have  this  car?  As  a  present?’  
‘A  present?’  
‘Yes.  I’ll  get  out  here  and  walk  home.  You  just  keep  on  driving  and  the  car’s  yours.’  
‘Come  off  it!  It  was  your  wedding  present.’  
‘All  you  have  to  do  is  then  drive  it  round  to  the  Queen  Elizabeth  Hall  and  go  up  on  stage  tonight.  
It’s  yours.’ 
A silence fell between us. I watched Mike as he held the steering wheel and imagined himself 
driving this car. I knew he was tempted. I hoped he  would agree.  ‘It’s  a  deal,’  Mike  said.  
I would have to tell Kristen and then my parents what I had done with our Bentley, but I knew 
they  wouldn’t  mind  too  much.  For  all  its  charm  and  sentimental  value,  the  Bentley  was  just  a  car.  It  
was vital to get Mike  up on stage and sell copies of Tubular Bells . If he was successful, I would be 
able to pick up any car I wanted. My mother would have approved.  
As the last bars of Tubular Bells  died away at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, there was a momentary 
silence as peopl e digested what they had just heard. They seemed mesmerised and nobody wanted to 
break the spell. Then they leapt to their feet in a standing ovation. I was sitting between Kristen and 
Simon and we stood up and cheered and applauded. Tears ran down my chee ks. Mike stood up in 
front of the organ, a tiny figure, and just bowed and said thank you. Even the band applauded him. He 
was a new star.  
That night we sold hundreds of copies of Tubular Bells . Mike was too shattered to speak to the 
press. Looking at all the  people  cheering  and  crowding  round  to  buy  his  record,  he  said,  ‘I  feel  as  if  
I’ve  been  raped,’  and  disappeared  off  in  his  new  Bentley.  Mike  refused  to  go  back  on  stage  for  many  
years afterward. Kristen and I walked home. From that night onward, Mike Ol dfield’s  Tubular Bells  
was set to become the most celebrated album of the year. Virgin Music was on the map, and the 
money started rolling in.  
Word of mouth spread and on 14 July Tubular Bells  entered the album charts at number twenty -
three. By August it w as number one. For the next fifteen years, whenever Mike Oldfield released an 
album it reached the top ten. Tubular Bells  eventually sold over thirteen million copies, making it the 
eleventh -bestselling album ever released in Britain. The sacrifice of my B entley was worth it. I never 
got round to buying another one.  
Although overnight Virgin was an established record label, we were a tiny company with a staff of 
seven and no ability to distribute records to all the record shops across the country. We had tw o 
options open to us. The first was to license our records to another, larger, record label. This would 
work only for fairly successful bands. The other company would give us an upfront payment for the 
right to promote the record, distribute it and keep th e bulk of the profits. If the record recouped its 
advance, the record company would pay us a royalty, typically around 16 per cent. This was the 
traditional arrangement for a fledgling record company like Virgin.  
The second option was more risky. Virgin would forego the upfront payment and the royalties, 
and simply pay another record label to manufacture and distribute the records as and when they were 
ordered by shops around the country. Virgin would be responsibl e for all the promotion of its records, 
and carry all the risk if the record failed. Correspondingly, we would have all the upside if the record 
sold well.  
Most small record labels licensed their records since it was easy money: they received 16 per cent 
royalties from the other company and paid out whatever they had agreed to the artist, say 5 or 10 per 
cent. But Simon and I decided that we would go for a manufacture and distribution deal (called 
‘Pressing  and  Distribution’  or  ‘P&D’).  It  was  a  bold  move  bu t even then I knew that it is only by 
being bold that you get anywhere. If you are a risk -taker, then the art is to protect the downside. It 
seemed to us that Tubular Bells  was so good that we could promote it ourselves. I felt sure that it would sell enou gh copies to pay back our investment. With the idea of asking for a P&D deal rather 
than a straight licensing agreement, we went to see Island Records.  
I had first come across Island Records when I was editing Student  magazine. It had been set up 
by Chris Blackwell, who was brought up in Jamaica and had almost single -handedly introduced 
reggae into Britain. Island released Bob Marley, who became the first reggae superstar, and among 
others they also produced Cat Stevens and Free.  
Predictably, at first Islan d refused to do a P&D deal. They already licensed Chrysalis and 
Charisma (which had Genesis), and they wanted Virgin too. So they offered us a highly attractive 
licensing deal with royalties of 18 per cent. We were paying Mike 5 per cent, which meant that if we 
accepted  Island’s  offer  we  could  collect  13  per  cent  of  the  sales  of   Tubular Bells  for ourselves. At 
£2.19 this was 28.5 pence a record, which would mean a total profit to us of around £171,000 if 
Tubular Bells  did astoundingly well and sold, say, 60 0,000 copies – that is to say reached double 
platinum. A record goes gold at 200,000 copies and platinum at 300,000 copies. If it reached a million 
copies, then Virgin would make £285,000 without having to pay for any of the costs of promoting and 
marketin g the record. To a seasoned eye Island were far better placed than Virgin to promote this 
record to all the shops across the country. Most small record companies in our place would have 
accepted it, and certainly both Island and our lawyers urged us to do so. 
But Simon and I felt differently. We had fourteen Virgin shops across the country which could 
promote Tubular Bells . The experience of selling 100,000 copies of Student  across the country had 
given me confidence that we could get this record out in qua ntity. Of course, our job was made much 
easier because Tubular Bells  was so good that people wanted to buy it as soon as they heard it.  
To an outsider this looked like an enormous gamble. If sales of Tubular Bells  had faded, Virgin 
Music would have been de ad in the water. But, if we managed to sell 600,000 copies, worth about 
£1.3  million,  Virgin  would  receive  around  £920,000  after  the  shops’  retail  margin.  Of  this,  we  would  
pay £65,700 to Mike Oldfield as the artist, and £197,100 to Island Records for pres sing and 
distributing the record, leaving us with around £658,000 to divide between promoting the record and 
keeping as profit to reinvest in other artists. This was the upside.  
The intellectual copyright of Tubular Bells  was our birthright, and we were de termined to build 
on  it.  So  we  turned  down  Island’s  offer  and  insisted  that  we  stick  to  a  P&D  deal.  They  would  press  
and distribute the record and we would pay them between 10 and 15 per cent for this. They still held 
out for a licensing deal until we thre atened to go to a rival record company, CBS. So we signed a P&D 
deal and sacrificed an immediate cash payment which would have been welcomed by Coutts, since the 
Manor was still in debt. We committed ourselves to selling Tubular Bells  with our own resource s. 
Island unwittingly fostered a cuckoo which grew up in their nest: Virgin Music. We became rich 
beyond our dreams as the sales of Tubular Bells  shot through silver, gold, platinum, double platinum 
and then up over a million copies. We grew into a major f orce in the record industry and eventually 
became the rival to Island Records. Although the royalty rates we paid Mike Oldfield and Island 
changed over time, as did the price of the record, Tubular Bells  went on to sell millions of copies and 
still sells a round the world today. Our gamble that we could promote it ourselves made us our first 
fortune.  8 ‘To  be  second  choice  means  nothing.’  
1974 –1976  
WHEN MIKE OLDFIELD DROVE  away in my old Bentley after the concert at the Queen Elizabeth 
Hall, he was already s pinning out of orbit. During all the months in which he had been incarcerated at 
the Manor with Tom Newman, working in complete privacy and achieving his perfect album, he had 
been dreaming about everyone buying Tubular Bells . But, when he stood up at the Queen Elizabeth 
Hall and saw the audience giving him a standing ovation, something inside him gave way. He found 
that,  although  this  adulation  was  something  he  had  yearned  for,  now  that  he  had  it  he  couldn’t  cope  
with it.  
The music industry can make people  rich beyond their dreams in a matter of months. Whether he 
liked  it  or  not,  Mike  was  now  caught  in  that  spiral  which  would  make  him  one  of  Britain’s  wealthiest  
men. The success was devastating to him, and I had to learn to live with that responsibility. I  found it 
impossible to answer the question as to whether I should have pushed him into doing that concert. 
Mike went to live in a remote part of Wales with a girlfriend, and refused to talk to anyone else except 
me. 
When I first drove down to visit him, I  could hardly find the house. It was a tiny stone cottage 
built on a range of hills called Hergest Ridge. The house had its back to the prevailing winds but it 
was so remote it was like Wuthering Heights. The whole of the front room was taken up with a gra nd 
piano. He took me up on to Hergest Ridge with a six -foot balsawood glider he had made. I watched 
him as he ran carefully down the hill and then gently launched the huge plane. It hardly seemed to 
move  at  first,  and  appeared  suspended  above  Mike’s  head,   but then the wind caught it and it banked, 
soaring up and flying away from us down the ridge towards the fields below. Mike watched it, the 
wind blowing his hair back from his eyes, and for the first time I saw him smile.  
I drove back to London and left Mi ke living on Hergest Ridge. In a sad reversal of my having 
Kristen’s  clothes  brought  round  to   Alberta  so that she would have to move in with me, Mike went to 
the  local  pub  one  night  and  asked  a  friend  to  pack  up  his  girlfriend’s  clothes  and  take  her  to  the  
station. For the next ten years, Mike Oldfield lived as a recluse and did no promotion for any of his 
albums. Fortunately, we had made a film of Mike playing Tubular Bells . We made it into a 
documentary and intercut it with pictures of abstract William Py e sculptures. The BBC showed it three 
times. Each time this film was broadcast, the sales of Tubular Bells  and  Mike’s  other  records  soared.  
Had Mike spent the next ten years touring, like Pink Floyd, I am sure that he would have become one 
of the biggest r ock  stars  in  the  world  and  John  Peel’s  prediction  would  have  come  true.  As  it  was,  
Tubular Bells  became more famous than Mike Oldfield, and, although he recorded many other 
beautiful albums, such as Ommadawn , my own favourite, none of them matched the succ ess of 
Tubular Bells . 
The  other  record  companies  were  mystified  by  Mike’s  reticence  to  perform.  Ahmet  Ertegun,  who  
had eventually, after much negotiation, licensed Tubular Bells  in  America,  couldn’t  understand  it:  
‘You’re  telling  me  that  you  have  a  film  of  sculptures  for  the  promo?’  he  snarled  at  me.  ‘I  don’t  
get  it.  I’m  not  sure  anyone  over  here  will  get  it  either.  We  can  all  visit  the  Met  if  we  want  to.’  As usual, Ahmet managed to come up with a solution: he sold Tubular Bells  as the soundtrack for 
the fi lm The Exorcist . As the film became a hit in America, so did the album. It finally reached the top 
of the American charts a year after it had done so in Britain.  
Simon and I developed three key aims when negotiating with bands. We never formally articulate d 
them to each other, but our negotiations over Mike Oldfield taught us these general principles.  
First, we set out to own copyright for as long as possible. We tried our hardest never to agree a 
deal where the copyright reverted to the artist, because the only assets a record company has are its 
copyrights. We also tried to incorporate as much as poss ible  of  an  artist’s  back  catalogue  into  our  
contract, although often this was tied up with other record labels. Beneath all the glamour of dealing 
with the rock stars, the only value lay in the intellectual copyright in their songs. We would thus offer 
high initial sums, but try to tie the artist in for eight albums. Over the life of Virgin Music, we prided 
ourselves that we had never lost a band. We never lost a band because we always renegotiated their 
contracts after a few albums, although, ironically, M ike Oldfield was one case where I was too slow to 
renegotiate and I almost lost him. The vital thing with a new band was, if you built them up, it would 
often be their third or fourth album that would be the most valuable. One good example of this was 
The Human League, who had made two albums on Virgin, each of which sold progressively better, 
but who then broke into the big time with their third album, Dare , which sold over 2 million copies. 
The last thing we wanted was to lose them after a couple of album s only to see them become 
successful with another record label. After we signed the artist up, we would soon try to extend the 
contract and, although we might give away 2 or 3 percentage points in royalties, it was a small 
concession in comparison with the  potential of adding another two albums on to the end of the 
contract.  
Right from the start Simon and I tried to position Virgin as an international company, and the 
second  thing  we  always  insisted  on  was  incorporating  worldwide  copyright  to  the  artist’s  work  in  our  
contracts. We would argue that there was less incentive for us to promote them in Britain if they then 
used their success here to sell well overseas with someone else.  
Our last negotiating point was to ensure that Virgin owned the copyright in the individual 
members of the band as well as the band itself. It was so metimes difficult to define a band: for 
example, The Rolling Stones clearly comprised Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Bill Wyman and Charlie 
Watts, but a number of other people came and went. The record industry finally defined The Rolling 
Stones  as  ‘Mick  Jag ger  plus  three  others’.  Some  bands  split  up  and  became  individually  successful.  
Genesis is perhaps the prime example, as Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins both became bigger stars 
outside Genesis than they had been within the band. We had to ensure that Virgi n  didn’t  sign  a  band  
only to be left with an empty shell while the lead guitarist went on to succeed as a solo artist on 
another label.  
The only other great truth we found was that, if we wanted a band enough, we had to sign them 
almost no matter how high the bidding went. An artist on another label remains just that: nothing to do 
with us. Part of the secret of running a record label was to build up momentum, to keep signing new 
bands and to keep breaking them into the big time. Even if a high -profile band  lost us money, there 
would be other, intangible, benefits, such as attracting others to sign with us, or opening doors to radio 
stations for our newer bands.  With these principles in our minds, Virgin began to sign up new bands on the back of Mike 
Oldfiel d’s  success.  The  bulk  of  these  would  inevitably  fail.  We  still  paid  ourselves  tiny  wages;;  we  still  
all  lived  in  each  other’s  pocket,  and  we  reinvested  all  the  money  we  earned  from   Tubular Bells  in new 
artists and building up the company.  
Kristen and I had been married for two years but we were having too many difficulties together and, 
eventually, we decided to divorce. As well as my marriage breaking up in 1974, Virgin Music was 
beginning  to  have  some  problems.  In  August  1974  Mike  Oldfield’s  next  album,   Hergest Ridge , went 
straight to number one. Since Tubular Bells  was still at number two, money kept coming in. But 
Virgin  was  in  danger  of  being  seen  as  just  Mike  Oldfield’s  label.  In  spite  of  refusing  to  do  any  
promotion  himself,  Mike’s  sales  were  so  large   that he eclipsed anyone else.  
During that rather awkward patch between 1974 and 1976 when Mike Oldfield was our only 
superstar, Virgin failed to sign 10cc, The Who and Pink Floyd, despite fighting hard for them. It 
seemed that we were destined to be foreve r the second choice, and in music as in so many other things 
the second choice means nothing. At the end of 1975 I pitched for The Rolling Stones. Word had got 
about that we had been prepared to pay £350,000 for 10cc: it astonished our rival record labels like 
Island.  When  I  called  up  The  Stones’  manager,  Prince  Rupert  Loewenstein,  he  was  prepared  to  listen  
to me seriously, having heard about our 10cc offer.  
‘How  much  are  you  asking  for?’  I  asked  him.  
‘You’ll  never  be  able  to  afford  it,’  Prince  Rupert  told   me  sympathetically.  ‘It’ll  be  at  least  $3  
million.  And,  anyway,  Virgin  is  just  too  small.’  
I knew that the only way to get his attention was to considerably better that offer.  
‘I’ll  offer  $4  million,’  I  said.  ‘As  long  as  there  is  some  back  catalogue  availa ble.’ 
Buying the back catalogue would enable Virgin to release a greatest -hits album and would be a 
good insurance policy if the new record failed.  
‘I’ll  send  you  round  the  list  of  the  back  catalogue  that’s  available,’  Prince  Rupert  said.  ‘If  you  can  
bring  a  bank  guarantee  for  $4  million  to  my  office  by  Monday  then  I’ll  look  at  it  very  seriously.  Best  
of  luck.’ 
It was Friday. Prince Rupert assumed that he had set me an impossible task.  
That weekend I travelled around the chain of Virgin distributors we had set up across Europe in 
France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Sweden and Norway. As I travelled I was constantly on the 
telephone to those in the rest of the world. I was looking to raise about £250,000 from each distributor. 
By the end of the weekend I had tra cked them all down and asked them to send telegrams to Coutts in 
London confirming that they would provide the money. By Monday morning I was back in London 
but still some way short of the $4 million I had promised Prince Rupert. After adding up all the 
different commitments from the distributors, Coutts promised to make up the difference. I drove round 
to  Prince  Rupert’s  house  in  Petersham  just  before  eleven  o’clock  with  a  bank  guarantee  for  $4  million.  Prince Rupert was dumbfounded. I had caught him compl etely off guard. He fingered the $4 
million cheque but then gave it back.  
‘You’ll  have  a  chance  to  match  the  highest  offer,’  he  promised.  ‘But  you’ve  started  an  auction.’  
In the end EMI won the auction with a bid of $5 million and signed The Rolling Stones . I 
couldn’t  raise  any  more  than  the  $4  million.  Although  I  was  disappointed  to  have  failed,  I  knew  that  I  
had done The Stones a good turn by increasing the asking price from the $3 million Prince Rupert 
would have been happy to accept.  
By 1976 the necessi ty of signing the really big bands was beyond frustration. Virgin had two albums 
in  the  top  ten:  Gong,  and  Mike  Oldfield’s   Ommadawn .  These  were  the  days  of  Genesis’s   Trick Of The 
Tail and  Bob  Dylan’s   Desire . Our trouble was that we had spent most of Mike O ldfield’s  royalties  on  
signing up new bands and, with the exception of Tangerine Dream, had had no major breakthroughs. 
Tangerine  Dream’s   Phaedra  had become a top -selling album across Europe, and greatly enhanced 
Virgin’s  reputation.  Our  catalogue  was  full  of wonderful, credible music, but we did not have enough 
really big sellers. More immediately, we were running out of cash.  
On top of that, Mike Oldfield wanted to renegotiate his contract. We were happy to renegotiate 
but, after we agreed a second versio n with an increased royalty to him, he instructed another lawyer 
who  began  to  push  for  an  even  higher  royalty.  Simon  and  I  decided  that  Virgin  couldn’t  go  any  higher.  
We pointed out that Virgin Music as a company was making less money than he was personall y. 
When he asked how this was possible, I made the mistake of being completely honest with him. I told 
him that we needed successful artists like him to pay for our unsuccessful ones. His sympathy 
evaporated.  
‘I’m  not  giving  money  away  for  you  to  blow  on  a  whole  load  of  rubbish,’  he  said.  ‘I’m  going  
back  to  my  lawyer.’  
Eventually we agreed another contract and Mike stayed with us. But it was a close -run thing.  
In the summer of 1976 we had a crisis meeting with Simon, Nik and Ken Berry. Ken had started 
in the  Notting  Hill  record  shop  as  a  clerk.  It  was  his  job  to  check  the  shop’s  takings,  but  soon  he  took  
over a whole range of other jobs. We all found that whenever we needed to know anything – the sales 
of Pink Floyd that week, the staff wages due, the deprec iation on the old Saabs we ran – Ken knew all 
the answers. Ken became indispensable. He was quiet and unassuming but, as well as dealing with the 
numbers, his great skill was dealing with people: he was utterly unfazed by negotiating with top rock 
stars an d their lawyers, and soon he became involved in working through the contract negotiations. 
Simon and I watched him and, as we realised that he would never lose a deal by throwing his ego 
around and trying to score points off the other side, so we gave him more and more responsibility. The 
original trio – me, Nik and Simon – made room for Ken, and in many ways he became the link that 
held us all together.  
At that crisis meeting, we went through the figures of the shops, which were trading well but not 
very p rofitably. I knew that Nik was pushing them for all he was worth, and we were loath to criticise 
anything he was doing. Then we started going through the Virgin roster. One by one we debated 
whether we could afford to keep acts like Hatfield and the North or Dave Bedford that cost us money 
to promote and looked unlikely ever to break into the big time.  ‘It’s  clear  to  me,’  Ken  Berry  said,  adding  up  a  column  of  figures.  ‘We  have  to  seriously  consider  
scrapping  all  our  bands  apart  from  Mike  Oldfield.’  
We looke d at him in amazement.  
‘All  our  other  bands  are  losing  us  money,’  he  went  on.  ‘If  we  sacked  at  least  half  our  staff,  then  
we  could  cope  very  well,  but  at  the  moment  Mike  Oldfield  is  bankrolling  the  entire  company.’  
I have always believed that the only way to cope with a cash crisis is not to contract but to try to 
expand out of it.  
‘What  about  if  we  found  ten  more  Mike  Oldfields?’  I  asked,  teasing  him.  ‘How  would  that  do?’  
Ultimately, we had two options: either tuck away a little money and eke out a living without 
taking any more risks, or use our last few pounds to try to sign up another band that could break us 
back into the big time. If we chose the first option, we could get by: we would be running a tiny 
company, but we could survive and make a living w ithout any risks attached. If we chose the second, 
Virgin could be bust within a few months, but at least we would have one last chance to break out.  
Simon and I wanted to have one last go at breaking a new band. Nik and Ken eventually agreed 
with us, although I could see that they were reluctant to bet the entire company on a breakthrough. 
From that night, we were on an emergency footing, desperately s earching for The Next Big Thing.  
In the meantime we cut back on whatever we could: we sold our cars; we closed down the 
swimming  pool  at  the  Manor;;  we  cut  down  on  the  stock  in  the  record  shops;;  we  didn’t  pay  ourselves;;  
we dropped a few artists from the rec ord label and made nine staff redundant. This was the most 
difficult of all, and I shied away from the emotional confrontation and let Nik do it.  
One of the artists we reluctantly dropped was Dave Bedford, who was a brilliantly gifted classical 
composer. D ave reacted very well to the bad news: he wrote a long letter to me saying how much he 
understood the decision, that he appreciated his records had not sold, that he would have done the 
same if he had been in my shoes, that he bore Virgin no grudges and wi shed us all the best for the 
future. At the same time he wrote a letter to Mike Oldfield in which he described me as a complete 
shit, an utter bastard, and a vile, tone -deaf, money -grabbing parasite on musical talent. Unfortunately 
for Dave, he then put th e letters in the wrong envelopes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 9 Never mind the bollocks  
1976 –1977  
BY AUGUST OF 1976 VIRGIN  was in real trouble. We were trying to sign some of the aggressive 
punk bands which were coming on the scene, but we seemed to keep missing out. For instance, we 
missed getting the Boomtown Rats because I insisted on including the music publishing rights, which 
they wanted to sell elsewhere. We were unable to find a new band that could lift us out of our rut or 
dispel our image as a rather hippie label.  
Among our other worries we were in the middle of a dispute with Gong over some recording 
rights. Some of their followers came into the Vernon Yard offices to stage a protest. Our offices were 
invaded by a host of benign, bearded, long -haired and very peaceful activists wearing kaftans and 
sandals and smoking joints. They had the appearance of a wandering band  of druids and wizards. 
After an enjoyable afternoon spent slouched on the sofas listening to Gong, Henry Cow and Mike 
Oldfield, and trying to talk me into signing some petition, they decided to leave. We stood by the front 
door and thanked them for coming . As they left we gently relieved them of their pickings – mainly 
records they were trying to conceal in the flowing folds of their kaftans, but one or two of them were 
making off with posters, tapes, staplers, and even a telephone. They all smiled when th ey were caught 
and left in the best of spirits. I followed them out into Portobello Road and watched them wander 
away through the fruit stalls. One of them stopped to buy some dates. As the stallholder sold him the 
fruit a man with his hair shaved into a m ohican and dyed pink and green walked by.  
The kaftaned followers of Gong looked uncomprehendingly at the punk, picked up their dates 
and walked off, munching slowly.  
‘I’m  going  to  be  out  for  ten  minutes,’  I  told  Penni,  my  assistant.  
I went up Portobello Ro ad and found somewhere to have a haircut.  
‘How  much  off?’  asked  the  barber.  
‘I  think  it’s  about  time  I  got  some  value  for  money,’  I  said.  ‘Take  about  a  foot  and  half  off  and  
let’s  see  what  I  look  like  underneath.’  
In place of names like Hatfield and the No rth and Tangerine Dream, a string of new bands had 
taken over the poster sites. They were called names like The Damned, The Clash, The Stranglers and, 
most notorious of all, The Sex Pistols.  
In the last week of November I was working in my office when I he ard this extraordinary song 
being  played  in  Simon’s  office  directly  below  me.  I  had  never  heard  anything  like  it.  I  ran  downstairs  
to see him.  
‘What  was  that?’  I  asked.  
‘It’s  The  Sex  Pistols’  single.  It’s  called  “Anarchy  In  The  UK”.’  
‘How’s  it  doing?’  ‘Very  well,’  Simon  admitted.  ‘Very  well  indeed.’  
‘Who’s  signed  them  up?’  
‘EMI.  I  turned  them  down  a  couple  of  months  ago.  I  could  have  made  a  mistake.’  
There was something so raw and powerful about the song that I was determined to see whether 
we could win the m back. A few days later, I called up Leslie Hill, the managing director of EMI. He 
was far too busy and important to take my call, so I left a message with his secretary saying that if he 
ever  wanted  to  get  rid  of  his  ‘embarrassment’,  then  he  should  conta ct me. Half an hour later she called 
me back to say that EMI were quite happy with The Sex Pistols, thank you.  
That very evening, 1 December, at 5.30p.m., The Sex Pistols caused a national furore. They were 
being interviewed on Today , an afternoon televisi on show hosted by Bill Grundy. Bill Grundy had 
rolled back from a good lunch at Punch  and realised that the four lads in his studio were fairly drunk 
as well. He started to mock them, talking about other great composers, Mozart, Bach and Beethoven. 
It was all  a  bit  silly,  until  Johnny  Rotten  spilt  his  drink  in  one  corner  and  quietly  swore:  ‘Shit.’  
‘What  did  you  say?’  Grundy  asked.  ‘What  was  that?  Didn’t  I  hear  you  say  a  rude  word?’  
‘It  was  nothing,’  Rotten  said.  
‘Come  on,  what  was  it?’  
Grundy got what he as ked for.  
‘I  said,  “Shit”,’  Rotten  told  him.  
‘Really?’  Grundy  said.  ‘Good  heavens,  you  frighten  me  to  death.’  
Then Grundy turned to Siouxsie Sioux, who was the other guest, and asked her whether she 
would meet him afterward. Steve Jones, one of The Sex Pistols, laughed and called him a dirty old 
sod. Grundy then turned to him and goaded him into saying more swear words. Jones called him a 
‘dirty  fucker’  and  a  ‘fucking  rotter’,  and  that  was  the  end  of  the  show.  
The  next  day  the  national  press  were  once  again  outraged  by  The  Sex  Pistols’  behaviour.  Nobody  
criticised Bill Grundy for baiting them into swearing. As I wa s having my breakfast and reading an 
article about how someone had kicked in their television in disgust at the show, the telephone rang. It 
was not yet 7.00a.m. In a wonderful role reversal, the managing director of EMI was now personally 
calling me.  
‘Please  come  and  see  me  immediately,’  he  said.  ‘I  gather  that  you’re  interested  in  signing  The  
Sex  Pistols.’  
I  went  straight  round  to  EMI’s  offices.  Leslie  Hill  and  I  agreed  that  EMI  would  transfer  The  Sex  
Pistols to Virgin, conditional upon Malcolm McLaren, t he  group’s  manager,  agreeing.  We  shook  
hands. Then Malcolm McLaren was ushered in from the next -door room.  ‘Virgin  have  offered  to  take  The  Sex  Pistols  on,’  Hill  said,  trying  unsuccessfully  to  keep  the  relief  
out of his voice.  
‘Excellent,’  McLaren  said,  of fering  me  his  hand.  ‘I’ll  come  to  your  offices  later  this  afternoon.’  
I normally make up my mind about whether I can trust somebody within sixty seconds of 
meeting them. As I watched Malcolm McLaren, with his tight black trousers and pointed boots, I 
wonde red how easy it would be to do business with him. He never showed up at Vernon Yard that 
afternoon, and never returned my phone calls the next day. I stopped ringing him after four attempts. 
He  knew  how  to  get  hold  of  me,  but  he  didn’t  call.  
On 9 March 197 7 McLaren signed The Sex Pistols to A&M records. The ceremony was staged 
outside Buckingham Palace, where the four punks lined up and screamed abuse at the royal family. 
The band were just four regular lads, but they were being whipped up by Malcolm McLare n. 
I sat at my desk and wondered about Malcolm McLaren. I knew that he had a bestseller on his 
hands,  a  band  which  would  transform  Virgin’s  image.  If  Virgin  could  sign  The  Sex  Pistols,  it  would,  
at a stroke, remove the hippie image which was hanging over u s. EMI sneered at Virgin and called us 
‘The  Earl’s  Court  Hippies’.  Never  mind  that  we  lived  nowhere  near  Earl’s  Court:  the  name  stuck  and  I  
didn’t  like  it.  We  were  stuck  with  the  image  of  Gong  and  Mike  Oldfield.  The  royalty  cheques  were  
impressive, but I f eared that none of the new punk bands would take us seriously if we only had a 
number of hippie bands. Virgin Music needed to change and to change quickly, and The Sex Pistols 
could do it for us.  
‘Every  band  is  a  risk,’  Derek  Green,  managing  director  of  A& M,  airily  told  the  press.  ‘But  in  my  
opinion  The  Sex  Pistols  are  less  of  a  risk  than  most.’  
A&M  hosted  a  party  to  celebrate  the  signing  of  The  Sex  Pistols.  Since  A&M  were  ‘capitalists’  
making  money  out  of  bands  by  ‘exploiting’  them,  The  Sex  Pistols  hated  t hem as they hated all record 
companies – or  at  least  they  pretended  to.  Sid  Vicious,  then  the  band’s  bassist,  excelled  himself  
immediately  after  the  signing  by  wrecking  Derek  Green’s  office  and  being  sick  all  over  his  desk.  As  
soon as I heard this I reache d for my telephone to try one last shot. To my delight, Derek Green told 
me he was dropping them.  
‘Can  we  sign  them?’  I  asked.  
‘If  you  can  cope  with  them,’  he  said.  ‘We  certainly  can’t.’  
The Sex Pistols were given £75,000 by A&M as compensation for the can celled contract. 
Together with the £50,000 they had been given from EMI, they had earned £125,000 for doing 
nothing more than a bit of swearing and vomiting and one single. Once again, The Sex Pistols were 
looking for a record label.  
I began to marvel at h ow Malcolm McLaren had played his cards so well. The Sex Pistols were 
now the most shocking band in the country. Among all the punk bands which now rapidly 
materialised,  The  Sex  Pistols  were  still  the  most  notorious.  They  had  a  single  called  ‘God  Save  The  
Queen’  which  I  knew  they  wanted  to  release  in  time  for  the  Queen’s  Silver  Jubilee  Day  in  July  1977.  I  watched  and  waited,  knowing  that  Malcolm  McLaren  didn’t  like  me.  He  sneered  at  me  as  a  
hippie who had become a businessman. But, as the weeks passed and J ubilee Day came closer, 
nobody else came forward to sign The Sex Pistols. I knew that Virgin was perhaps the only record 
label who could do it. We had no shareholders to protest, no parent company or boss to tell me not to. 
On 12 May 1977 Malcolm McLaren f inally came to see us. The tables had turned. Virgin signed the 
British  rights  for  The  Sex  Pistols’  first  album  for  £15,000,  with  a  further  £50,000  payable  for  rights  for  
the rest of the world.  
‘Do  you  realise  what  you’re  getting  into?’  McLaren  asked  me.  
‘I  do,’  I  assured  him.  ‘The  question  is,  do  you?’  
From the moment we signed The Sex Pistols, McLaren was looking for ways to alienate us so 
that   we’d   be   sufficiently   embarrassed   to   want   to   get   rid   of   them.   To   McLaren’s   horror   and  
bemusement we refused to be  outraged.  We  released  ‘God  Save  The  Queen’,  which  was  banned  by  
BBC radio and soared to number two in the charts. It would have been number one, but record shops 
like Virgin and HMV, which would be likely to be selling large quantities of the record, were  
excluded from the sample taken in order to compile the charts.  
On Jubilee Day 1977, Malcolm McLaren rented a Thames pleasure cruiser and steamed upriver 
towards the House of Commons. The police knew that something was up, and as we set off from 
Westminster Pier two police launches shadowed us. The band waited until th ey were right alongside 
the House of Commons and then they picked up their guitars and drumsticks and roared out their own 
version of the national anthem:  
God save the Queen,  
A fascist regime,  
Made you a moron,  
A potential H -bomb.  
God save the Queen.  
She ain’t  no  human  being,  
There  ain’t  no  future  in  England’s  dream,  
NO FUTURE! NO FUTURE!  
The police pulled up alongside and insisted that the band stop playing. This was unwarranted 
since  the  boat  had  a  licence  for  bands  to  play.  It  brought  back  memories  of  The  Beatles’  last  ever  live  
performance on the rooftop of the Apple studios when the po lice pulled the plug on them. If it had 
been Frank Sinatra on board there would have been no problem. The police boarded our boat and 
steered us back to the pier, where they arrested Malcolm McLaren, mainly because he put up such a 
spirited fight and start ed  yelling,  ‘Fascist  pigs!’  That  week  we  sold  over  100,000  copies  of  ‘God  Save  The  Queen’.  It  was  clearly  the  number -one 
record, but Top of the Pops  and  the  BBC  claimed  that  Rod  Stewart  was  really  the  number  one.  ‘God  
Save  The  Queen’  was  banned  from  the  te levision and radio. From our point of view it was good 
business: the more it was banned, the better it sold.  
The Sex Pistols were a turning point for us, the band we had been looking for. They put Virgin 
back on the map, as a record company that could gene rate a huge amount of publicity, and that could 
cope with punk rock. The Sex Pistols were a national event: every shopper up and down the high 
street, every farmer, everyone on every bus, every grandmother, had heard of The Sex Pistols. And 
living close to  that  kind  of  public  outcry  was  fascinating.  As  Oscar  Wilde  pointed  out,  ‘The  only  thing  
worse  than  being  talked  about  is  not  being  talked  about.’  The  Sex  Pistols  generated  more  newspaper  
cuttings than anything else in 1977 apart from the Silver Jubilee it self. Their notoriety was practically 
a tangible asset. Most of the press was negative, but so had it been for The Rolling Stones when they 
had set out fifteen years earlier.  
In November 1977 Virgin released Never  Mind  The  Bollocks,  Here’s  The  Sex  Pistols . The 
lettering on the album sleeve was a brilliant design by Jamie Reid, crudely cut out from newspaper 
headlines  in  the  same  way  as  kidnappers’  notes  and  hate  mail  were  delivered.  Virgin  shops  put  large  
yellow posters in their windows advertising the reco rd. Not surprisingly, there would always be 
someone who was offended by this. One day the manager of our shop in Nottingham was arrested 
under the same Indecent Advertisements Act of 1889 for which I had been arrested nearly ten years 
previously, when the Student Advisory Centre had advertised help for people suffering from venereal 
disease. I called John Mortimer, who had defended me then.  
‘I’m  afraid  we’ve  fallen  foul  of  the  Indecent  Advertisements  Act  again,’  I  told  him.  ‘The  police  
are saying that we ca n’t  use  the  word  “bollocks”.’  
‘Bollocks?’  he  asked.  ‘What  on  earth’s  wrong  with  bollocks?  It’s  one  of  my  favourite  words.’  
‘They’re  making  us  take  down  The  Sex  Pistols’  posters  saying  “Never  mind  the  bollocks,  here’s  
The  Sex  Pistols”,  and  they’re  threateni ng  to  injunct  the  album.’  
He told me that we needed a linguistic adviser, a professor of English who could define the exact 
meaning  of  ‘bollocks’  for  us.  Since  the  case  had  been  brought  in  Nottingham,  I  called  up  Nottingham  
University.  
‘Please  can  I  speak   to  your  professor  of  linguistics?’  I  asked.  
‘That  would  be  Professor  James  Kinsley,’  said  the  lady  on  reception.  
I was put through and explained the situation.  
‘So  one  of  your  staff  has  been  arrested  for  displaying  the  word  “bollocks”?’  said  Professor  
Kins ley.  ‘What  a  load  of  bollocks!  Actually,  the  word  “bollocks”  is  an  eighteenth -century nickname 
for priests. And then, because priests generally seemed to speak such a lot of nonsense in their 
sermons,  “bollocks”  gradually  came  to  mean  “rubbish”.’  ‘So  “boll ocks”  actually  means  either  “priest”  or  “rubbish”?’  I  checked,  making  sure  I  hadn’t  
missed anything.  
‘That  is  correct,’  he  said.  
‘Would  you  be  prepared  to  be  a  witness  in  court?’  I  asked.  
‘I’d  be  delighted,’  he  said.  
I enjoyed the court case. The police pr osecutor was determined to win what was clearly a case of 
national importance. Our shop manager was cross -examined and admitted that he had prominently 
displayed  The  Sex  Pistols’  poster  in  the  shop  window.  The  police  officer  recited  how  he  had  arrested  
him since he was displaying this offensive poster. The policeman had the smug look of someone who 
was doing the public a great service and expected to be praised for it.  
‘No  questions,’  John  Mortimer  said  when  he  was  invited  to  cross -examine the policeman.  
Rather disappointed, the policeman stood down.  
‘I  would  like  to  call  my  witness,’  John  Mortimer  said  when  he  stood  up.  ‘Professor  James  
Kinsley,  professor  of  linguistics  at  Nottingham  University.’  
As   Professor   James   Kinsley   explained   that   ‘bollocks’   was   noth ing to do with testicles but 
actually  meant  ‘priests’  and  then   – due  to  priests’  sermons  being  full  of  it   – ‘rubbish’,  John  Mortimer  
peered at him myopically and appeared to be struggling to straighten out his thoughts.  
‘So,  Professor  Kinsley,  are  you  sayi ng  that  this  expression  “Never  mind  the  bollocks,  here’s  The  
Sex  Pistols”,  which  is  the  basis  of  this  prosecution,  should  more  accurately  be  translated  as  “Never  
mind  the  priests,  here’s  The  Sex  Pistols”?’  asked  John  Mortimer.  
‘I  am.  Or  it  could  mean  “Neve r  mind  the  rubbish,  here’s  The  Sex  Pistols”.’  
John  Mortimer  allowed  a  silence  to  develop  in  the  court.  ‘“Never  mind  the  priests,  here’s  The  
Sex  Pistols”,’  he  mused.  ‘That  is  the  meaning  of  this  expression.  Well,  I  have  nothing  further  to  add.  It  
sounds lik e  a  strange  title  for  a  record,  but  I  doubt  whether  the  Church  would  mind.’  
‘I  doubt  they  would  either,’  Professor  Kinsley  agreed.  
The prosecutor then pressed Professor Kinsley on this point, asking him how he could be sure 
that no clergyman would be offen ded. 
Professor Kinsley then played his trump card by folding down his polo neck to reveal a dog 
collar. Professor Kinsley was also known as Reverend Kinsley.  
‘That’s  enough,’  snapped  the  magistrate.  He  straightened  his  back,  squared  his  shoulders  and,  
adopting as much magisterial solemnity as he could muster, announced:  
‘The  case  is  dismissed.’  10 ‘“I  thought  I’d  move  in,”  Joan  said.’  
1976 –1978  
ONE WEEKEND IN EARLY  1976 I met my future wife, Joan Templeman, at the Manor. I make up 
my mind about someone within thirty seconds of meeting them, and I fell for Joan almost from the 
moment I saw her. The problem was that she was already married to someon e else, a record producer 
and keyboard player who was producing a Virgin band called Wigwam.  
Joan was a down -to-earth Scots lady, and I immediately saw that she did not suffer fools gladly. I 
knew  that  I  couldn’t  attract  her  attention  in  the  same  way  as  I   had attracted Kristen. Most of my past 
relationships with women had been based on great public showmanship, but for the first time I felt that 
here  was  a  woman  who  didn’t  want  me  to  get  up  to  my  usual  antics.  
Joan worked in an antiques shop called Dodo on Westbourne Grove, close to our offices at 
Vernon Yard. On Monday morning I hovered uncertainly outside the shop, then screwed up my 
courage and walked in. The shop sold old signs and advertisements. When I asked the lady who 
owned the shop whether Joan was  there, she looked at me suspiciously.  
‘Are  you  a  customer?’  she  asked,  glowering.  
‘Yes,  I’m  fascinated  by  old  signs,’  I  said,  looking  uncertainly  around  the  shop.  
Joan came through from the back.  
‘I  see  you’ve  met  Liz,’  she  said.  ‘Liz,  this  is  Richard.’  
‘So  what  would  you  like  to  buy?’  Liz  pressed  me.  
There was no way out. Over the next few weeks, my visits to Joan amassed me an impressive 
collection of old handpainted tin signs which advertised anything from Hovis bread to Woodbine 
cigarettes. One tin sig n read DIVE IN HERE FOR TEA!  I also bought a large pig which played the 
cymbals  and  had  once  stood  in  a  butcher’s  shop.  One  of  my  favourite  signs  was  an  old  picture  
advertising Danish bacon and eggs which showed a pig leaning casually against a wall listen ing to a 
chicken singing. The chicken was celebrating her freshly laid egg and the caption to the scene was 
NOW,  THAT’S  WHAT  I  CALL  MUSIC ! I gave this to Simon Draper, since he was always terribly 
grumpy in the mornings until he had eaten a decent breakfas t. He hung it over his desk, where it later 
inspired the title for our annual greatest -hits compilations, Now  That’s  What  I  Call  Music . By the time 
I had bought all my Christmas presents from Dodo, Liz told Joan that she was the best shop assistant 
she had  ever had.  
Joan had been married to her husband, Ronnie Leahy, for almost eight years, but they had no 
children. Ronnie travelled a good deal, and it seemed to me, perhaps conveniently, that he and Joan 
had begun to drift apart. Whenever Ronnie was away, I  called  up  Joan’s  friends  and  asked  whether  
they were seeing Joan.  
‘Mind  if  I  tag  along?’  I  asked  casually.  They  soon  called  me  ‘Tag -along’,  which  I  really  didn’t  mind  as  long  as  by  tagging  along  I  had  
the chance to sit somewhere near Joan and talk with he r. Our courtship was unlike the other romances 
I’d  had,  which  I’d  been  able  to  control.  Joan  is  an  intensely  private  person,  and  it  was  extremely  
difficult to find out the state of her marriage. While I knew what I felt about her, I had very little idea 
what Joan made of me. I thought that she might be intrigued by my persistence, but beyond that I was 
in the dark.  
Eventually, Joan agreed to come with me to the Isle of Wight, and we spent the weekend in a tiny 
hotel in Bembridge. It was the start of our aff air. Since Joan was married we both carried on living 
double lives. She could not see me during the week, when Ronnie was at home, but early one morning 
she decided to surprise me by dropping round to my house in Denbigh Terrace, where I was still 
living. As she let herself in, she saw my cleaning lady Martha going up the stairs to my bedroom 
carrying a tray with two cups of tea on it. Joan knew that I was in bed with another woman – which I 
was – so she stopped Martha and put a flower on the tray.  
‘Just  say  to  Richard  that  Joan  says  hello,’  she  said,  and  then  turned  on  her  heel  and  went  back  to  
the shop.  
I was mortified. I dashed round to see her at Dodo and persuaded her to have lunch with me.  
‘So  what’s  all  this  about  undying  love?’  Joan  asked  sarcastical ly. 
‘Well,  I  was  lonely,’  I  said  lamely.  ‘I  couldn’t  wait  until  the  weekend.’  
‘That’s  a  pathetic  excuse!’  Joan  said.  
I  tried  to  look  ashamed  of  myself  and  contrite,  but  we  caught  each  other’s  eye  and  then  both  burst  
out laughing.  
Our affair continued for a lmost a year. We were desperate to be with each other, and would call 
each other up whenever we had five minutes to spare. Joan would slip away from Dodo and I would 
leave Vernon Yard, and we would meet at Denbigh Terrace, which was right between us. The 
geography of our affair was very tight -knit: Vernon Yard, Westbourne Grove and Denbigh Terrace all 
cross Portobello Road within twenty yards of each other, and so Joan and I lived out our affair within 
a tiny intense triangle.  
When we stole twenty precious minutes at lunch, quarter of an hour before a meeting, or a few 
moments after Dodo shut up shop, we tried to shut the outside world away. But, along with the 
passion, we were also intensely aware that Joan was married (indeed, on paper, I was in the same 
situation myself), and that we were in danger of causing pain to Ronnie. In some ways Joan and 
Ronnie  had  a  similar  relationship  to  Kristen’s  and  mine:  Ronnie  had  wanted  to  experiment  with  
sleeping with other women and had told Joan that she needed to broad en her horizons, too. Joan had 
been  at  a  loss  because  she  wasn’t  able  to  cope  with  a  series  of  one -night stands, and so she gradually 
began to fall in love with me.  
Our affair was further complicated when Kristen heard that I was in love with Joan and arri ved 
back in London. By this time I had managed to buy Duende  back from Kevin Ayers. At more or less 
the same time, Kristen had left him. She now told me that she wanted to get back together with me. We were, after all, still married. My family has always m aintained that you stick with your marriage 
through thick and thin, and so I felt a great responsibility to agree to Kristen. But I was in love with 
Joan. It was a nightmarish situation for each of us: Joan felt torn between me and Ronnie; Kristen had 
been  torn between me and Kevin; and I now felt torn between Kristen and Joan. What had started off 
as a dream affair with Joan in the tiny bedroom in the house at Denbigh Terrace was now beginning to 
destroy  five  people’s  lives.  
The tangle of these four relati onships finally resolved itself when I was at a party with both Joan 
and  Kristen.  Joan’s  best  friend  Linda  cornered  me:  
‘So  who  are  you  actually  in  love  with?’  she  demanded.  ‘This  can’t  go  on.  You’re  all  killing  
yourselves  and  you  need  to  sort  it  out.’  
I saw Joan talking to someone else.  
‘I’m  in  love  with  one  woman,’  I  said,  looking  across  at  Joan.  ‘But  she’s  not  in  love  with  me.’  
‘I’m  telling  you  that  she  is,’  said  Linda,  following  my  look.  
We left it at that.  
The next night I was alone on Duende . It wa s a dark February night and raining hard. I was on 
the  telephone  so  I  didn’t  hear  the  sound  of  knocking.  Then  the  door  opened  and  I  swung  round.  It  was  
Joan. 
‘I’ll  call  you  back  later,’  I  said  to  the  phone,  and  moved  across  to  hug  her.  
‘Well,  I  thought  I’d  move  in,’  Joan  said.  
‘We’ve  had  another  Nigerian  order,’  Chris  Stylianou  told  me.  ‘They  love  this  guy  U -Roy.’ 
Chris  Stylianou  was  now  Virgin’s  export  manager,  and  throughout  the  last  few  months  of  1977  
had  picked  up  thousands  of  pounds’  worth  of  business   from, of all bizarre places, Nigeria. The 
Nigerians loved reggae music. At the time, virtually the only British record label that sold reggae was 
Chris  Blackwell’s  Island  Records.  
In  1976  I  had  followed  Chris  Blackwell’s  footsteps  to  Jamaica  with  a  view  to  signing some 
reggae acts. After sitting on his veranda for days on end I had finally managed to sign up Peter Tosh, 
who had sung with Bob Marley, and a performer called U -Roy. Legalize It ,  Peter  Tosh’s  first  album  
with Virgin, had sold well in 1977. But n ow there was a different sound: Jamaican DJs and radio jocks 
were cutting their own records and chanting a whole lot of rhyming slang and political slogans to a 
background  beat.  It  was  an  early  form  of  rap  music.  They  were  called  ‘toasters’  and  it  was  U -Roy, a 
bejewelled hipster, who was doing so well in Nigeria. I knew that there must be more toasters out in 
Jamaica and I decided we should go out there and corner the market.  
I  always  like  to  get  away  from  London  in  the  middle  of  winter.  I’ve  found  that  sun shine and 
long-distance travel always gives me a clearer perspective on London life. And this time I had two 
extra reasons to get away from the city: I wanted to take Johnny Rotten with me because he was having some difficulties with The Sex Pistols and Ma lcolm McLaren; I also hoped to meet up with 
Joan, who was going to Los Angeles with Ronnie to give their marriage one last chance. Johnny 
Rotten was delighted to come since he loved reggae, and Joan and I agreed not to speak until she had 
resolved her marr iage one way or another.  
At the last minute, Simon was unable to come with me and I went with Ken. And so, at the start 
of  1978,  a  punk  rocker,  an  accountant  and  a  reformed  Earl’s  Court  hippie  flew  together  to  Kingston,  
Jamaica, to sign up some reggae band s  and  look  for  toasters.  Knowing  that  Jamaicans  didn’t  trust  
written contracts, we flew in with a briefcase containing $30,000 in cash and set up shop in the 
Kingston Sheraton. Word soon went around that three gringos were in town looking to audition 
music ians, and a stream of bands started coming round to the hotel room. Ken sat on the bed with his 
briefcase;;  Johnny  and  I  listened  to  the  bands’  tapes  and  chatted  to  them.  Johnny  decided  which  artists  
we should sign, and then Ken would open up the briefcase and take out the money. American dollars 
were hard currency in Jamaica, where imports were banned and everything was bought on the black 
market. Some of the bands were so keen to impress us that they brought their drums and guitars with 
them. Our room was soon full of tall Rastafarians wearing massive bobble hats in red, yellow and 
green stripes. One tall singer towered over us and sang lovingly about his spiritual homeland of 
Ethiopia.  
I watched Johnny as he sat on the sofa and nodded his head gently to th e music. It was difficult to 
believe that this was the same man, gaunt and thin as a lightning conductor, who had screeched abuse 
at everyone, spat at pictures of the Queen, and galvanised a generation of anger. Thinking about the 
Emperor Haile Selassie, w ho inspired the Rastafarians, I wondered whether the British royal family 
hadn’t  missed  a  trick.  
Over the course of a week we signed almost twenty reggae bands and found a couple more 
toasters, called Prince Far I and Tappa Zukie, into the bargain. I tried  to persuade Johnny Lydon to 
stay with The Sex Pistols but to no avail. He told me that the group had fallen out among themselves 
and with Malcolm McLaren; that Sid Vicious was in a tailspin, taking all kinds of drugs and growing 
violent with Nancy, his gi rlfriend. Johnny wanted to go solo, and he had a couple of musicians in 
mind to form a new band called PiL, Public Image Limited. I was sorry since I wanted to build The 
Sex Pistols as the next classic rock band to follow The Rolling Stones. After all, The  Rolling Stones 
had started off as the most shocking band in the world, with Mick Jagger being arrested for possessing 
drugs and scandalising public opinion. By 1978 The Stones had been going for more than fifteen years 
and they had become part of the rock  and  roll  Establishment.  And  they  didn’t  look  like  stopping.  
Coping with success obviously brings its own difficulties for a rock band, but getting your name 
into  people’s  minds  is  almost  the  hardest  thing  to  achieve.  The  Sex  Pistols  had  certainly  entered  the  
world’s  vocabulary   – if only as a byword for all that mos t people found revolting – and I felt that they 
were crazy to throw away that advantage. I tried to persuade Johnny that The Sex Pistols could use 
their name in slightly different ways, and perhaps move away from the extreme punk image they had 
made their own. I also wanted to push them overseas: Never Mind The Bollocks  had sold only 300,000 
records overseas, about the same number as it had sold in Britain, and I felt sure that they could do 
much  better  with  successive  albums.  After  Mike  Oldfield’s  instant   success and then his withdrawal 
from  public  life,  I  was  determined  that  The  Sex  Pistols  would  not  collapse  as  well.  They  were  Virgin’s  
top  band  and  they  had  been  the  catalyst  both  for  Virgin  Music’s  wider  success  and  a  whole  new  wave  
of rock music. But Joh nny was in no mood to listen.  On our final evening we found a Rasta bar up along the coast from Kingston which sold fish in 
strong jerk sauce. We sat outside watching the sea. A flock of pelicans were dive -bombing in 
formation, and we watched them methodic ally work their way through shoals of fish, each one peeling 
off and diving down, tucking in their wings before plunging into the water. We drank Red Stripe beer 
and listened to Bob Marley. Although I kept turning the conversation back to what The Sex Pist ols 
could do, Johnny was not really listening.  
There was a world of difference between Mike Oldfield and The Sex Pistols. But both of them 
had found that they could not cope with the pressures of fame. From my point of view, as the head of 
their record com pany, there was a further difference: Mike Oldfield had made Virgin Music a 
tremendous amount of money that we had spent building up the company and signing new acts. We 
would not be in business without him. Although The Sex Pistols had been number one wit h  ‘God  Save  
The  Queen’,  and  their  album,   Never Mind The Bollocks , had also been number one, Virgin had not 
made very much money from the group.  
As I sat there with Johnny Rotten on the Jamaican beach, I was forced to accept that Virgin 
would never make muc h more money from The Sex Pistols. Malcolm McLaren had arranged for The 
Sex Pistols to be in a film called The Great Rock And Roll Swindle , and I wondered whether there 
might be a soundtrack which we could release from that, but, otherwise, Simon, Ken and I were going 
to have to accept that from now on The Sex Pistols were not a going concern.  
Although it was highly frustrating to see them falling apart – and in a far worse way than Mike 
Oldfield, who continued to produce records which sold well – there was  some consolation in that, after 
we had signed The Sex Pistols, Virgin had become the smart record label for punk and new -wave 
bands to sign with. The music world had seen the promotion which we had put behind The Sex 
Pistols, and a whole new generation of  exciting bands was approaching us. Simon had picked up 
bands such as The Motors, XTC, The Skids, Magazine, Penetration and The Members which were all 
selling well, and another band called The Human League were building up a following. Virgin Music 
Publish ing had signed a schoolteacher from Newcastle called Gordon Sumner who used the stage 
name  ‘Sting’  and  sang  with  a  band  called  Last  Exit  who  were  thought  to  have  some  promise.  
I  returned  to  the  Kingston  Sheraton,  mulling  over  Virgin’s  prospects  without  The  Sex Pistols. 
There was a message from Joan, asking me to call her.  
‘Shall  we  meet  in  New  York?’  she  asked.  
I left Jamaica the next morning.  
 
 
 
 11 Living on the edge  
1978 –1980  
I MET JOAN IN  New York. Her attempt to patch up her marriage with Ronnie had failed . We spent a 
week in Manhattan and felt like refugees. My divorce from Kristen had yet to come through, and Joan 
had only days previously separated from Ronnie. We were thinking of escaping from New York to 
spend some time together alone, out of reach from  any telephone, when somebody asked me if I had 
named Virgin Music after the Virgin Islands. The answer was no – but they sounded like just the 
romantic haven that Joan and I needed.  
On impulse, Joan and I decided to fly down to the Virgin Islands. We had nowhere to stay and 
not very much money, but I heard that if you expressed a serious interest in buying an island the local 
estate agent would put you up for nothing in a grand villa and fly you all around the Virgin Islands by 
helicopter. This sounded rat her fun. I cheekily made a few calls, and, sure enough, when I introduced 
myself and mentioned The Sex Pistols and Mike Oldfield and that Virgin Music was really expanding 
and we wanted to buy an island where our rock stars could come and get away from it all, and perhaps 
put a recording studio there, the estate agent began to get very excited.  
Joan and I flew down to the Virgin Islands, where we were greeted like royalty and ushered into 
a sumptuous villa. The next day we were flown by helicopter all over the Virgin Islands as the estate 
agent showed us the islands that were for sale. We pretend ed we quite liked the first two islands we 
saw, but we asked him whether there were any more.  
‘There’s  one  more  which  is  a  real  little  jewel,’  he  said.  ‘It’s  being  sold  by  a  British  lord  who’s  
never  been  here.  It’s  called  Necker  Island,  but  I  don’t  think  i t’s  a  wise  idea  because  it’s  miles  from  
anywhere.’ 
That did it.  
‘All  right,’  I  said.  ‘Please  can  we  see  it?’  
As we flew to Necker Island, I looked down from the helicopter window and marvelled at the 
clear pale -blue sea. We landed on a white sandy beach.  
‘There’s  no  water  on  the  island,’  said  the  estate  agent.  ‘The  last  known  inhabitants  were  two  
journalists  who  came  here  on  a  survival  course.  They  radioed  for  help  before  the  week  was  out.  It’s  
the most beautiful island in the whole archipelago, but it need s  a  lot  of  money  spent  on  it.’  
There was a hill above the beach. Joan and I set off for the top, to get a view over the whole 
island. There were no paths, so by the time we reached the top our legs were scratched and bleeding 
from squeezing through the cac ti. But the view from the top was worth it: we saw the reef all around 
the island and noticed that the beach ran most of the way round the shoreline. The estate agent had 
told me that leather -backed turtles came up to lay their eggs on the beaches of Necke r. The water was 
so clear that we spotted a giant ray flapping its way serenely along the sandy bottom inside the reef. 
There were thousands of nesting gulls and terns, and a small flock of pelicans fishing in formation. 
Higher up, a frigate bird came glid ing past on an air current, its vast wings spread wide as it carved its way over the thermals. Looking inland, we saw two saltwater lakes and a small tropical forest. A flock 
of black parrots flew over the forest canopy. Looking across at the other islands , we could see only 
their green coastlines: there was not a single house in sight. We walked back down the hill to find the 
estate agent.  
‘How  much  does  he  want  for  it?’  I  asked.  
‘£3  million.’  
Our visions of watching the sunset from the top of the hill fad ed  away.  ‘Nice  thought,’  Joan  said,  
and we trudged back to the helicopter.  
‘How  much  were  you  thinking  of  spending?’  the  estate  agent  asked,  suddenly  smelling  a  rat.  
‘We  could  offer  £150,000,’  I  said  brightly.  ‘$200,000,’  I  added,  trying  to  make  it  sound  m ore. 
‘I  see.’ 
As we flew back to the villa, it was clear that we were no longer welcome. Talk of $200,000 
wasn’t  enough  to  secure  us  a  night  at  the  villa.  Our  bags  were  left  at  the  door,  and  Joan  and  I  hauled  
them across the village to a bed -and-breakfast.  It was clear that there were going to be no more 
helicopter flights over the islands. Yet Joan and I were determined to buy Necker. We felt that it could 
be our secret hideaway island, somewhere we could always retreat to. So, although we were 
practically  driven off the Virgin Islands as if we were cattle -rustlers, we vowed to return.  
Back in London, later, I found out that the owner of Necker Island wanted to sell in a hurry. He 
wanted to construct a building somewhere in Scotland which would cost him aro und £200,000. I 
upped my offer to £175,000 and held on for three months. Finally I got a call.  
‘If  you  offer  £180,000  it’s  yours.’  
There was never a hint that £180,000 was only a fraction of the £3 million asking price. So I 
agreed on the spot, and Necker Island was ours. Even at such a low price, there was a snag: the Virgin 
Islands’  government  had  decreed  that  whoever  bought  Necker  Island  would  have  to  develop  it  within  
five years or its ownership would pass to them. It would cost a good deal to build a h ouse and pipe the 
water across from the neighbouring island, but I wanted to go back there with Joan. I was determined 
to make enough money to afford it.  
Joan and I stayed on Beef Island for the rest of that holiday, and it was there that I set up Virgin 
Airways. We were trying to catch a flight to Puerto Rico, but the local Puerto Rican scheduled flight 
was cancelled. The airport terminal was full of stranded passengers. I made a few calls to charter 
companies, and agreed to charter a plane for $2,000 to P uerto Rico. I divided the price by the number 
of seats, borrowed a blackboard, and wrote VIRGIN AIRWAYS: $39 SINGLE  FLIGHT TO 
PUERTO RICO . I walked around the airport terminal and soon filled every seat on the charter plane. 
As we landed at Puerto Rico, a passenger turned to me and said:  
‘Virgin  Airways  isn’t  too  bad   – smarten  up  the  service  a  little  and  you  could  be  in  business.’  ‘I  might  just  do  that,’  I  laughed.  
‘Richard,  I  want  to  get  married  and  I  want  you  to  be  my  best  man,’  said  Mike  Oldfield.  
‘That’s  wonderful,’  I  said.  ‘Who  is  she?’  
‘She’s  the  daughter  of  my  therapy  teacher.’  
Mike Oldfield had been a lifelong introvert. In September 1976 he went on a therapy course in 
Wales; this seemed to involve being alternately humiliated and praised in front of  a group of people. 
To me, it sounded rather like a crash course in surviving public school or the army. But Mike emerged 
with his introversion banished. Within days he was posing for some nude photographs in the music 
press  as  Rodin’s   Le Penseur . And now he wanted to get married.  
‘How  long  have  you  known  her?’  I  asked.  
‘Three  days.’  
‘Don’t  you  want  to  wait?’  
‘I  can’t  wait,’  he  said.  ‘She  won’t  sleep  with  me  until  we’re  married.  It’s  tomorrow  at  Chelsea  
Register  Office.’  
Having failed to persuade him out of it, Joan and I went along to the register office and waited for 
Mike and his bride. We brought two carved African stools with us as wedding presents. We put them 
down  on  the  pavement  outside  and  sat  on  them  before  Mike’s  arrival.  A  stream  of  men  and women 
passed us and emerged as man and wife. As we sat and waited I could feel the whole idea of marriage 
becoming less and less appealing. Both Joan and I had suffered failed marriages, and the sight of this 
production line of wedded couples coming o ut every six and a half minutes from the register office 
and, in our jaundiced view, heading for the divorce lawyers put us off saying the vows to each other 
again.  They  seemed  to  ring  hollow.  I  knew  that  I  loved  Joan,  but  I  felt  we  didn’t  need  to  say  the  
clichéd words to confirm it.  
Mike and Sarah were married and we gave them the two African stools. We had dinner together 
that night, but the evening ended early since Mike was so clearly intent on getting Sarah into bed. The 
next morning the phone rang.  
‘Richard,  I  want  a  divorce.’  It  was  Mike.  
‘What’s  wrong?’  
‘We’re  not  compatible,’  Mike  said,  in  a  voice  which  brooked  no  further  questions.  
Mike and Sarah went more or less straight from the register office to the lawyers, and he ended 
up paying her over £ 200,000 in alimony. My mind boggles at what went on that night, but whatever 
happened it must go down as one of the most expensive one -night stands in history.  In 1977 Virgin as a whole made a pre -tax profit of £400,000; in 1978 the figure increased to £50 0,000. 
After the collapse of The Sex Pistols, we were left with a handful of our original artists, the most 
important being Mike Oldfield, whose albums sold consistently right the way through the advent of 
punk and new wave. We also had a couple of new sig nings, both of whom seemed rather esoteric and 
played synthesiser music: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and The Human League. While these 
two bands had yet to sell well, XTC, The Skids and Magazine kept their sales going. We also 
continued to sell well in France and Germany, particularly with Tangerine Dream.  
By 1979, an outsider might have looked at Virgin and come to the conclusion that it was a motley 
collection of different companies. From our tiny mews house in Vernon Yard, we operated the record 
shops, which Nik ran; the record company, which was run by Simon and Ken; and the music 
publishing company, which was run by Carol Wilson. The Manor was going well, and we had 
expanded our recording business with the purchase of a London recording studio. Th e original plan to 
set up everything that a rock star needed, recording, publishing, distribution, and retailing, was 
beginning to work. On top of this we had also set up Virgin Book Publishing, which was primarily to 
publish books about music, and biograp hies and autobiographies of the rock stars.  
In  lieu  of  The  Sex  Pistols’  future  albums,  which  would  now  never  be  made,  we  had  acquired  the  
rights to the film which Malcolm McLaren was producing, The Great Rock And Roll Swindle . This 
guaranteed one last albu m, the film soundtrack. In order to pull this film together, we set up Virgin 
Films, which Nik started to manage.  
Another venture that Nik had set up was The Venue, a nightclub where our bands could play and 
people could eat and socialise while watching th em. As the world of rock music grew increasingly 
sophisticated, it became clear that bands no longer wanted simply to record their songs and then 
release them. Pop videos were becoming the most effective way of promoting songs, and some cynics 
observed tha t pop videos were as important as the music itself. In order to accommodate this, Nik also 
set up a film -editing studio where our bands could make and edit their own videos.  
The other service that Virgin should offer our artists was the ability to sell the ir records overseas. 
Although we were a tiny company based in a mews house in Notting Hill, I knew that, if we had no 
overseas companies, we stood no chance of signing the international bands. One of the beauties of 
rock music is that at the top end of the  market it is a purely international commodity. The best measure 
of  a  group’s  success  is  how  many  records  they  sell  overseas.  The  large  multinational  companies  had  a  
huge advantage over Virgin or Island since, during the negotiation to sign a band, they co uld point to 
their sales forces in France and Germany.  
One option open to Virgin was not to compete with the multinationals overseas, but purely to 
concentrate on the domestic UK market and license our bands overseas in the same way in which we 
had license d Mike Oldfield when we first set up. Although this was a tempting option in that it saved 
overheads,  I  wasn’t  happy  with  it.  Island  and  Chrysalis  adopted  this  approach  and  I  felt  that  it  
restricted their growth because they were at the mercy of the overse as licensees. Once you have 
licensed a band away to another record company, you lose all control of their promotion. As well as 
wanting to control the prospects of our British bands overseas, we also wanted to be able to attract 
overseas bands to Virgin. W e wanted French, German and American bands to feel that they could sign 
with us for worldwide rights rather than with the large international record labels.  With a skeleton staff at Vernon Yard it was difficult to imagine that we could really take on the 
multinationals on their own terms. But we decided to give it a go. In 1978, Ken set off to New York to 
establish the Virgin label in America. Rather as Virgin had grown in London, proliferating itself in a 
number of small houses around Notting Hill, so I im agined that Virgin America would start off with a 
house in Greenwich Village, and then move slowly around the country buying houses in Chicago, Los 
Angeles,  San  Francisco  and  other  regional  centres,  so  that  we  didn’t  build  up  one  monolithic  head  
office.  
In 1979 I went to France to meet with Jacques Kerner, the French head of PolyGram. I did not 
know anybody in the French music industry and, although I was ostensibly seeing him with the idea of 
asking PolyGram to distribute Virgin records, I was really on th e lookout for somebody who could set 
up Virgin in France. Jacques Kerner introduced me to an intriguing -looking man called Patrick 
Zelnick  who  ran  PolyGram’s  record  side.  Patrick  had  a  vaguely  distracted  look  about  him  rather  like  
Woody Allen, with thick, wiry, unruly hair and heavy black -framed glasses. Patrick not only looked 
like Woody Allen, he behaved like him: when we first went out for lunch together, we spent four 
hours afterward trying to find out where he had parked his car. Patrick told me he had  watched 
Virgin’s  progress  with  interest.  He  had  first  tried  to  meet  us  when  we  had  a  stall  at  the  Cannes  Music  
Festival in 1974, but had only been able to find a sign saying GONE SKIING . Patrick had then started 
coming over to buy records at the Virgin Re cords shop on Oxford Street, and he loved Mike Oldfield 
and Tangerine Dream.  
Jacques Kerner was offering me £300,000 to license the entire Virgin catalogue in France, with a 
percentage of royalties on top. Since Virgin had little money at the time, and we had just taken on 
another loan to pay for Necker Island, the easy option would have been to accept it. But, instead of 
dutifully  taking  down  the  details  in  my  notebook,  I  wrote  down  ‘Patrick  Zelnick:  Virgin  France’.  I  
surprised Jacques Kerner by asking for  some time to think it over.  
After the meeting I thanked both men, and asked them to drop by and see me on the houseboat 
when they were next in London. The next month Patrick came to London and called me up. We had 
lunch on Duende , and I asked him whether he would leave PolyGram and set up Virgin as an 
independent subsidiary in France. I would give him complete independence to sign whichever French 
bands he liked. We worked out some rough figures on a piece of paper, and Patrick agreed to do it. He 
set up V irgin France with a friend of his, Philippe Constantine, who was a wild, ragged individual, on 
and off heroin but with excellent musical taste. While Patrick did the business, Philippe spent his time 
with all the bands.  
‘When  you’re  invited  for  dinner,’  Ja cques Kerner said in a reproachful phone call to me when 
Patrick  resigned,  ‘you’re  not  meant  to  walk  away  with  the  cutlery.’  
I apologised for poaching Patrick, but told Jacques that Patrick had made his own decision to set 
up Virgin. It was only after Patr ick had left PolyGram that we looked through the figures again and 
realised we had miscalculated: we had forgotten to include VAT in our estimations; we had used the 
wrong retail margin; we had hopelessly overestimated the numbers of records that were sold  in Paris. 
But by then it was too late: Patrick and Philippe were working for Virgin. One of the first bands they 
signed was called Telephone, who became the bestselling band of the year in France. In later years, 
Patrick would shake his head in disbelief that he had left the security of PolyGram and joined a 
virtually bust English record company.  While the negotiations with Patrick were going on, I went back to France to meet the managing 
director of Arista Records. We were unable to agree a distribution d eal, but I pricked up my ears when 
he  started  boasting  about  how  Arista  was  about  to  sign  Julien  Clerc,  France’s  biggest  pop  star.  I  had  
no  idea  who  Julien  Clerc  was,  but  I  excused  myself  and  slipped  into  the  lavatory.  I  scribbled  ‘Julien  
Claire’  on  my  wri st and then carefully pulled down the sleeve of my sweater to hide it. After the 
meeting was over I rushed to a call box and telephoned Patrick.  
‘Have  you  heard  of  a  singer  called  Julien  Claire?’  I  asked.  
‘Of  course  I  have,’  Patrick  said.  ‘He’s  the  biggest  star  in  France.’  
‘Well  he’s  free  to  sign.  Let’s  try  to  sign  him.  Can  we  meet  him  for  lunch  tomorrow?’  
At the lunch the next day, Patrick and I managed to persuade Julien Clerc to sign with Virgin 
from  under  Arista’s  nose.  Within  a  fortnight  I  had  succeede d in having my name struck off two record 
companies’  lunch  lists,  but  both  Patrick  and  Julien  Clerc  went  on  to  make  fortunes  for  Virgin  France  
and themselves.  
With Ken in New York, Patrick in Paris, Udo in Germany and our own operation in London, we 
could properly market Virgin as an international record label. Our trouble was that we had no cash 
reserves, and so any setback could prove fatal. When I visited Coutts Bank in the Strand I now wore 
shoes and my hair was in no danger of getting caught in the rev olving door, but they still treated me 
like  a  schoolboy  prodigy  rather  than  a  businessman.  Even  looking  at  Virgin’s  sales  of  £10  million,  
they would shake their heads and smile.  
‘It’s  all  good  pop  music,  isn’t  it?’  the  Coutts  manager  would  say  genially.  ‘M y son loves Mike 
Oldfield.  I  just  wish  my  other  one  didn’t  play  all  this  loud  punk  stuff.  I  keep  having  to  yell  up  at  him  
to  turn  it  down.’  
I tried to point out that Virgin was growing into a large company. We had very good sales, and 
were making as good a nd steady money as any regular business. But the bankers never saw it like that: 
‘You’re  doing  jolly  well,’  the  bank  manager  said.  ‘But  of  course  the  quality  of  your  earnings  is  so  
poor.  We  can’t  see  what  they’re  going  to  be  more  than  a  month  in  advance.’  
In spite of this cheerless analysis, at the end of 1978 we felt quite confident: in the UK we had 
enjoyed a good year, with a string of top -ten hits and good sales through the record shops. But in 1979 
Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister; interest  rates soared, and we were hit by a severe 
recession. Record sales in Britain dropped for the first time in twenty years, and our chain of shops 
lost  a  lot  of  money.  Ken  had  had  no  luck  in  New  York:  Virgin’s  first  single  there  cost  $50,000  to  
promote and c ompletely bombed. Reluctantly, we decided to close the office and called Ken back 
home.  
Everything seemed to be going wrong, even at home. In November 1979 Joan called me to say 
that the houseboat was in danger of sinking. I had left the water pump on and,  rather than pumping 
water out, it had backfired and started siphoning water in. We met at Duende  and waded around in the 
water trying to salvage furniture and boxes of files. After we had retrieved all we could, we stood on 
the towpath chatting to our nei ghbours about the best way to pull the boat up. One of the neighbours 
shifted a box, and to our embarrassment a large vibrator fell out. When it hit the ground, it turned itself on and started to vibrate. As we all watched it, it buzzed around and finally fell into the canal, where it 
zipped through the water like a torpedo before finally vanishing from view.  
‘Anything  to  do  with  you,  Richard?’  Joan  asked  caustically.  
‘No.  You?’ 
‘Of  course  not.’  
That box had (of course!) been on Duende  for years. The circle of ripples where the vibrator had 
sunk seemed a fitting end to the 1970s.  
In 1980 I travelled to Los Angeles to try to interest American record companies in English artists. The 
trip was a disaster. I took a collection of demo tapes b ut nobody was interested in anything new. Mike 
Oldfield was as popular as ever – someone  even  misspelt  his  name  ‘Oilfield’,  which  was  certainly  
closer to the truth for Virgin – but the other bands I was trying to license, such as The Skids, The 
Motors, XTC ,  Japan,  Orchestral  Manoeuvres  in  the  Dark  (‘Hang  on,  Richard,’  said  the  buyer  at  CBS.  
‘We  haven’t  got  all  day.  Can’t  we  just  call  them  OMD?’),  and  The  Flying  Lizards,  were  listened  to  
with polite interest but few bids.  
As  I  saw  that  Virgin’s  income  was  dr ying up, I made continual lists of savings we could make. I 
sold Denbigh Terrace, and put the money into Virgin; we sold two flats we owned in Vernon Yard; we 
cut back on everything we could think of. I recently came across a list of immediate priorities o f the 
time in my notebook. It brings back the sense of desperation:  
  
1. Remortgage the Manor  
2. Turn off the swimming -pool heater  
3. Sign Japan [the band]  
4. Sell the houses in Vernon Yard  
5. Ask Mike Oldfield if we can hold back his cash  
6. Sell the houseboat  
7. Sell my car  
8. Lease all the recording equipment  
9. Nik could sell his shares to a merchant bank or Warner Bros  10. Sell The Venue  
I wrote to the Virgin staff and told them that we had to tighten our belts urgently:  
  
The  good  news  is  that  Ian  Gillan’s  new  record  has  gone  strai ght in at number three in the charts. 
But  the  bad  news  is  that  it’s  only  sold  70,000  copies,  which  is  just  a  half  of  what  a  number -three 
record would have been last year. Our profits have been reduced by more than half since we have 
the same overheads.  
By Nik’s  calculations  Virgin  was  heading  for  a  £1  million  loss  in  1980.  
‘I  can’t  sell  my  shares  to  a  merchant  bank,’  he  told  me.  ‘Virgin  is  losing  £1  million  this  year.  The  
shares  are  worthless.’  
‘But  what  about  the  brand  name?’  I  asked.  
‘“Virgin"?  It’s  worth  minus  £1  million,’  he  said.  ‘They  won’t  recognise  any  value  in  the  brand  
name.  What’s  the  worth  of  British  Leyland  as  a  brand  name?’  
Virgin was suddenly in desperate trouble. The 1980 recession caught us with all the unexpected 
ferocity of a squall at sea . For the second time we had to make some staff redundant: nine people, who 
represented a sixth of the worldwide staff of Virgin Music. This was proportionately less than the cuts 
being made by other record companies at the time, but it was a gut -wrenching  blow for us. Nik, 
Simon, Ken and I spent hours arguing over what we should do. With no major rock star on the roster 
to release a hit record, Virgin had no predictable future income. We found ourselves desperately 
fighting to try to prove Coutts Bank wron g. Once again we went through our catalogue of bands and 
made several cuts. We had to abandon most of the reggae bands we had signed in Jamaica since a 
military coup in Nigeria had banned all imports and destroyed our sales.  
Tension rose between Nik and Si mon as they argued over which bands Virgin should keep. Nik 
argued that Virgin should drop The Human League, a young band from Sheffield who played 
synthesisers.  
‘Over  my  dead  body,’  Simon  told  him.  
‘But  they’re  so  marginal,’  Nik  argued.  ‘We  can’t  afford  t o  keep  supporting  them.’  
‘The  Human  League  is  exactly  why  I’m  in  this  business,’  Simon  said,  fighting  to  keep  his  
temper.  
‘You  just  spend  all  the  money  I  save  in  the  shops,’  Nik  said,  wagging  his  finger  in  Simon’s  face.  
‘Look  here,’  Simon  snapped,  rising  t o  his  feet.  ‘Never,  ever,  wag  that  fucking  finger  in  my  face  
again.  And  The  Human  League  are  staying.’  I watched Simon and Nik fight it out, knowing that something would have to be done. Nik had 
been my main partner, my closest childhood friend, and we had  worked together since Student , when 
we were sixteen. But he was obsessed with cutting back and saving money, though, admittedly, at a 
time when we were in deep trouble. But once again I felt that unless we did something dramatic, 
which meant spending mone y, we would never get out of trouble.  
Nik  and  Simon  reached  an  angry  stalemate  and  turned  to  me  to  arbitrate  between  them.  To  Nik’s  
fury, I backed Simon. This was a turning point in the triangular relationship which had worked so well 
up to this point. I f elt  that  Simon’s  taste  in  music  was  the  only  thing  that  could  pull  Virgin  out  of  the  
hole  we  were  in.  Without  Simon’s  new  generation  of  bands,  we  would  be  stuck  treading  water.  Nik  
thought that we were throwing good money after bad, and he went back to the  record shops 
determined to squeeze even more savings out of them.  
At another meeting we argued over a new signing, the drummer from Genesis. In September 
1980, Simon wanted to spend £65,000 to sign up Phil Collins as a solo artist. Once again Simon was 
supremely confident that this was the right move, and he stood up to all the doubts and criticisms Nik 
threw at him. The reason we even had the chance to sign Phil Collins was our expansion into the 
recording -studio business. As well as the Manor, we had acquired a studio in West London which we 
called the Town House. At th e back of the Town House we had built a second studio, which was hired 
out at a lower rate. Rather than having the normal padded walls to kill all acoustic reverberations, we 
had built it with stone walls. When Phil Collins wanted to record some solo mater ial he decided that 
he  couldn’t  afford  the  top -of-the-range studio, so he booked the Stone Wall studio instead. There he 
found  he  managed  to  get  the  most  extraordinary  recordings  of  his  drumming  for  ‘In  The  Air  Tonight’.  
It sounded fantastic. And Phil got on so well with the sound engineers that soon he found himself 
talking to Simon, and before we knew what had happened he was ready to sign up with us.  
Nik made Simon do all kinds of sales analysis to try to work out how many copies of a solo 
album by Phil we could sell. Nik was worried that Genesis fans would not buy him, but Simon proved 
that,  even  if  just  10  per  cent  of  known  Genesis  fans  bought  Phil’s  debut  solo  album,  we  would  make  
money. As we stared with dismay at our overdraft and the wretchedly low sales figures of our other 
bands, we knew the gamble we were making. To his credit, Nik agreed that we should sign Phil 
Collins, even taking money from the shop tills to make up enough for the advance. Phil proved to be 
an extraordinarily gifted musician a nd singer. His voice was haunting and his lyrics poignant: he was 
destined to become more successful than Genesis itself.  
In the meantime, New Musical Express  mentioned that Virgin Music was in financial trouble. If 
Coutts read NME , which I doubted, they m ight think twice about extending the loan I wanted. I 
immediately  tried  to  squash  the  idea  with  a  letter  to  the  editor:  ‘Since  in  your  last  issue  you  speculate  
that I am in deep financial trouble you will appreciate my need to sue you in order to acquire s ome 
interest -free  money  rather  than  approach  the  merchant  banks  …’  Although   New Musical Express  was 
hardly the Financial Times , I recognised that if rumours like that are not hit hard on the head they 
have a horrible habit of becoming self -perpetuating. Wo rse still, they were true.  
A couple of months after the arguments over The Human League and Phil Collins, I came across 
two deals that I thought were irresistible. They both involved nightclubs. The first one was The Roof 
Garden in Kensington, which was be ing offered for sale at £400,000. Virgin of course had no money, 
but the brewer who supplied beer to The Roof Garden was prepared to offer us an interest -free loan if we continued to stock their wines, beers and spirits. The other nightclub was Heaven, a l arge gay 
nightclub under Charing Cross Station. The owner was a friend of my sister Vanessa and he wanted to 
sell it to someone who would respect it and keep it as a gay club. Through my work at the Advisory 
Centre, he knew that he could trust me to do thi s. His asking price was £500,000 and once again the 
brewer was prepared to give us an interest -free loan to cover the entire purchase price, in return for 
stocking their beers. I had no idea why the brewers did not want to acquire these clubs outright, and  I 
jumped at the chance to buy them.  
I knew that Nik would oppose these purchases, so I signed the contracts without telling him. He 
was furious. He thought that I was squandering money. He looked at the £1 million extra liability 
which the purchase of the se clubs represented and thought that I was ruining Virgin.  
‘It’ll  sink  us,’  he  argued.  
‘But  we  don’t  have  to  pay  any  interest,’  I  said.  ‘It’s  free  money.  When  someone  offers  you  a  
Rolls -Royce  for  the  price  of  a  Mini  you  have  to  take  it.’  
‘There’s  no  such   thing  as  a  free  lunch  and  there’s  no  such  thing  as  free  money,’  Nik  told  me.  ‘It’s  
still  debt.  We  can’t  possibly  pay  it  off.  We’re  practically  bust  as  it  is.’  
‘This  money  is  free,’  I  said.  ‘And  I  think  there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  free  lunch.  We’ll  trade  out  of 
trouble.’ 
Nik disagreed with me so vehemently that it became clear we had to go our separate ways. He 
thought that I was leading Virgin headlong into bankruptcy. He wanted to protect the remaining value 
of his 40 per cent share of the business before i t was too late. For my part, in spite of our history, I had 
been unhappy with our professional relationship for two or three years. Nik and I had always been best 
friends but, as Virgin had grown bigger and moved from being a record retailer to a music lab el, I felt 
that he had become out of his depth. Nik thought that we were all out of our depths, which we may 
well   have   been.   There   was   no   room   for   him   in   the   record   label,   and   in   any   event   he   wasn’t  
comfortable doing all the socialising with the musicians which Simon, Ken and I did. I rather 
suspected  that  Nik’s  puritanical  outlook  made  him  resent  every  pound  that  was  thrown  away  on  
ordering another bottle of champagne, even if by charming and so winning the band on to Virgin 
Music we would reap vast benefi ts. I felt that Nik was always trying to stop me doing the things I 
wanted to do, most of which, admittedly, involved risking money on new bands. It is probably an 
interesting  litmus  test  of  our  relationship  that  I  don’t  think  Nik  came  on  staff  skiing  holi days after 
about  1977.  I  have  always  wanted  the  Virgin  staff  to  have  a  great  time,  and  I’ll  be  the  first  one  to  
make  a  fool  of  myself  in  any  way  if  I  think  that  it’ll  help  the  party  go  with  a  swing.  Nik  found  all  that  
side of life difficult to enjoy. We kn ew  each  other  so  well  we  could  write  pages  about  each  other’s  
good and bad points. In the end we both realised that it was best to separate while we were still 
friends. That way we could remain friends, rather than waiting until we had grown into implacabl e 
enemies.  
I  raised  another  loan  from  another  bank,  and  bought  out  Nik’s  shareholding  in  Virgin.  As  well  as  
this cash, Nik also took with him some of his favourite parts of the Virgin Group: the Scala cinema 
and the film - and video -editing  studios.  Nik’s  r eal interest lay in the film world, and when he left he 
set up Palace Pictures with a view to making movies. With his talent he soon started making wonderful films such as The Company of Wolves, Mona Lisa  and the Oscar -winning The Crying 
Game . 
With our sep aration settled, Nik and I hugged each other and made up. We had both got what we 
wanted,  and  to  celebrate  our  ‘divorce’  we  threw  a  leaving  party  at  The  Roof  Garden.  In  many  ways  we  
managed to get the best of both worlds: we remained great friends, saw a l ot of each other, and both 
managed  to  thrive  without  the  other.  Although  I  had  acquired  Nik’s  40  per  cent  of  Virgin,  I  was  well  
aware that there was no difference between owning 100 per cent and 60 per cent of a busted company. 
Nik  was  right  about  Virgin’s  trading losses for 1980: we lost £900,000.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12 ‘Success  can  take  off  without  warning.’  
1980 –1982  
AS WELL AS PARTING  from Nik, I came dangerously close to splitting up with Joan in 1980. I was 
working frantically to keep Virgin afloat and I knew that Joan was growing increasingly frustrated. No 
matter how late I got home, the telephone rang. Every time we woke up on a Sa turday morning it rang 
again. One night I returned home to the houseboat to find it empty. Joan had gone and left me a note: 
‘I  am  pregnant.  I  am  afraid  to  tell  you.  I  have  run  away  from  home.  If  you  miss  me,  call  me  at  Rose’s.’  
As I looked at the note, I realised that my life had changed. I sat down and thought about what to 
do. After Kristen had left me, I had had a number of affairs. I loved the variety and the freedom. Ever 
since she had moved in with me, I feared I had taken Joan too much for granted. My marriage to 
Kristen had made me sceptical about long -term relationships, and at that time I had not made the same 
commitment as Joan. I was also under pressure from my parents to get back together with Kristen or, 
if not, then to marry some kind of univ ersity -educated, tennis -playing girl from Surrey – which Joan 
emphatically was not.  
I remember telling my parents that Joan had moved in with me. Dad was fishing on the shore of a 
lake, and Mum was pointing out a rising trout.  
In the ensuing silence Dad fl unked his cast, which landed in a tangle.  
‘That’s  torn  it,’  he  said.  
But  when  I  sat  in  the  houseboat  holding  Joan’s  scribbled  note  and  thinking  about  our  unborn  
baby, I realised that I really loved her. Until that moment I had been guilty of wanting to hav e my cake 
and eat it: having a great relationship without making a commitment to it. I had enjoyed a number of 
different relationships, and had never thought about the consequences. I think lots of men would 
happily drift through life without having childr en unless their partners forced the issue. I called Rose, 
Joan’s  sister,  and  dashed  round  to  be  with  Joan.  
About  six  months  into  Joan’s  pregnancy  I  was  in  France  while  Joan  was  on  holiday  in  Scotland.  
She had an attack of appendicitis in Fort William. I fl ew to Scotland to be with her while she was 
having the operation. In fact, she did not have appendicitis but an ovarian cyst which had burst, but the 
doctors decided to go ahead and remove her appendix as well – a dangerous operation at the best of 
times b ut more so on a six -months -pregnant woman. The operation triggered Joan into labour. She 
was put on a drip to try to reduce the contractions, and we immediately set off in an ambulance to try 
to reach a more modern hospital at Inverness. The drive across S cotland in the snow was a nightmare. 
Every jolt of the road set Joan into further contractions. By the time we arrived she was in agony with 
the pain of the operation, the pain of the contractions, and desperately trying to keep the baby in.  
At Inverness H ospital it became clear that Joan would have to give birth to the baby. There was 
going to be little chance of the baby surviving as it was three months premature. A baby girl was born 
who weighed just four pounds, and we called her Clare after my aunt. Cl are could scarcely feed and 
the hospital did not have the necessary equipment to keep her alive.  Although Clare did open her lovely, deep milky -blue eyes, she died after four days. All I can 
remember of her now is her tiny size. Neither of us was allowed t o hold or touch her. Her brief home 
was in an incubator. She was so small she would have fitted into the palm of my hand. We pored over 
her face, and marvelled at her tiny hands and the determined set to her face as she slept. But now that 
memory has faded . When I try to remember Clare, my mind is cluttered by the antiseptic smell of the 
hospital,  the  metal  chairs  in  our  room  scraping  over  the  lino,  and  the  look  on  the  nurse’s  face  as  she  
came to tell us that Clare had died.  
Clare inhabited a world of her o wn, and came in and out of our lives leaving only despair and 
emptiness and love behind her. She was so small and lived for so little time that she was almost never 
here at all, but in that heartbreaking time she brought Joan and me intensely close togethe r. Until I had 
seen  Clare’s  tiny  fragile  body,  dwarfed  by  the  tiniest  nappy,  and  seen  how  beautiful  she  was,  and  
known that she was our baby, I had never thought I would want to have a child.  
After  Clare’s  death,  Joan  and  I  were  determined  to  have  another   baby, and to our delight Joan 
became pregnant again within a year.  
Once again Joan went into labour early, this time by six weeks. Both of us were taken by 
surprise. I was at a party at The Venue and arrived home at three in the morning, roaring drunk. I f ell 
into a deep sleep, and only reluctantly woke when I felt Joan slapping me about the face and shouting 
that she was having contractions. I fell out of bed and managed to drive her to hospital. The doctors 
examined Joan and led her to the maternity ward.  ‘You  look  fine,’  they  reassured  her.  
Then they looked at me.  
‘You  look  terrible.  You’d  better  take  these  aspirins  and  go  to  bed.’  
Some time later that morning, I was woken up to find four doctors peering at me through their 
masks. I assumed that I had had a terrible accident and was in a casualty ward somewhere.  
‘Joan  is  well  into  labour,’  they  said.  ‘You’d  better  come  with  us.’  
Holly was born, under six pounds in weight. It was the most incredible experience I had ever 
been through. By the end of it (I believe!) I was even more exhausted than Joan. I pledged to myself 
that  I’d  never  miss  the  birth  of  one  of  our  children.  However,  aft er what had happened to Clare, our 
immediate concern was keeping Holly alive.  
We drove back to the houseboat on a freezing -cold November morning in 1981, and Joan 
wrapped Holly up with her in bed. For the rest of the winter they stayed more or less in the bedroom 
the whole time while I worked in the room next door. Penni used to walk through the bedroom to her 
desk, which was tucked between the bilge pump and the stairs.  
In 1981 Virgin Music finally began to earn some money. Japan had had hit albums with Gentlemen 
Take Polaroids  and Tin Drum .  Some  of  our  recent  hit  singles  were  XTC’s  ‘Generals  And  Majors’  and  
‘Sgt  Rock’,  and  Ian  Gillan’s  ‘Trouble’  and  ‘New  Orleans’.  The  Professionals  and  The  Skids  were  also  
successes.  We  still  didn’t  know  what  Phil  Collins  w ould come up with, and – twenty -fourth in my list 
of things to do that month – I arranged to go up to Scotland to a concert by one of our new bands, 
Simple  Minds.  Simple  Minds’  album,   New Gold Dream , was a bestseller.  The  best  news  of  1981  was  that  Simon’s  prediction about The Human League was proved right. 
Their first two albums were quite experimental and built up a loyal cult following. When we noticed 
that their sales kept steadily rising we knew that we had every chance of breaking through. Their third  
album, Dare , powered into the top ten and then went to number one. Dare  sold over 1 million copies 
in  Britain  and  3  million  around  the  world.  The  hit  single  ‘Don’t  You  Want  Me,  Baby?’  was  played  
over  and  over  again  and  became  ingrained  on  everyone’s  mind.  
Almost  as  quickly  as  they  had  run  out,  Virgin’s  cash  balances  were  now  restored.  Whenever  
Virgin has money I always renew my search for new opportunities. I am continually trying to broaden 
the Group so we are not dependent on a narrow source of income, b ut I suspect this is more down to 
inquisitiveness and restlessness than sound financial sense. This time I thought I saw a perfect 
opportunity. Since Virgin was an entertainment company, I thought we could publish our own listings 
magazine called Event . Unfortunately, it was launched at the same time as the highly successful Time 
Out, and Event  lost the battle.  
It is always difficult to admit to a failure, but the one positive thing about the Event  episode was 
that I realised how important it was to separat e the various Virgin companies so that, if one failed, it 
would not threaten the rest of the Virgin Group. Event  was a disaster, but it was a contained disaster. 
Every successful businessman has failed at some ventures, and most entrepreneurs who run their  own 
companies have been declared bankrupt at least once. Rather than defaulting on our debts, we paid 
them up and shut down the magazine.  
The money that Event  magazine lost Virgin was rapidly repaid to us by The Human League, 
Simple  Minds,  Phil  Collins’  e normously successful debut solo album, Face Value , and then, most 
spectacularly, by a young singer who called himself Boy George.  
I first heard of Boy George and Culture Club after Simon went to see them perform at a recording 
studio in Stoke Newington in 1981. The music publishing rights had already been signed by Virgin, 
and Simon was intrigued by the startling appearance of their lead singer, a beautiful young drag queen, 
and the soft, easy -going white reggae they played. Simon invited the band back to V ernon Yard, 
where they agreed a recording contract.  
When  Simon  introduced  me  to  George  O’Dowd,  I  found  myself  shaking  hands  with  somebody  
who looked utterly unlike anyone I had ever met before. His long hair was braided like a Rastafarian; 
he had a pale wh ite face, huge arched eyebrows, and wore the ornate robes of a geisha girl.  
Although  we  knew  that  Culture  Club  was  an  extraordinary  creation,  their  first  single,  ‘White  
Boy’,  was  stillborn.  Virgin  released  it  on  30  April  1982  but  nothing  much  happened:  it   sold around 
8,000  copies  and  reached  114  in  the  charts.  We  didn’t  mind.  We  really  felt  that,  as  soon  as  Boy  
George was properly photographed or if we could get him on to Top of the Pops , his records would 
take off. People just had to see Boy George and the y would want to buy his music. Teenagers would 
go mad for him. As well as looking astonishing, George had a fabulous voice and was very witty and 
charming: he was a rebel in a totally different way from The Sex Pistols or James Dean, but a rebel 
nonetheles s.  Virgin  brought  out  Culture  Club’s  second  single,  ‘I’m  Afraid  Of  Me’,  in  June,  and  
although  it  sold  better  than  ‘White  Boy’  it  still  only  reached  100  in  the  charts.  Culture  Club  carried  on  
recording their album, Kissing To Be Clever , which they had largely written before they signed with 
us. When  we  released  Culture  Club’s  third  single,  ‘Do  You  Really  Want  To  Hurt  Me?’,  on  3  
September 1982 it was our final attempt to launch the band. Funnily enough, Radio 2 played the song 
before Rad io  1,  and  general  reviews  of  the  single  were  poor:  ‘Watered -down fourth -division  reggae,’  
wrote Smash Hits .  ‘Awful.’  But  with  the  Radio  2  exposure  it  crept  up  the  charts,  up  to  number  85  in  
its first week, and number 38 in its second week. We plugged him a s hard as we could, but the BBC 
refused  to  interview  Boy  George,  calling  him  a  ‘transvestite’.  Then  we  heard  about  a  cancellation  on  
Top of the Pops . We did everything we could to get Boy George into that slot, and when Top of the 
Pops  finally agreed, we s uspected we had a sensation in the making.  
With his white face, his swaying robes, his felt hat and impossible arched eyebrows, Boy George 
beat every other sophisticated romantic band, such as Spandau Ballet, at their own game. He appealed 
to all teenagers , both male and female, as well as to children as young as eight or nine and their 
grandmothers to boot. It was impossible to define why he was so popular: parents wanted to mother 
him; girls wanted to be as beautiful; boys wanted their girlfriends to be a s  beautiful;;  it’s  impossible  to  
quantify. The next day the telephones rang off the desks and the orders for the single came pouring in. 
‘Do  You  Really  Want  To  Hurt  Me?’  rose  to  number  three.  George  then  appeared  on   Noel  Edmonds’  
Late Late Breakfast Show  and  Noel  asked  him  whether  he  was  a  great  fan  of  Liberace.  ‘Not  any  
more,’  George  said,  implying  that  the  roles  had  now  been  reversed.  The  single  reached  number  one.  
When George announced that he preferred a cup of tea to sex, he became an international icon . 
For  Christmas  1982,  we  released  Culture  Club’s  first  album,   Kissing To Be Clever , which sold 4 
million copies around the world. And then came another amazing breakthrough: their sixth single, 
‘Karma  Chameleon’,  was  the  top -selling single of 1983, selling  over 1.4 million copies in the UK and 
reaching number one in every country around the world that had a chart, over thirty countries to our 
knowledge. Culture Club was a worldwide pop phenomenon, and their second album, Colour By 
Numbers , sold almost 10 mi llion copies.  
Virgin’s  finances  were  thrown  upside  down:  from  the  £900,000  loss  in  1980,  we  made  a  profit  of  
£2 million in 1982 on sales of £50 million. In 1983 our sales shot up to £94 million and our profits 
soared to £11 million. Once we had started the  Boy George fan club, it was impossible to control it, 
and in 1983 40 per cent of our profits came from Boy George. For the first two years the Culture Club 
story was the perfect model. The extraordinary thing about the record industry is how success can t ake 
off without warning. One minute nobody had heard of Boy George; the next minute every person 
around  the  world  from  Ireland  to  Korea  and  Japan  to  Ghana  was  humming  ‘Karma  Chameleon’.  Boy  
George’s  success  was  measured  literally  by  the  speed  of  sound.  Man y people find such a vertical run 
frightening, and they would be right in thinking it creates havoc in a company. Happily, I have always 
thrived on havoc and adrenaline, and so I felt perfectly at home as we fanned the flames of Culture 
Club’s  success.  
 
 
 
 13 ‘You  go  ahead  with  this  over  my  dead  body.’  
1983 –1984  
IT IS ALWAYS EASIER  to live with the benefit of hindsight. People often point out that Nik sold his 
40 per cent stake in Virgin at the wrong time. But when Nik and I split up he was as aware of the sale s 
figures and profit forecast as I was and things were in bad shape. At the time Nik and I were both 
happy: Nik was happy to leave a company that looked as if it was heading into trouble, and I was 
happy to have virtually full control of my destiny, even i f I knew that Virgin was on a knife edge. 
Soon after Nik left, two things happened that could not have been foreseen. Firstly, compact discs 
became widespread and so we were able to resell our back catalogue on CD. Many people replicated 
their entire recor d collection on compact disc, and certainly an artist like Mike Oldfield sold 
tremendously well on CD; The Sex Pistols less so.  
The second change was that Virgin itself became the undisputed leading independent record 
label.  Simon’s  taste  in  music  finally   triumphed: Virgin Music started to dominate the top -ten singles 
and albums charts. From being seen as a one -band record label that had made an incongruous leap 
from Mike Oldfield to The Sex Pistols, Virgin Music was now the envy of the record industry. All  
Simon’s  signings  of  the  last  couple  of  years  took  off  at  once:  we  had  The  Human  League  as  well  as  
their spin -off, Heaven 17; Simple Minds; Boy George; Phil Collins; China Crisis and Japan. The 
wonderful thing about these artists was that we had broken the m all ourselves. I was still determined 
to sign a classic act of the calibre of Bryan Ferry or The Rolling Stones, but the beauty of our roster 
was that it was all home -grown, and was finally beginning to sell well overseas.  
As I watched the money pouring into the bank, I began to think of other ways to use it. Although 
I was closely involved in signing bands, I felt that I knew as much as I wanted to about negotiating 
record contracts. I needed another challenge. I had the opportunity to use our cash to se t up more 
Virgin companies and widen the basis of the Group so that all our eggs would not be in one basket if 
we were hit by another recession. I also wanted to expand the Virgin name to stand for more than a 
record label, and become more involved in all kinds of media. It was only three years since Virgin had 
almost gone bust, and two years since Nik had left. From having had very little money with which to 
play over the last three years, I now had cash mounting up in the bank and I wanted to reinvest it as 
fast as possible.  
When I began looking for other businesses to start up, I thought about expanding our tiny book -
publishing business. I knew that the music -publishing side of Virgin Music made a very good living 
from publishing the music and collecting royalties, and I wondered whether a properly managed book -
publishing division would be as successful. At the back of my mind was the thought that, if a rock star 
is famous, there should be all sorts of other activities that they could explore, including bo oks and 
videos, appearances in films, and soundtracks.  
Vanessa, my younger sister, had been going out with Robert Devereux since he was at 
Cambridge University. Robert had become part of the family. Although Virgin is not a family 
company in the traditiona l sense, in that it has not been passed down vertically from generation to 
generation, it is a family company in a horizontal sense, in that I always involve my wider family in 
whatever  I  do,  and  I  listen  to  their  opinions  as  closely  as  anyone  else’s.  I  kn ow that a number of 
businessmen shut their families off from their work: they hardly ever invite their children into their office, and when they are at home they never discuss what they do at work. It is a British characteristic 
not to discuss money over a  meal, but when this boils over into never discussing business then I think 
it represents a lost opportunity. Business is a way of life. It is small wonder that there are so few 
business entrepreneurs when business is excluded from the family circle.  
When I was wondering what to do about Virgin Books, Vanessa suggested that I talk to Robert, 
who had been working at Macmillan Publishers for three years. Robert came around to Duende  with 
his boss Rob Shreeve, and I asked them whether they would come and work at Virgin Books. I had no 
clear idea what Virgin Books should do, apart from somehow exploit the growing success of the 
Virgin rock stars. Robert suggested that books and videos could be sold through the same outlets, and 
he had the idea that Virgin Books could form part of a wider Virgin interest in the media, which could 
involve television, radio, films and videos as well as books. Undaunted by the reality that he was 
actually joining a tiny little publisher, Robert left his job and came to join us at Vir gin. Rob Shreeve 
decided to stay at Macmillan for the time being.  
When Robert arrived at Virgin Books he immediately put a stop to the line of novels we were 
selling. He recast Virgin Books as a nonfiction specialist in books about rock music and sport. A few 
years later he decided to buy another publishing house, WH Allen, which he put together with Virgin 
Books. With hindsight, this was a mistake: we tried to do too much, and in 1989 the publishing 
business ran into difficulties and had to be radically cu t back. It was one of our early acquisitions, and 
it gave us first -hand experience of all the pain that comes with laying off staff in order to turn a 
company round. It also demonstrated the benefits of growing a company from scratch, when you 
employ exact ly those people you want, and really establish the kind of atmosphere you want.  
A year later, Rob Shreeve joined Virgin Books as managing director, with Robert as chairman. 
Together they relaunched the business as Virgin Publishing, concentrating on our co re strengths of 
music and entertainment. Within a few years the company had become a highly successful publisher 
of  books  on  entertainment,  and  probably  the  world’s  leading  publisher  of  books  on  popular  music.  
In February 1984 a young American lawyer called Randolph Fields asked me whether I was interested 
in operating an airline. Randolph was looking for investors to finance a new airline that would use the 
Gatwick to New York route, which had become vacant fol lowing  the  collapse  of  Sir  Freddie  Laker’s  
airline in 1982. He sent me a proposal which I took up to read at Mill End. It was obvious that he had 
contacted lots of other investors before me – a record -label owner is hardly going to be his first call – 
so as  I  skimmed  through  the  proposal  I  kept  saying  to  myself,  ‘Don’t  get  tempted;;  don’t  even  think  
about  it.’ 
In the same way that I tend to make up my mind about people within thirty seconds of meeting 
them, I also make up my mind about whether a business pro posal excites me within about thirty 
seconds of looking at it. I rely far more on gut instinct than researching huge amounts of statistics. 
This might be because, due to my dyslexia, I distrust numbers, which I feel can be twisted to prove 
anything. The id ea of operating a Virgin airline grabbed my imagination, but I had to work out in my 
own mind what the potential risks were.  
Throughout  that  weekend  I  mulled  over  the  proposal.  Randolph’s  idea  was  to  offer  an  all -
business -class  airline,  but  this  didn’t  app eal. I worried about what would happen on the days when 
businessmen  don’t  fly:  Christmas,  Easter,  Bank  holidays,  the  entire  Thanksgiving  week.  I  thought  that  we would have to have holiday -makers to fill the plane in those weeks. If we were going to be 
different from other airlines, with their first, business and economy classes, perhaps we could offer 
just  two  classes:  business  and  economy?  I  wondered  what  the  implications  of  that  would  be.  We’d  get  
both businessmen and tourists – who would we miss? I wrote  out a list of things I wanted to 
understand about how the aircraft leasing would work. If I could lease the plane for one year and then 
have the chance to return the plane, we would have a clear escape route if it all failed. It would be 
embarrassing, but  we would limit the amount of money we lost. By the end of the weekend I had 
made up my mind: if we could limit everything to one year – the employment contracts, the leasing of 
the aircraft, the exchange exposure, and anything else that starting up a New York route involved – 
then I wanted to have a shot at it.  
The only airline that was offering cheap fares across the Atlantic in 1984 was People Express. I 
picked up the phone and tried to call them. Their number was engaged. It was impossible to get 
throug h on their reservations line all morning. I reasoned that either People Express was very poorly 
managed, in which case they would be an easy target for new competition, or that they were so much 
in demand that there was room for new competition. It was tha t continual engaged tone on my 
telephone throughout Saturday more than anything else which triggered my belief that we could set up 
and run an airline.  
I called up Simon on Sunday evening.  
‘What  do  you  think  about  starting  an  airline?’  I  jauntily  asked  him .  ‘I’ve  got  a  proposal  here   –’ 
‘For  God’s  sake!’  he  cut  across  me.  ‘You’re  crazy.  Come  off  it.’  
‘I’m  serious.’  
‘You’re  not,’  he  said.  ‘You’re  mad.’  
‘OK,’  I  said.  ‘I  won’t  go  into  it  now.  But  I  think  we  should  have  lunch.’  
On Monday morning I called up inte rnational directory inquiries and asked for the number for 
Boeing.  Boeing  is  based  in  Seattle,  and  due  to  the  time  difference  I  couldn’t  speak  to  them  until  late  
that afternoon. They were rather bemused to hear an Englishman asking what kinds of deals were  
available on a jumbo. I spent all afternoon and all evening on the phone to Boeing, and eventually I 
spoke to someone who could help me. They told me that Boeing did lease aircraft, and that they had a 
second -hand jumbo that they would seriously consider taking  back  after  a  year  if  things  didn’t  work  
out. With this extremely basic, not to say sketchy, information I prepared to face Simon and Ken.  
The lunch the next day was not a success. After I told them about how impossible it had been to 
get through to People Express and that Boeing had planes to lease, they looked shocked. I think they 
realised I had done all the market research I felt I needed to do and had made up my mind. They were 
right: I had worked myself up into a state about it.  
‘You’re  a  megalo maniac,  Richard,’  Simon  said.  ‘We’ve  been  friends  since  we  were  teenagers,  
but  if  you  do  this  I’m  not  sure  that  we  can  carry  on  working  together.  What  I’m  telling  you  is  that  you  
go  ahead  with  this  over  my  dead  body.’  Ken was less outspoken, but he too tho ught that the idea of combining a record company with an 
airline was anathema.  
‘I  can’t  see  the  connection,’  he  said.  ‘And,  if  you’re  looking  for  losses  to  offset  against  our  
profits,  we  could  always  invest  in  new  bands.’  
‘All  right,  then,’  I  said.  ‘We  won ’t  combine  it.  We’ll  keep  the  two  companies  separate.  We  can  
arrange  the  financing  so  that  Virgin  Music  is  scarcely  at  risk.  I’ve  spoken  to  Boeing,  and  they  can  
offer  a  lease  whereby  they  take  the  plane  back  after  a  year  if  it  doesn’t  work.  The  most  Virgin  would 
lose  would  be  £2  million.’  
Simon and Ken remained resolutely opposed.  
‘Come  on,’  I  ploughed  on.  ‘Virgin  can  afford  to  make  this  step.  The  risk  is  less  than  a  third  of  
this  year’s  profits.  Money  from  Culture  Club  is  pouring  in.  And  it’ll  be  fun.’  
Simon  and  Ken  both  winced  when  I  said  ‘fun’,  which  is  a  particularly  loaded  word  for  me   – it’s  
one of my prime business criteria. Since I had made up my mind, I knew I had to convince them. I 
carried on arguing that we would only have one plane, that we could  just dip our toe into the water, 
and that if the water was too hot we could cut our losses. I explained that the beauty of starting up 
from  scratch  rather  than  buying  an  existing  airline  was  that  we  could  easily  retreat  if  it  didn’t  work.  In  
my mind it wa s that simple. Simon was most worried that I was risking the value of his shareholding 
in the Virgin Group, and I think Ken thought I had gone way over the top.  
In  the  same  way  that  the  argument  over  The  Human  League  had  been  a  turning  point  in  Simon’s  
and my relationship with Nik, the argument that lunchtime was a turning point in my relationship with 
Simon. Over the years I had unnerved him several times, but th is time he felt that I was prepared to bet 
the company and all our accumulated wealth on a scheme that he thought was totally harebrained. 
Simon’s  interest  and  love  for  life  comes  from  the  arts,  from  music,  books,  his  collection  of  paintings  
and beautiful cars. My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable, 
challenges and trying to rise above them. From a purely commercial perspective, Simon was 
absolutely right; but from the viewpoint of wanting to live life to the full, I fel t I had to attempt it. 
From that lunchtime onward a tension sprang up in our relationship which has never fully dissolved.  
Randolph was proposing to call the airline British Atlantic, but if I was going to be involved I 
wanted  to  bring  ‘Virgin’  into  the  ti tle. We agreed to differ on that until the airline was a little closer to 
reality.  There  was  a  lot  to  learn,  so  I  asked  Sir  Freddie  Laker,  a  man  I’ve  always  admired,  whether  he  
could help me. Sir Freddie came to have lunch on Duende  and explained the mecha nics of an airline. 
He quickly confirmed my suspicions about the limitations of starting an airline that was exclusively 
business class.  
‘And  you  don’t  want  to  be  all  no -frills  economy  service  either,’  he  pointed  out.  ‘That  was  my  
mistake.  You’ll  be  vulner able to the simple cost -cutting  attack  which  put  me  out  of  business.’  
We began a discussion on the philosophy of the business -class service at that lunch. We talked 
about offering a first -class service at business -class fares, and building in all kinds of extra services for 
the cost. Two of the best ideas that came out of our lunch were to offer a limousine pick -up as part of 
the service and offer a free economy ticket to anyone who flew business.  Freddie also warned me to expect some fierce competition fro m British Airways.  
‘Do  all  you  can  to  stop  BA,’  he  said.  ‘Complain  as  loudly  as  possible,  use  the  Civil  Aviation  
Authority  to  stop  them,  and  don’t  hesitate  to  take  them  to  court.  They’re  utterly  ruthless.  My  mistake  
was that I never complained loudly enoug h.  They  destroyed  my  financing  and  it’s  too  late  for  me  now.  
I sued them and won millions of dollars, but I lost my airline. If you ever get into trouble, sue them 
before  it’s  too  late.  Another  thing,  Richard,  is  the  stress.  I’m  not  kidding,  but  you  should  have regular 
medical  checkups.  It  is  very  stressful.’  
Freddie told me that he was just recovering from cancer of the pancreas.  
‘You  need  to  go  to  a  doctor  and  ask  him  to  stick  his  finger  up  your  bum.  He’ll  be  able  to  tell  you  
what’s  what,’  Freddie  said.  
I was inspired to see that, despite all his problems, Freddie was still so ebullient. He was 
unbowed by the experience, and he saw me as his successor, picking up the flag where he had left off. 
I asked Freddie whether he would object if I called Virgin Atl antic’s  first  aircraft   Spirit of Sir Freddie , 
but he laughed it off:  
‘Not  the  first  one,’  he  said.  ‘My  name’s  a  liability  now  and  you’d  send  out  the  wrong  signals.  But  
I’d  be  honoured  when  you’ve  got  a  larger  fleet.’  
As Freddie left Duende  he  turned  round  and  shouted  back  at  me,  ‘One  last  word  of  advice,  
Richard.  When  you’re  bent  over  and  the  doctor’s  got  his  finger  up  your  bum,  make  sure  that  he  hasn’t  
got  both  his  hands  on  your  shoulders!’  
Roaring with laughter, he made his way along the t owpath.  
The first arrangement I made with Randolph was that we would have an equal partnership. I would 
invest the funds; he would run the airline. Randolph had already recruited two key people from Laker 
Airways: Roy Gardner, who had run the engineering s ide of Laker, and David Tait, who had run the 
American side of the operation.  
‘What  do  you  think  of  the  name?’  I  asked  David  Tait.  
‘British  Atlantic?’  He  snorted.  ‘Just  what  the  world  needs:  another  BA!’  
Using  David’s  reaction,  I  managed  to  get  Randolph  to  agree to change the name to Virgin 
Atlantic Airways, and then we formed our joint partnership.  
‘What  do  you  think  of  the  new  name?’  I  asked  David  Tait.  
‘Virgin  Atlantic?’  He  snorted.  ‘Nobody  will  ever  set  foot  inside  a  plane  called  “Virgin”.  It’s  
ridiculo us.  Who’d  fly  an  airline  that’s  not  prepared  to  go  the  full  distance?’  
Within a couple of weeks it became clear that the arrangement between Randolph and me would 
not work. At our first meeting in front of the Civil Aviation Authority, who monitor the safe ty of 
airlines, Randolph went in to talk about his plans for the new airline. Colin Howes, my lawyer from Harbottle and Lewis, was there. After watching Randolph blustering for a few minutes, Colin slipped 
out of the hearing to call me and advise me to get  across to Kingsway in Holborn:  
‘It’s  not  going  very  well,’  Colin  said.  ‘I  think  that  Randolph  is  digging  a  hole  for  himself.’  
I came into the hearing and saw that Randolph was being fiercely cross -examined by British 
Caledonian, who were objecting to our licence application. Our airline was purely an idea, a paper 
airline, so it was easy for them to run rings round us, asking what we intended to do about safety 
drills,  how  we  were  going  to  maintain  our  plane,  how  we  could  guarantee  our  passengers’  safety.  
Randolph was an impatient man, and I could see that he was growing angry and confused in the face 
of  this  sustained  questioning.  Equally,  the  CAA  were  looking  rather  sceptical  about  Randolph’s  ability  
to get an airline off the ground. When the CAA came on to the question of finances, the British 
Caledonian lawyer looked across the room at me and said:  
‘You’ll  have  to  have  a  lot  of  hits  on   Top of the Pops  to  keep  the  airline  going.’  
‘Actually,’  I  pointed  out  tartly,  ‘Virgin  made  profits  of  £11  million  last  y ear – more than twice 
those  of  your  client,  British  Caledonian.’  I  decided  not  to  mention  that  we  were  having  to  pay  out  
large sums of money to continue making 1984 . 
The CAA specified that the new airline would have to have working capital of £3 million an d 
gave their permission for us to fly in theory. This was the official blessing. Of course, the CAA could 
withdraw their permission at any time if we failed to meet safety requirements. We would have to 
have another CAA test once we had leased the aircraft , but for now we had the go -ahead to establish 
the airline. We rented a warehouse near Gatwick Airport, where we based Roy Gardner and his 
engineering team, and started recruiting pilots and cabin staff. We rented office space in the Air 
Florida office on Woodstock Street, just off Oxford Street, where we piggybacked on their computer -
reservations system and created a dummy file for the Virgin Atlantic flights. David Tait moved his 
family up from Miami back to their home in Toronto and started living at Vir gin  Music’s  office  in  
New York. A team of lawyers representing Boeing came over to London to start negotiating over the 
lease of the aircraft, and soon they were spending most of their days with me on the upper deck of 
Duende , while Joan and Holly lived on  the lower floor.  
The houseboat was becoming increasingly crowded with the addition of Holly, and the comings -
and-goings to do with the airline. Joan and I decided to look for a home on land for the family, and 
settled on a large, comfortable house off Lad broke Grove.  
The first casualty of Virgin Atlantic Airways was my relationship with Randolph Fields. Two 
things became clear. The first was that, since Virgin Group was being asked to guarantee the entire 
finances of Virgin Atlantic, Coutts Bank would only  countenance extending credit to us if we had 
control of Virgin Atlantic. They would not lend us money if we controlled only half the new airline. 
Since Randolph was not putting up any money, he saw the sense of this and reluctantly agreed that 
Virgin shou ld have a controlling share of the airline.  
A far more difficult problem with Randolph came about in his relations with the new Virgin 
Atlantic staff. Perhaps if we had had a longer time than the four months we gave ourselves it would 
have been different. But we felt that, if we were to survive the first year, we had to launch in June in 
order to take advantage of the heavy summer traffic and build up reserves and cash flow to keep us going through the lean winter months. It was a virtually impossible timet able, and demanded that we 
work  flat  out.  One  moment  we  might  be  choosing  the  design  of  the  air  hostesses’  uniform  or  working  
out the menu; the next we were arguing over some legal clause in the 96 -page document about the 
lease of the aircraft we were nego tiating with Boeing.  
I first got wind of serious trouble from David Tait, whom Randolph had employed in America 
and who was going to be crucial to our chances of succeeding.  
‘I’ve  resigned,’  he  told  me.  ‘I’m  sorry,  but  Randolph  is  impossible  to  work  with.’  
‘What’s  the  matter?’  I  asked.  I  knew  that,  without  David  selling  tickets  in  America,  Virgin  
Atlantic would be stillborn.  
‘I  can’t  tell  you  everything,’  David  said.  ‘It’s  just  impossible.  I’m  sorry,  but  I  wish  you  all  the  
best  and  hope  that  it’s  a  great  su ccess.’ 
I could tell that David was about to ring off, so I begged him to come over to London to see me. 
He had no money to buy a ticket, so I sent him one and he came two days later. When he arrived at 
Duende  he found me holding Holly, who was feverish an d screaming. Joan had gone off to buy more 
Calpol. We smiled at each other above the noise as I cuddled Holly.  
‘You  may  think  that’s  loud,’  David  said.  ‘But  I  can  tell  you  that  Randolph  can  scream  louder.  I  
can’t  work  for  him.’  
David’s  experience  confirmed  the growing realisation that we had to move Randolph to one side 
if we were going to get the airline started. David had taken a great gamble in joining Virgin Atlantic. 
He had moved his young family away from Miami back to Toronto, and was living by himse lf on the 
top floor of the Greenwich Village house that Ken Berry had bought. All he had was a desk, a 
telephone and a tiny bedroom, and he had to try to sell tickets to Americans for a start -up airline. 
Since he was unable to advertise Virgin Atlantic wit hout an American licence (which was to come 
only the day before we took off), David had tried to alert New Yorkers by advertising in the sky above 
Manhattan. On a cloudless spring afternoon, a formation of five small planes had planned to squirt out 
white and red smoke printing WAIT FOR THE ENGLISH VIRGIN  across the sky. Unfortunately, just 
as they were finishing, a single cloud blew over and obliterated the final letter, so New Yorkers craned 
their necks and wondered what the cryptic message WAIT FOR THE E NGLISH VIRGI  meant.  
David’s  falling -out with Randolph had been over the ticketing system. Randolph wanted to avoid 
all travel agents, who charged 10 per cent of the fare for their services, and instead sell every ticket 
through a theatre booking agency cal led Ticketron. David had looked at Ticketron, who charged only 
$5 for issuing a ticket, but had refused to deal with them.  
The  staff  from  the  Woodstock  Street  ticketing  office  had  also  complained  about  Randolph’s  
behaviour. They told me that he kept bursti ng into the room and asking everyone to leave it so that he 
could make telephone calls in private. I realised that Randolph was not the right person to run the new 
airline. I promised David Tait that, if he stayed, he would soon have no more trouble from R andolph.  
‘He  won’t  be  here  much  longer,’  I  said.  ‘You  can  deal  with  me  directly.’  As we worked through April and May, more and more of the airline staff dealt with me directly. 
Randolph was cut out of the operation. He became increasingly difficult to cope  with. Eventually my 
lawyers advised me to change the locks on the ticketing office to keep him out. As the inaugural flight 
fixed for June drew nearer, Randolph and I were on a war footing.  
I still wonder how we packed everything into those last few days. The newly trained cabin crew 
came up to the Woodstock Street office to man the telephones, which were ringing off the hook. The 
lease with Boeing was finally wrapped up, including a complete  maze of legal conditions, but 
basically allowing us to return the aircraft to them after a year and be reimbursed for at least the 
original cost. If the aircraft had risen in value then we would receive the increased price. After two 
months of negotiation  I  think  Boeing  were  rather  surprised  at  our  tenacity:  ‘It’s  easier  to  sell  a  fleet  of  
jumbos  to  an  American  airline  than  just  one  to  Virgin,’  admitted  their  negotiator  after  we  had  finished.  
The continual negotiation of music recording contracts had stood  me in good stead. As a side 
agreement to the lease contract, we had a currency agreement to protect us if the pound fell in value 
against the dollar (our exposure was in dollars).  
At one point I took Boy George in to meet all the staff in the Woodstock Street office. He was 
dressed in his usual bizarre collection of robes, with his hair plaited and braided and tied with ribbons 
and his gloves festooned with huge diamond rings. For a  minute he stood watching the complete chaos 
as everyone answered the phones, made out tickets, told passengers about our timetable, invited 
celebrities and journalists for the inaugural flight, and worked on dummy copies of the in -flight 
magazine. Then he  said: 
‘I’m  pleased  that  I’ve  got  my  feet  squarely  on  the  ground.’

1984  
ON 19 JUNE 1984,  three days before we were due to launch, I went down to Gatwick for our final 
CAA approval, a test flight. Maiden Voyager  stood by a departure gate  and I marvelled again at her 
size. I also wondered at the size of the Virgin logo on her tail fin. It was huge – the largest version that 
I had seen. I remembered back to the early 1970s when Simon and I asked Trevor Key to come up 
with some ideas for a n ew logo. Having drawn a blank, Trevor briefed graphic designer Ray Kyte, of 
design consultants Kyte & Company, who created the concept and supplied the visual styling for a 
signature -style   logo   which   can   be   interpreted   as   my   personal   endorsement,   the   ‘V’   f orming an 
expressive tick. Some marketing experts once analysed the logo and wrote about the upbeat way it 
rises  from  left  to  right.  This,  of  course,  might  have  been  going  through  Ray’s  head  when  he  developed  
the original idea. Seeing it up on the tail fin  made me begin to realise what we had started. This thing 
was going to happen: we had a jumbo.  
The entire cabin crew came on board for the ride, as did over a hundred Virgin staff, and I sat at 
the back with the CAA official. The plane had arrived only the  previous day, flown over from Seattle, 
and until we had received our formal CAA licence to fly, the engines were uninsured. We took off and 
the crew all burst out clapping and cheering. I could hardly stop myself from shedding a tear: I felt so 
proud of e veryone.  
Then there was a loud bang from outside. The plane lurched to the left and a massive flash of 
flame then a long trail of black smoke poured out from one of the engines.  
In that horrible stunned silence, the CAA official put his arm round my should ers. 
‘Don’t  worry,  Richard,’  he  said.  ‘These  things  happen.’  
We had flown into a flock of birds, and one of the engines had sucked in some of them and 
exploded. We needed a new engine overnight in order to do the CAA test flight again. Our inaugural 
flight  to New York was due to take off the day after tomorrow with 250 journalists and cameramen on 
board.  
Roy Gardner was with me and he radioed through to the team at British Caledonian who carried 
out our maintenance. When Maiden Voyager  had arrived the previ ous day, Roy had rejected two of 
the engines on financial grounds and asked for two others to be fitted. Now he recalled one of the 
engines, which had been taken to Heathrow and was about to be flown back to Seattle.  
When we landed I was standing beside th e plane trying to think of how to overcome this 
problem, when a press photographer came up to me smiling broadly.  
‘I’m  sorry,’  I  apologised.  ‘I’m  not  up  to  it  now.’  
‘I’m  sorry  too,’  he  said.  ‘I  saw  the  flames  and  smoke  pouring  out  of  your  engine.  I  actuall y got a 
great  shot  of  it.’  He  looked  at  my  dumbstruck  face  and  then  said,  ‘Don’t  worry  though.  I’m  from  the   Financial 
Times ;;  we’re  not  that  kind  of  paper.’  He  opened  up  his  camera,  pulled  out  the  film  and  gave  it  to  me.  I  
couldn’t  find  words  to  thank  him.   If that photograph had appeared in the press, it would have been the 
end  of  Virgin  Atlantic  before  we’d  even  begun.  
Unfortunately, because Virgin Atlantic did not have a CAA licence, we were uninsured for the 
engine. We had to pay £600,000 for a new one. A fter several desperate calls, I realised that there was 
no alternative. With a sinking feeling, I called up Coutts to let them know that a payment of £600,000 
would have to go through.  
‘You’re  very  close  to  your  limit,’  Chris  Rashbrook,  the  manager  of  our   account, said.  
Our overdraft limit with Coutts for the entire Virgin Group was set at £3 million.  
‘It’s  a  terrible  freak  accident,’  I  said.  ‘One  of  the  engines  blew  up  and  we  can’t  get  our  insurance  
until  we  get  our  licence.  Without  a  new  engine,  we  won’t   be  able  to  get  our  licence.  It’s  a  catch -22 
situation.’ 
‘Well,  I’m  just  warning  you,’  Rashbrook  told  me.  ‘You  spent  a  fortune  on  filming   Electric 
Dreams  and  we’re  still  waiting  for  the  MGM  cheque.’  
The MGM cheque was the £6 million which MGM had agreed to pay for the American 
distribution rights to Electric Dreams . 
‘Please  can  you  wait  until  I  get  this  inaugural  flight  out  of  the  way?’  I  asked.  ‘Let’s  sort  it  out  
when  I  get  home.  I’m  back  on  Friday.  We’ll  only  be  £300,000  over  our  limit.  When  the  MGM  cheque  
comes  through  we’ll  have  no  overdraft  and  around  £3  million  on  deposit.’  
He  said  that  he’d  think  about  it.  
The day before the inaugural flight, Maiden Voyager  was fitted with another engine and ready to 
fly again. The CAA official came on board and we too k off. This time there was no explosion and we 
were given our licence. I dashed back up to London to sort out another Randolph Fields crisis. We had 
offered  Randolph  £1  million,  but  he  thought  that  wasn’t  enough.  He  had  gone  to  a  judge  in  America  
and appli ed for an injunction to stop Maiden Voyager  from taking off. All through the night we had a 
damage -limitation meeting with David Tait, Roy Gardner and my lawyers, to try to work out an 
arrangement whereby we could prevent Randolph from ruining the airline.  The judge eventually threw 
the request out, but not before we had battled all night to keep on top of what he was up to. By dawn 
we felt that we would win, and at 6a.m. I ran a bath and lay in it. I felt exhausted. I tried to wash my 
face, but my eyes fel t sore and itchy as if a blast of sand had blown into them. David Tait came in and 
sat on the lavatory and we ran through the final list of things we had to do. David then left to catch 
Concorde so that he would arrive in New York before us in order to org anise the welcoming reception 
for the flight.  
On board for the inaugural flight, I was surrounded by family and friends, the people who had 
been most important to me, and to Virgin, over the last ten years. I sat next to Joan, with Holly on her 
lap. Behind  us was pretty much everyone from the entire Virgin Group. The aircraft was full of 
journalists and photographers, along with a collection of conjurors, entertainers and Uri Geller. As Maiden Voyager  taxied down the runway, the screen at the front of the c abin flickered into life and 
showed the backs of the pilots and the flight engineer as they sat in the flight deck and manned the 
controls. Over their shoulders we could see the view through the windscreen. An announcement came 
over the loudspeakers:  
‘Since this is our first flight, we thought you might like to share our view from the flight deck, 
and  see  what  really  happens  when  we  take  off.’  
We could see the view of the runway stretching out in front. Then we started speeding along: the 
tarmac rushing ben eath the windscreen gathered pace until the white lines were just a blur. But the 
pilots seemed rather relaxed: rather than staring intently ahead and flying the plane, they started 
looking sideways at each other and smiling. One of them had very long hair  beneath his cap; the other 
was a West Indian. We were now hurtling down the runway, and these two pilots were doing nothing 
about it. They were simply paying no attention. Everyone watching the screen held their breath: this 
was all some mad suicide fligh t by that lunatic Branson. There was a deathly hush. Then, just as the 
plane’s  nose  rose  up  and  the  runway  began  to  disappear  from  view,  the  West  Indian  reached  behind  
his ear, pulled out a joint, and offered it to his copilot. Before anyone was entirely s ure that this was a 
joke, the plane took off and the two pilots took off their caps and turned round to face the camera: they 
were Ian Botham and Viv Richards. The bearded flight engineer was me. The whole plane rocked with 
laughter. We had filmed it the p revious day on a flight simulator.  
  
 
We had loaded seventy cases of champagne on board. This number proved to be just about right 
for what turned into an eight -hour party. P eople  danced  in  the  aisles  as  we  played  Madonna’s  new  hit  
‘Like  A  Virgin’  and  Culture  Club   and  Phil  Collins.   For  a  quiet  interval   we  showed  the  movie  
Airplane , and the cabin crew started a Virgin tradition by giving out choc ices in the middle of the 
film. 
At  New  York’s  Newark  Airport  I  realised  that,  in  the  excitement  of  going,  I  had  forgotten  my  
passport. I was almost refused entrance to the reception party in the terminal. By some mistake, the 
cabin crew had thrown away all the cutlery, so they had to sc rabble around up to their elbows in all the 
rubbish bins retrieving the cutlery to wash it up and then get it back on board the plane. I embarrassed 
everyone except the Mayor of Newark when I was talking to him as I thought, for some bizarre 
reason, that h e had organised the catering. I took the return flight back to Gatwick and fell into my 
first long sleep for many weeks. I dreamt about exploding engines, cabin crew offering meals on 
plates straight from the rubbish bins, and pilots smoking marijuana. Whe n I woke up, I felt sure that 
nothing else could go wrong. A bad mistake.  
A taxi carried me back to London. As we pulled up at my house I saw a rather uncomfortable -
looking man sitting on the steps. At first I thought he was a journalist, but then I realis ed that it was 
Christopher Rashbrook, my account manager at Coutts. I invited him in, and he sat down in the sitting 
room. I was exhausted and he was fidgety. I was rather slow to understand what he was saying. But 
then I suddenly heard him say that Coutts  were  unable  to  extend  Virgin’s  overdraft  as  requested  and  
would therefore regrettably bounce any cheques that took our overdraft over £3 million. I rarely lose 
my temper – in fact I can count the times I have lost my temper on the fingers of one hand – but as I 
looked across at this man in his blue pinstripe suit with his neat little black leather briefcase I felt my 
blood boil. He was standing there in his highly polished black Oxford brogues and calmly telling me 
that he was going to put the whole of Vir gin out of business. I thought of the numerous times since 
March when I and the Virgin Atlantic staff had worked through the night to solve a problem; I thought 
about how proud the new cabin crew were to be flying with a start -up airline; and I thought abo ut the 
protracted negotiation we had fought with Boeing. If this bank manager bounced our cheques, then 
Virgin would be out of business within days: nobody would supply an airline with anything such as 
fuel or food or maintenance if word went about that th e cheques were bouncing. And no passengers 
would fly with us.  
‘Excuse  me,’  I  said  as  he  was  still  making  excuses.  ‘You  are  not  welcome  in  my  house.  Please  
get  out.’  I  took  him  by  the  arm,  led  him  to  the  front  door  and  pushed  him  outside.  I  shut  the  door  in  his 
bewildered face, walked back into the sitting room and collapsed on a sofa in tears of exhaustion, 
frustration and worry. Then I had a shower upstairs and called Ken:  
‘We’ve  got  to  get  as  much  money  in  from  overseas  as  possible  today.  And  then  we’ve  g ot to find 
new  bankers.’  
Our overseas record subsidiaries saved us that week. We managed to pull in enough money on 
Friday to keep us just below the £3 million overdraft limit. We gave Coutts no reason to bounce our 
cheques, and so we stopped them from pus hing the various Virgin companies, together with the new 
airline, into instant insolvency. It was a surreal situation: Virgin Music was set to make £12 million 
profit that year, and was forecast to make £20 million the following one. We were already one of  
Britain’s  largest  private  companies,  but  Coutts  were  prepared  to  push  us  into  insolvency   – and make 
3,000 people lose their jobs – for the sake of going £300,000 over our limit, with a cheque for £6 
million due to arrive any day from the States.  
The Coutt s crisis made me realise that we needed a tough financier to replace Nik. We needed 
someone who could cope with the finances of both Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Music and act as a 
bridge between the two. By surviving on cash flow and debt, the entire Virgin  Group was living too dangerously. The mid -1980s were boom years in the City, and every company seemed able to sell its 
shares to the public and raise millions of pounds to invest. Perhaps, I began to think, that was the way 
forward for Virgin.  
Apart from the four main operations, Virgin Music, Virgin Records shops, Virgin Vision and the new 
airline, Virgin Atlantic, there were now a host of new little companies operating under the Virgin 
umbrella. There was Top Nosh food, which delivered food around indust rial estates; Virgin Rags, a 
line of clothes; Virgin Pubs and Vanson Property, a property -development company which looked 
after our growing collection of properties and as a sideline was making a lot of money by buying, 
developing and then selling propert y. This disparate selection of businesses needed someone to put 
them in order.  
Don Cruickshank was recommended to us by David Puttnam, the English film -maker. He was a 
chartered accountant who had worked at the management consultants McKinsey for five year s before 
moving to be general manager of the Sunday Times  and then on to Pearson, where he had been 
managing director of the Financial Times . Robert Devereux, who by now was married to my sister 
Vanessa, had come across him when dealing with Goldcrest Film s, part of Pearson, but Simon knew 
nothing about him. Don started work in the cramped offices at Ladbroke Grove and was the first 
person at Virgin who had ever worn a suit and tie. Everyone marvelled at him. With Don as managing 
director, Virgin began to b e organised into a company that could attract outside investors.  
Soon Don brought in Trevor Abbott as finance director. Trevor had been with MAM, 
Management Agency & Music, an entertainment company which had managed the careers of Tom 
Jones and Engelbert H umperdinck,  and  had  set  up  its  own  record  label  to  launch  Gilbert  O’Sullivan.  
MAM had then diversified into music publishing, had a chain of hotels, operated a fleet of corporate 
jets, had nightclubs, and leased out fruit machines and jukeboxes. MAM had a great deal in common 
with Virgin, but as Trevor left he was already working on the merger between MAM and Chrysalis.  
Don and Trevor were soon holding meetings with banks and rearranging both our finances and 
the internal structure of the Group. As a whole,  Virgin’s  turnover  in  1984  was  going  to  exceed  £100  
million, and each time Don and Trevor saw me they expressed amazement at how things were run. 
They were aghast at the lack of computers in the Group, the lack of stock control, and the apparently 
rather c asual way Simon, Ken, Robert and I decided on how to invest our money. They came to see us 
on Duende  and set out how they proposed to reorganise Virgin with a view to inviting in some outside 
investors.  
The first thing they did was sort out our overdraft f acilities. Coutts and their parent company, 
National Westminster Bank, had been willing to close us down for exceeding a £3 million overdraft. 
Taking the same balance sheet to a different consortium of banks, Don and Trevor arranged an 
overdraft facility o f £30 million. They then looked at the structure of the Virgin Group and decided to 
close down a number of our smaller companies, such as Top Nosh food and the pubs. They divided 
the Virgin Group into Music, Retail and Vision, and then hived off Virgin Atl antic, together with 
Virgin Holidays, Heaven, The Roof Garden and Necker Island, into a separate private company. 
Simon and I were both 33 years old, as were Trevor and Ken. Don was a little older; Robert a little 
younger. We felt that we could take on any body, and we now set our minds to take the Virgin Group 
public. We were going from the rock market to the stock market.  15 ‘It  was  like  being  strapped  to  the  blade  of  a  vast  Pneumatic  drill.’  
1984 –1986  
I AM OFTEN ASKED  why I go in for record -breaking chall enges with either powerboats or hot -air 
balloons. People point out that, with success, money, and a happy family, I should stop putting myself 
and them at risk and enjoy what I am so lucky to have. This is an obvious truth, and part of me 
wholeheartedly ag rees with it. I love life; I love my family; and I am horrified by the idea of being 
killed and leaving Joan without a husband, and Holly and Sam without a father. But another part of me 
is driven to try new adventures, and I still find that I want to push  myself to my limits.  
If I were to think about it more carefully, I would say that I love to experience as much as I can 
of life. The physical adventures I have been involved in have added a special dimension to my life that 
has reinforced the pleasure I t ake in my business. If I had refused to contemplate skydiving, hot -air 
ballooning or crossing the Atlantic in a boat, I think that my life would have been the duller for it. I 
never think that I am going to die by accident, but if I were to die then all I can say is that I was 
wrong, and the hardened realists who kept their feet on the ground were right. But at least I tried.  
Apart from the thrill of the actual event, I love the preparation for it. A tremendous sense of 
camaraderie builds up within the team when we are preparing for a challenge, and if we are going 
after a record there is not only the technological challenge bu t also a great feeling of patriotism as the 
public cheers us on. There used to be a great many British explorers, all in the best tradition of Scott of 
the Antarctic, and I feel proud to follow in their footsteps.  
The first challenge I was involved in was to try to recapture the Blue Riband for Britain. In the 
Victorian age of steamships, the Blue Riband was awarded to the fastest ship across the Atlantic. In 
1893 the Blue Riband was held by the British Cunard Line. Then it went to three German ships, befor e 
Cunard won it back again in 1906 with RMS Lusitania , later sunk in 1915 by a German U -boat. After 
the First World War the Germans won it back, and then the Italian ship Rex won it in 1933 with an 
average crossing speed of 29 knots. In order to celebrate this achievement, and to celebrate the whole 
Blue Riband competition, an English shipowner and member of parliament called Harold Hales 
commissioned a monumental trophy. From then on, the Hales Trophy was awarded along with the 
Blue Riband.  
In the small pr int of the conditions of the award, Hales offered it to the fastest boat that crossed 
the Atlantic, and he defined the Atlantic as the stretch of sea between Ambrose Lightship on the 
American coast and the Bishop Rock Lighthouse, off the Scilly Isles. Hale s made no mention of the 
size of boat as long as it carried passengers; indeed nobody in those days ever considered that a small 
boat would have any chance of competing safely with the big ships.  
The next ship to win the Hales Trophy was SS Normandie , a Fr ench liner which crossed the 
Atlantic on her maiden voyage at an average speed of 30 knots. In 1952, before the age of the big 
passenger ships came to an end, the SS United States  won the Hales Trophy with a crossing that took 
3 days, 10 hours and 40 minut es. The Hales Trophy was then put away in the American Merchant 
Marine Museum. Unfortunately, Harold Hales did not live to witness the SS United States : with 
horrible irony he had drowned in a boating accident on the River Thames. The glorious days of passenger liners faded as people began to use the new form of transport, aeroplanes, and everyone 
forgot about the Hales Trophy.  
In 1980 a powerboat builder called Ted Toleman decided to resurrect the Blue Riband 
competition and attempt to win the Hales Trophy  back for Britain. In order to do so, he would have to 
build a boat that could cross the Atlantic in less than 3 days, 10 hours and 40 minutes. The SS United 
States  was a truly impressive ship: she weighed 52,000 tons and needed 240,000 horsepower to shift  
her. The speed record she set was impressive: an average of 35.6 knots (equivalent to 40 miles an 
hour). In contrast to this huge 52,000 -ton liner with its swimming pool and grand piano, Ted planned a 
lightweight catamaran.  
Sailing a small, fast boat acro ss an ocean is extremely dangerous. For one, you are very 
vulnerable to waves. In this respect, a larger steamer finds heavy seas much easier: it just slices 
through  them.  The  passengers  may  use  the  excuse  of  a  slight  roll  to  lurch  into  one  another’s  arms   on 
the  dance  floor,  but  the  boat’s  speed  is  unimpaired.  With  a  small  boat,  an  ill -judged steering move at 
30 knots can plunge the prow into the side of the wave and cause the whole boat to go under or break 
apart. 
Ted Toleman designed a 65 -foot catamaran, and launched it in 1984. Rather than the SS United 
States ’  240,000 -horsepower engines, which were the size of small cathedrals, Ted used two 2,000 -
horsepower engines, which could propel his catamaran at almost 50 k nots on calm water. Of course, it 
is one thing to be able to race across a calm lake at 50 knots; quite another to reach those speeds on the 
choppy surface of the Atlantic Ocean, where the waves swell to 20 feet or higher. Ted knew that he 
would be lucky t o reach speeds of 35 knots. It would still be a three - to four -day crossing. The 
challenge was whether it would be three days and nine hours or three days and eleven hours.  
During  1984,  Ted’s  budget  for  the  boat  overran  and  he  approached  me  to  sponsor  the   cost of the 
trip, in return for my being able to name the boat and join him in the challenge. He had already asked 
Chay Blyth, the round -the-world yachtsman, to help him. Virgin Atlantic had just started flying, and 
although I was immediately attracted by the idea of winning a trophy back for Britain – Britain 
doesn’t  have  that  many  trophies   – I also relished the chance to promote our new airline. A successful 
Atlantic crossing would attract publicity in both New York and London, our sole destinations.  
‘How fit  are  you?’  Chay  asked  me.  
‘Not  bad,’  I  ventured.  
‘That’s  not  good  enough,’  Chay  said.  ‘There’s  no  room  for  passengers.  You  need  to  get  into  
shape.’ 
And so I started the most gruelling fitness programme of my life.  
‘You’re  going  to  be  pounded  for  three   solid  days,’  Ted  said  as  we  killed  ourselves  in  the  gym.  
‘You’ve  got  to  be  able  to  take  it.’  
We asked Esso to sponsor the trip by providing the fuel, and when they kindly agreed to do so we 
all went along to a celebratory lunch with their whole board of di rectors.  ‘I  want  to  thank  you  all  very  much,’  I  said  sincerely.  ‘It’s  going  to  be  a  great  trip,  and  we’re  
really  going  to  advertise  BP  as  much  as  we  can.’  I  thought  that  I  heard  a  collective  intake  of  breath,  
but  I  ploughed  on  regardless.  ‘We’re  going  to  p laster BP all over the refuelling ships, have your logo 
on  the  boat,  really  put  BP  on  the  map.  Nobody  will  ever  confuse  you  with  that  old  rival  of  yours  …’  
At this point I looked up at the wall opposite me and noticed the huge Esso logo. I realised my 
mistake. The Esso executives looked at me with horror, as if I were a ghost. I fell down on the floor 
and crawled under the table.  
‘I  am  sorry,’  I  said,  and  started  to  spit  and  polish  their  shoes.  
Remarkably, Esso were as good as their word and went ahead with  sponsoring the trip.  
The boat and the crew were put through their paces for two months until we were finally ready.  
Joan was nearly eight months pregnant with our second child, and I was desperately hoping to do 
the crossing in time to be back for the bir th. But we were stuck in New York for three weeks waiting 
for the stormy weather to clear. In those three weeks I kept flying back to London to be with Joan, and 
then flying back to New York when they told me we were about to set sail. By the time I had cr ossed 
the Atlantic eight times, I felt as though I knew it as well as I wanted to at 30,000 feet.  
The storms cleared and we got the green light. Joan told me that she was feeling fine and that I 
should go. She still had two weeks before the baby was due. W e roared out of Manhattan and headed 
north. 
The other crucial difference between Virgin Atlantic Challenger  and the great liners was comfort: 
while the passengers in the 1930s danced to jazz bands and played deck quoits, we were strapped in 
airline seats a nd pounded relentlessly up and down. With the deafening noise of the engines and the 
constant reverberation, it was like being strapped to the blade of a vast pneumatic drill. We could 
hardly talk, let alone move; we just had to stomach an unending sequenc e of banging, shaking and 
clattering.  
Towards the end of the first day I got a radio message.  
‘Richard.’  It  was  Penni,  who  was  at  the  control  centre.  ‘Joan’s  in  hospital  and  she’s  just  had  a  
baby  boy.  Rose  was  with  her  and  it  all  went  fine.’  
I’d  broken  my   pledge,  but  most  importantly  we’d  had  a  healthy  child.  We  all  whooped  with  joy  
and Steve Ridgway, another member of the crew, rustled up a bottle of champagne to toast Joan and 
my new son. Without any extra shaking from me, the bottle exploded and fizzed e verywhere. It was 
impossible to drink. The champagne foamed between our teeth and foamed up and down our throats. 
Holding on to a lifeline, I staggered to the side and threw the bottle overboard, where it bobbed in the 
wake. Now I had to power on to see Jo an, Holly and our baby boy.  
The crossing would have won the record comfortably. We endured three hellish days of mental 
pile-driving over 3,000 miles. We had three refuelling stops lined up at 800 -mile intervals. These fuel 
boats were enormous ships which loomed over us like skyscrapers. Even with a small swell, the 
approach to them was terrifying: we drew up about 30 yards away, and they fired a harpoon towards us with a buoy on the end of the line. We hauled this on board and then pulled out from the ship  the 
great hose with the fuel. When this was clamped on, we gave the go -ahead and the fuel was pumped 
on board. The smell of petrol and the rolling swell made us all sick. And as we staggered to the edge 
and retched we seemed in danger of smashing into the  vast black and rusted cliff face of the fuel 
boat’s  side. 
As we approached Ireland with only a few hundred miles to go, we hit a ferocious storm. We had 
been battered solidly for three days, but this was the worst yet. The boat smashed up and down. We 
held on to our seats and could see nothing. As we approached the Scilly Isles, with only 60 miles left 
and the Hales Trophy nearly in our hands, we hit a massive wave. A second later there was a shout 
from Pete Downie, our engineer.  
‘We’re  going  down.  The  hul l’s  split  right  open.  Get  out  fast.’  
‘Mayday!  Mayday!  Mayday!’  Chay  was  on  the  radio  in  a  flash.  ‘ Virgin Challenger  is sinking. 
We  are  abandoning  ship.  Repeat:  we  are  abandoning  ship.  Hey,  Ted!’  Chay  swung  round.  ‘You’re  the  
skipper:  you’re  meant  to  be  the  last  off!’ 
Within seconds the boat started to go down. The first life raft we inflated snagged on something 
and ripped open. We had a backup raft which we threw overboard and pulled the ripcord to inflate.  
‘Nobody  panic!’  Chay  shouted.  ‘There’s  no  hurry!   Everyone  take  their  time!’  
As  we  edged  along  the  rail  to  get  into  the  life  raft,  Chay  shouted  out,  ‘Panic!  Panic!  We’re  going  
down.  Move  it!’  
The life raft was like a tiny inflatable coracle with a hooded tent. We huddled together, rocking 
up and down in t he sea like we were on a crazy funfair ride. I was sitting next to the radio, and I 
picked up the mike. An RAF Nimrod picked up our Mayday. I gave the pilot our position, and he 
rapidly radioed any ships in the area.  
‘OK,  there  are  three  vessels  in  the  are a  that  are  heading  towards  you,’  the  pilot  came  back  to  me.  
‘In  no  particular  order,  there  is  the   QE2, which is heading for New York; an RAF helicopter from the 
Scilly Isles has been mobilised, and a Geest boat heading to Jamaica is also on its way. Please  take the 
first  one  that  arrives.’  
‘Tell  him  I’m  not  going  in  a  fucking  banana  boat  to  Jamaica,’  Chay  said.  ‘Neither  am  I  going  
back  to  New  York.  I  want  the  bloody  helicopter.’  
‘That’ll  be  fine,’  I  said  over  the  radio,  deciding  not  to  pass  on  Chay’s  comment,  since  for  once  I  
thought we were in no position to negotiate.  
Ted was gutted. He sat there in silence, his dream shattered.  
From the tiny hatch door we could see the stern of  Virgin Challenger  sticking out above the 
water.  The  rest  of  the  boat  was  underwater.  All  you  could  see  was  the  word  ‘Virgin’.  
‘Well,  Richard,’  Chay  said,  pointing  at  the  logo,  ‘as  usual  you  got  the  last  word  in.’  As  we  waited,  I  started  a  chorus  of  ‘We’re  all  going  on  a  summer  holiday  …’  Everyone  sang  
along, even Ted.  
Eventually we were picked up by the Geest banana boat on its way to the Caribbean. We were 
winched up in turn and left the life raft spinning by itself.  
‘Handy  in  case  anyone  else  capsizes,’   said Chay.  
It  was  dinnertime  and  the  guests  were  gathering  in  the  captain’s  quarters.  Rather  like  in  the  great  
days of ocean steamers, they were all wearing dinner jackets and evening gowns. We were a 
bedraggled lot in our damp nylon survival suits.  
‘My  poor  boy,’  one  elderly  lady  said  to  me.  ‘And  you  haven’t  even  seen  your  newborn  son  yet,  
have  you?’ 
‘No,’  I  said.  ‘I’m  afraid  we’re  heading  off  to  Jamaica  so  I  won’t  see  him  for  a  while.’  
‘Well,  I’ve  got  this  photograph  of  him  for  you.’  
To my astonishment, s he  pulled  out  that  day’s  edition  of  the  London   Evening Standard . And 
there on the front page was a picture of our tiny son wrapped up in a shawl. I have to admit to a tear in 
my eye as I looked at it.  
A salvage team radioed us to ask permission to salvage the boat.  
‘Of  course,’  I  said,  looking  out  of  the  porthole  to  where  we  could  still  see  the  stern  sticking  up  
like a tombstone.  
‘You  bloody  idiot!’  Chay  snapped  at  me.  ‘You  never  want  to  see  that  boat  again.  Just  a  lot  of  
waterlogged electronics which will never  work  again.  You’ll  never  get  a  penny  from  the  insurers.’  
‘On  second  thoughts,’  I  said,  ‘perhaps  I  can  call  you  back?’  
‘Right  you  are,’  they  said.  
I put down the phone and Chay and I looked across the sea at Virgin Challenger . As we did so, it 
silentl y plunged below the surface.  
It took a month for the ringing in my ears to stop. I was beginning to think I had permanent brain 
damage. However, winning the Blue Riband and the Hales Trophy became unfinished business. We 
were determined to succeed. Chay an d I felt that, after what had happened to Challenger , we should 
build a single -hulled boat rather than a catamaran, because it would be stronger. Since Ted Toleman 
specialised in catamarans, he refused to change the design and dropped out. We formed a new team 
with  three  key  members  of  Ted  Toleman’s  original  crew,  Chris  Witty,  Steve  Ridgway,  and  Chris  
Moss, who asked me whether they could come to work for Virgin. Chay Blyth stayed with the project 
as the presiding sailing expert, and together we designed a new boat.  On 15 May 1986, Virgin Atlantic Challenger II  was launched by Princess Michael of Kent. The 
boat was 75 -feet long, with a single hull. We were confident that she could cope with the heavy seas 
much better than her predecessor. But as we sailed he r around the south coast on her maiden voyage 
towards Salcombe, we cannoned off a vast wave which almost spun the boat over. Everyone was 
hurled across the deck and one of our crew, Pete Downie, broke his leg. The agony on his face was 
more to do with the realisation  that  he  wouldn’t  be  with  us  than  the  pain  from  his  leg.  Chay  fractured  a  
toe and Steve was almost swept overboard. We arrived at Salcombe like a hospital boat.  
We shipped the boat over to New York, and once again waited for good weather. When w e left 
New York Harbour on a bright June morning in 1986 and headed up towards Nova Scotia, we braced 
ourselves once more for the pounding. It was not as bad as the first time, and the trip up the east 
seaboard of America was much faster than we hoped. We sped along and after eighteen hours met the 
first refuelling ship off the coast of Newfoundland.  
We refuelled and headed off into the gathering darkness. The summer night was short, and we 
were travelling northeast, which made it shorter still, so we had j ust five hours of darkness to cope 
with. We relied on the radar and trying to squint ahead through the night -vision goggles, but still had 
no idea what was ahead. Motoring at that speed through the night was like driving blindfold, and we 
narrowly missed a  surfacing whale.  
By the second day the adrenaline rush which had kept us going had worn off. It was now just 
horrible, relentless banging. Each wave smashed us up and down, up and down, until we could no 
longer grin and bear it: we had to just clench our teeth and bear it.  
As we approached RV2, the refuelling boat, off the coast of Canada, we also had to keep an 
intense  lookout  for  icebergs.  Large  icebergs  show  up  on  the  radar  and  can  be  avoided;;  it  is  the  ‘small’  
ones, tiny blips above the surface which a ctually weigh 100 tons and could smash the hull, that are 
dangerous. Indeed, even an iceberg the size of a beanbag could seriously damage the hull. The 
difficulty was that, as hour after hour passed and we were deafened by the roar of the engines, it was 
impossible to keep our concentration going. We still had over 2,000 miles to travel. Each minute of 
every hour was a battering. This was where the strength of the team came through: we all rallied round 
to help each other get through it.  
As we waved goodbye  and revved up the engines to speed away from the second refuelling boat, 
our engines coughed, choked, and conked out. Eckie Rastig, our new engineer, went below decks to 
investigate. He came back up horrified: the fuel filters were full of water. This was  a disaster. He took 
a dipstick sample and reckoned that for every 12 tonnes of fuel taken on board we had also taken on 
about 4 tonnes of water. It was a complete mystery as to how the water had got in with the fuel, but we 
had no time to worry about that .  Maybe  it  was  the  Esso  directors’  revenge  for  my  blunder  over  BP!  
The diesel and the water had emulsified together, which meant it was impossible to split the water off 
from the diesel: we had to drain the entire four fuel tanks and start again. The Esso boat came back 
alongside and we filled up again, taking another precious three hours.  
We restarted the engines but they conked out again. It was now 11p.m. and we had spent seven 
hours bobbing up and down next to the refuelling boat in the middle of the fr eezing ocean. The race 
was slipping away. The swell grew progressively worse.  ‘The  storm’s  catching  up  with  us,’  Chay  said.  ‘This  isn’t  funny.’  
The storm, which was following the wonderful weather we had enjoyed on the first day, was not 
an abrupt, fierce storm, but just a big spell of filthy weather, our worst nightmare. Soon the boat was 
riding waves which had grown to 50 feet. We hardly dared stand on deck because one moment we 
were well beneath the vast Esso ship so that it looked as if it must topple o ver on top of us; the next 
moment  we  were  thrown  up  way  above  it  and  we  couldn’t  believe  that  we  wouldn’t  skate  down  the  
edge of the wave and crash into it. By now the suffocating petrol fumes made us all sick. Everyone 
was retching and puking and doubled up in pain. Our survival suits were soaked with seawater and 
flecked with vomit; our faces were white and green; our hair was frozen.  
‘It’s  not  worth  going  on,’  Chay  shouted  in  my  ear.  ‘We’ve  all  spoken  and  we’re  all  gutted.  It’s  
over.  I’m  sorry,  Richard.’  
I knew that if we failed on this attempt there would be no third time. We had to go for it. I had to 
persuade them.  
‘Let’s  just  try  to  get  the  engines  going  and  see  how  far  we  can  get,’  I  said.  ‘Come  on.  We’ve  got  
to  make  a  stab  at  this.’  
There was an engine specialist called Steve Lawes on board the Esso boat whom I knew. I asked 
him to come aboard and help us. They set up their winch and swung him out over the side. With the 
two boats swinging up and down on the giant waves, it was astoni shingly brave of him to try. With 
perfect timing they dropped him on our deck and he snapped off the belt before he could be swept 
back into the air as another wave drove us down and the Esso boat up. Steve went down to join Eckie 
in the engine room. There  was a tiny space beside the engines, and together they drained the fuel tanks 
and took on more fuel. I went down to see them, but there was no room for anyone else.  
I  didn’t  have  to  beg  Steve  to  stay  with  us.  
‘I’ll  stay  just  for  the  pleasure  of  the  ride,’  he said, oil stains already covering his face.  
I suddenly felt that we had a chance.  
‘There’s  still  water  in  the  fuel,’  Eckie  said.  ‘But  we  can  filter  it  out  as  we  go.  We’re  going  to  
have  to  do  it  every  few  hours.’  
I hauled myself back upstairs and found Chay of all people throwing up over the side. I pulled 
him by the shoulder.  
‘Steve’s  going  to  stay,’  I  shouted  in  his  ear.  ‘We  can  go  on.’  
‘It’s  over,  Richard,’  Chay  shouted  at  me.  ‘It’s  fucking  well  over.  This  boat’s  knackered.’  
‘We’ve  got  to  go  on,’  I  ye lled. 
For a moment we stood there, eyeball to eyeball, clutching on to each other like two old drunks. 
We had flecks of vomit in our beards; our eyes were red and bloodshot from the salt and the fumes; our faces were drained of colour; and our hands were r aw and bleeding. With another lurch of the sea, 
we staggered against each other, utterly exhausted. We hated this boat; we hated this trip; we hated the 
sea; we hated the weather; and – right now – we certainly hated each other.  
‘We’ve  got  to  go  on  and  do   it,’  I  repeated  like  a  madman.  ‘We’ve  just  got  to  do  it.  It’s  the  only  
way.  What  are  you  suggesting?  That  we  get  towed  home?’  
‘God,  you’re  worse  than  me,’  Chay  said.  ‘All  right.  We’ll  give  it  one  last  shot.’  
I hugged him and we both fell against the railin gs. 
‘Right!’  Chay  yelled  to  the  crew.  ‘We’re  casting  off.’  
We all summoned up our strength again and went into action. We cast off from the refuelling 
boat and, with fine -tuning from Eckie and Steve, the engines roared back into life. They were 
coughing and spluttering and liable to cut out, but at least they work ed  and  we  didn’t  have  to  get  out  
the oars. We waved up at the Esso boat, and headed off into a grey light. We felt better now that we 
were away from the oil fumes, but we were all exhausted. I felt as if my stomach had been punched 
over and over again by a  prize fighter. Everyone was now in his own world, fighting to get through 
each hour. I just kept repeating to myself that we had to get on. As well as fighting the weather and the 
fuel, we were all immersed in fighting our own will not to collapse.  
Every four hours the fuel filters were so clogged up that they needed replacing. We stopped the 
engines; Steve and Eckie replaced the filters, and on we went. As hour by hour passed, it became clear 
that we were not going to have enough filters to make the last refuelling stop. The filters would run 
out and the engines would break down. We would be marooned at sea. I was in touch with a passing 
Nimrod (as one is!) who had taken us under its wing. These planes spend hour after hour flying over 
the Atlantic searchi ng for submarines, and we were a welcome diversion. The pilot suggested that 
another Nimrod could come out and drop a load of filters, but they would need to get clearance from 
the top. I radioed Tim Powell, who was running the control centre from the Oxfo rd Street Megastore.  
‘Tim,  we  need  help.  We  need  some  fuel  filters  dropped.  The  Nimrod  has  offered  to  do  it,  but  they  
need to get clearance – right  from  the  top.’  
Within an hour, Tim had spoken to the right people at Downing Street, and an RAF Nimrod had 
picked up the filters from Southampton and was flying to meet us.  
We  didn’t  hear  the  plane  coming.  It  just  swooped  low  overhead,  coming  straight  out  of  the  grey  
cloud behind us. It was huge, and although there was no sun the plane seemed to drain all the li ght and 
cast us in shadow. The Nimrod roared over us, with a rumble which shook the boat, and dropped a 
small drum attached to a buoy in our path. We all danced and whooped with joy. Chay cut back the 
engines and aimed for the little red marker. Steve pick ed it up with a long hook, and we hauled it on 
board: it was a steel drum packed with filters. On top of the filters were some chocolate bars and a 
little  handwritten  note  which  said:  ‘Good  luck!’  
We radioed up to the pilot and thanked him.  ‘I’ve  got  a  TV   crew  on  board,’  he  said.  ‘The  whole  country’s  on  the  edge  of  their  seat.  God  
speed.’ 
We reached the third Esso ship and, with another set of full tanks and some Irish stew for us, our 
first hot meal in two days, we approached the last leg of the crossing w ith rising determination. We 
calculated that we had to travel at an average speed of 39 or 40 knots for the final twelve hours if we 
were to break the record. With our engines in the state they were, it was going to be extremely close. 
We battled through m ore heavy weather, unable to go faster than 30 knots for three hours, then the sun 
came out and the sea calmed. Steve and Eckie replaced the filters for the last time, and we opened the 
throttles and went flat out across the sea, hurtling over the waves to wards the Scilly Isles.  
When we passed the point where we had sunk on the previous attempt we all cheered and 
suddenly knew that we could do it. Five miles out from the Scillies, we were met by a posse of 
helicopters and then hundreds of boats of all kinds  who welcomed us home. We zoomed past Bishop 
Rock Lighthouse at 7.30p.m. Eckie and Steve staggered up from the engine room. They were the 
heroes who had endured three days of pounding in a hot cramped engine room, standing ankle deep in 
oil while they foug ht to keep the engines going. Dag Pike switched off his navigational system and we 
all threw our arms round each other. We had done it. Our total journey had lasted 3 days, 8 hours and 
31 minutes: in a voyage of over 3,000 miles, we had beaten the Blue Rib and record by a mere 2 hours 
and 9 minutes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16 The  world’s  biggest  balloon  
1986 –1987  
‘AFTER THE BIG BANG ,  how  about  a  little  pop?’  
By 1986 everyone was heading for the City. Everyone who had bought shares in British Telecom 
had doubled their money.  
I will never forget going into the City to see the lines of people queuing up to buy Virgin shares. 
We had already had over 70,000 postal applicants to buy Virgin shares, but these people had left it 
until the last day, 13 November 1986. I walked up and do wn the queue thanking people for their 
confidence, and a number of their replies stuck in my mind:  
‘We’re  not  going  on  holiday  this  year;;  we’re  putting  our  savings  into  Virgin.’  
‘Go  on,  Richard,  prove  us  right.’  
‘We’re  banking  on  you,  Richard.’  
At one poin t  I  noticed  that  the  press  photographers  were  taking  pictures  of  my  feet.  I  couldn’t  
understand it. Then I looked down and noticed with a shock that, in the rush to get dressed, I had put 
on  shoes  that  didn’t  match.  
The flotation of Virgin attracted more a pplications from the public than any other stock -market 
debut issue, apart from the massive government privatisations. Over 100,000 private individuals 
applied for our shares, and the Post Office drafted in twenty extra staff to cope with the mail sacks. 
That day we heard that The Human League had gone to number one in America. Beneath our 
euphoria, we were worried to hear that only a small number of City institutions had applied for shares. 
It was the first sign of the difficulty we were going to have in o ur dealings with the City.  
By   1986   Virgin   had   become   one   of   Britain’s   largest   private   companies,   with   some   4,000  
employees. For the year ended July 1986, Virgin had sales of £189 million, compared with £119 
million for the previous year, an increase of aro und 60 per cent. Our pre -tax profits were £19 million, 
up from £15 million. Although we were a large company, we had very little flexibility to expand: all 
we could do was either use up the cash we had earned, or ask our bankers for a bigger overdraft. I 
watched a number of other private companies sell their shares on the stock market: Body Shop, TSB, 
Sock  Shop,  Our  Price,  Reuters,  Atlantic  Computers  …  There  was  practically  a  new  company  every  
week, and the stock exchange had to set up a queuing system so t hat, in between the massive 
privatisations of British Telecom, British Airways and BP, there was an orderly procession.  
When we arrived back from the Atlantic crossing, the entire country seemed to have enjoyed the 
challenge. Mrs Thatcher expressed an inte rest in seeing the boat, and I offered her a ride up the River 
Thames. We managed to win approval to break the five -mile-an-hour speed limit on the Thames, and 
Tower Bridge opened her gates as Atlantic Challenger  came whizzing through. We picked up Mrs 
Thatcher and, together with Bob Geldof and Sting, we did a lap of honour up to the Houses of 
Parliament and back, as other boats on the river blared their horns and the fire brigade pumped great plumes  of  water  into  the  air  in  salute.  Mrs  Thatcher,  the  ‘Iron   Lady’,  stood  on  the  deck  beside  me  and  
faced into the keen wind.  
‘I  must  admit,’  she  said,  as  we  accelerated  up  the  river,  ‘I  do  enjoy  going  fast.  I  love  powerful  
boats.’ 
I looked across at her. She was indeed enjoying herself. Her profile cut through the wind like a 
bowsprit, and not a single strand of hair had blown out of place.  
Although we had raised £30 million from the stock -market flotation, I soon began to feel that we had 
made the wrong decision. A few weeks after our flotation in November, our inv estment banker at 
Morgan Grenfell, Roger Seelig, was investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry over his 
role  in  Guinness’s  takeover  of  Distillers,  which  he  had  orchestrated  in  January.  Roger  resigned  from  
Morgan Grenfell and, although the case a gainst him was eventually abandoned, his career was ruined. 
Without being able to use Roger as a touchstone, I began to lose faith in the City and the onerous 
demands they made of us.  
Firstly, the City had insisted that Virgin appoint some nonexecutive dir ectors. Sir Phil Harris was 
recommended. He was a self -made man who had made a fortune from selling carpets. We also 
appointed Cob Stenham, who had been finance director of Unilever and was a well -respected banker. I 
found it difficult to comply with all t he formality the City insisted we adopt. I was used to chatting 
with Simon and Ken about which bands to sign, and then letting them get on with it. Virgin board 
meetings had always been highly informal affairs. We met on Duende , or at my house in Oxford 
Gardens, or while we were on a weekend together. I found our business was not one that could be 
boxed into a rigid timetable of meetings. We had to make decisions quickly, off the cuff: if we had to 
wait four weeks for the next board meeting before authorisi ng Simon to sign UB40, then we would 
probably lose them altogether.  
I also had a number of disagreements with Don, notably about dividends. I was extremely 
reluctant to follow British tradition and pay out a large dividend. I preferred the American or Japa nese 
tradition whereby a company concentrates on reinvesting its profits to build itself and increase share 
value. To me, a large dividend meant a loss of cash which would be better employed within Virgin 
than by paying it away. It seemed to me that our ou tside shareholders had entrusted their money to 
Virgin in order for us to make it grow, not for us to hand 5 per cent of it back on a plate – which 
would be taxed as income and so immediately lose 40 per cent of its value.  
This may sound like a petty argum ent, but it illustrates the general loss of control I experienced. 
Most people think that 50 per cent of a public company is the key to controlling it. While this is true in 
theory, to a large extent you lose control just by having to appoint nonexecutive directors and 
generally giving up your time to satisfy the City. Previously, I had always felt confident about any 
decision we made, but now Virgin was a publicly quoted company, I began to lose faith in myself. I 
felt uneasy about making the rapid decisio ns I have always made, and wondered whether every 
decision should be formally ratified and minuted at a board meeting. In many ways 1987, our year of 
being  a  public  company,  was  Virgin’s  least  creative.  We  spent  at  least  50  per  cent  of  our  time  heading  
off to the City to explain what we were doing to fund managers, financial advisers and City PR firms, 
rather than just getting on and doing it.  I also felt very responsible to the people who had invested in Virgin shares. Phil Collins, Mike 
Oldfield and Bryan  Ferry had bought shares; Peter and Ceris, my neighbours and close friends at Mill 
End, had invested some of their life -savings in Virgin; and my family, my cousins, and many people 
who had come across me in various walks of life, had all bought shares. Tr evor Abbott had borrowed 
£250,000 from me to buy Virgin shares, and, although he knew the figures even better than I, I still 
felt responsible in case the shares fell in value.  
I would not have minded if the City analysts had been correct in their assessme nt that Virgin was 
doing badly, or that the management was incompetent. What began to infuriate me was that – no 
matter how often Simon, Ken or I tried to explain that over 30 per cent of our income came from 
royalties from the back catalogue, and even if we failed to release another record we would still enjoy 
a stream of earnings; or that 40 per cent of our earnings in France came from French singers rather 
than Boy George or Phil Collins, giving us a steady local income – the City continually oversimplif ied 
how Virgin worked. The analysts still assumed that Virgin was wholly dependent upon me and Boy 
George.  Simon  and  Ken  started  taking  recordings  to  the  City  analysts’  meetings  and  playing  them  
UB40, The Human League and Simple Minds, but they remained un impressed. Virgin shares, which 
had started trading at 140 pence, soon slipped down to 120 pence. The faith which the people in the 
queue had placed in me, and the faith which the Virgin artists and staff placed in me by spending their 
own money on buying Virgin shares, began to overwhelm me.  
As 1987 progressed, the Virgin share price recovered to around 140 pence but never took off. We 
began to use the money we had raised from the flotation to make two investments: the first was to 
establish a proper Virgi n subsidiary in America; the second was to start stalking Thorn EMI with a 
view to launching a takeover bid for the company. Virgin Records America Inc. was not a cheap 
investment. We had learnt the hard way before and this time we invested heavily. During  1987 we 
managed to release four top -twenty singles and one gold album in America. Although Virgin America 
lost us money in 1987, it was a long -term investment and we felt sure that eventually we would make 
far more money from having our own record company  there than from licensing our best artists to 
American companies.  
The second challenge, stalking Thorn EMI, had to be done with care. We felt that the EMI record 
label was managed in a rather sleepy way and that their incredible back catalogue, which incl uded The 
Beatles, could be run far more profitably. The Thorn EMI Group as a whole was valued at around 
£750 million, three times the size of Virgin. Eventually I thought that the best thing to do was go 
round and have a chat with Sir Colin Southgate, the managing director of Thorn EMI, and ask him in a 
friendly way whether he would like to sell us EMI Music.  
‘Shall  we  come  along?’  Simon  and  Ken  asked.  
‘It  might  be  a  bit  overbearing,’  I  said.  ‘I’ll  slip  in  and  see  him  face  to  face,  and  then  if  he’s  keen  
we can  all  meet  him.’  
I called Sir Colin and arranged a meeting at his office in Manchester Square. I was shown up to 
the top floor of the office building, and ushered into a room. It fell silent. I was confronted by at least 
twenty unsmiling faces. They line d one side of the table, their pinstriped suits shoulder to shoulder, 
forming an unbreachable wall. Sir Colin shook my hand and peered over my shoulder to see whether 
there was anyone else.  ‘It’s  just  me,’  I  said.  ‘Where  shall  I  sit?’  
One side of the long,  gleaming mahogany table was empty. There were ten or fifteen memo pads 
and sharpened pencils laid out on it. I sat down and looked across at the sea of faces.  
‘Well,  let  me  introduce  you,’  Sir  Colin  began.  He  rattled  off  the  names  of  bankers,  lawyers,  
accountants and management consultants.  
‘I’m  Richard  Branson,’  I  introduced  myself  with  a  nervous  laugh.  ‘And  the  reason  I’m  here  is  
that  I  just  wondered  whether  you  would  like  to  …  might  like  to  …’  I  paused.  The  necks  opposite  all  
craned  towards  me.  ‘Might  like  to  sell  your  EMI  subsidiary,’  I  s aid.  ‘It  seems  to  me  that  Thorn  EMI  is  
such a big group and that EMI Music might not be your top priority. You have so much else going on. 
That’s  all.’ 
There was a hushed silence.  
‘We’re  quite  happy  with  EMI,’  Sir  Colin  said.  ‘We  are  taking  all  steps  to  ru n it as a leading 
member  of  the  Thorn  EMI  Group.’  
‘Oh  well,’  I  said.  ‘I  thought  it  was  worth  a  try.’  
And with that I stood up and left the room.  
I went straight round to see Simon and Ken at Vernon Yard.  
‘They’re  serious,’  I  said.  ‘They’re  on  an  emergency  footing.  They  thought  I  was  going  to  bid  for  
them.  They  practically  had  their  bayonets  fixed.  If  Sir  Colin’s  so  worried  that  he  brought  all  his  
heavies along, then they clearly are vulnerable and I think we  should  have  a  crack  at  them.’  
Simon and Ken agreed with me. Trevor arranged for us to go and see Samuel Montagu, another 
investment bank. Samuel Montagu introduced us to Mountleigh, a property group, and suggested that 
we could make a joint bid. Since S ir Colin would not sell EMI separately to us, we could bid for the 
whole Group with Mountleigh and then split it up: in a nutshell, Mountleigh would take the national 
chain of television -rental shops and we would take EMI Music.  
We knew that our first year ’s  profits  as  a  public  company  were  on  course  to  more  than  double,  at  
over £30 million (despite the cost of setting up in the States), and so we planned to release these 
results in October at the same time as announcing our bid for Thorn EMI.  
During the co urse of the summer, Trevor arranged a £100 million loan with the Bank of Nova 
Scotia and we slowly began buying shares in Thorn EMI, paying about £7 a share as we built up a 
stake which we could use as a launch pad for the bid. As the stock market soared h igher through the 
summer months and some rumours began to circulate that Thorn EMI was vulnerable to a bid, I began 
to worry that if we left it until October we might be too late. There was not much I could do about it, 
because I was determined to set off on a challenge which many people thought would be the end of 
me. A challenge as daunting and as daring as anything in the world of business. Per Lindstrand and I 
were planning to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in a hot -air balloon. Until I returned safe and  sound, 
nobody was going to take the idea of Virgin bidding for Thorn EMI too seriously.  It all dated from a telephone call I had received on my first day back at the office after the Atlantic 
Challenger  crossing.  
‘It’s  someone  called  Per  Lindstrand,’  Penn i  said.  ‘He  says  that  he’s  got  an  incredible  proposal.’  
I picked up the phone.  
‘If  you  thought  that  crossing  the  Atlantic  by  boat  was  impressive,’  said  a  stilted,  Swedish  voice,  
‘think  again.  I  am  planning  to  build  the  world’s  largest  hot -air balloon, and I’m  planning  to  fly  it  in  the  
jet  stream  at  30,000  feet.  I  believe  that  it  can  cross  the  Atlantic.’  
I had vaguely heard of Per Lindstrand. I knew that he was a world expert at ballooning and held 
several records, including one for reaching the highest alti tude. Per explained to me that nobody had 
flown a hot -air balloon further than 600 miles, and nobody had been able to keep a hot -air balloon up 
in the air for longer than 27 hours. In order to cross the Atlantic, a balloon would have to fly more 
than 3,000  miles, five times further than anyone had ever managed before, and spend three times 
longer up in the air.  
A balloon filled with helium, like the old zeppelins, can stay in the air for several days. A hot -air 
balloon relies on the hot air within the envel ope rising above the surrounding cold air and taking the 
balloon  with  it.  But  the  loss  of  heat  through  the  balloon’s  envelope  is  rapid,  and,  in  order  to  heat  the  
air,  balloonists  burn  propane.  Until  Per’s  proposed  flight,  hot -air balloons had been hampered  by the 
impossible weight of fuel needed to keep them afloat.  
Per thought that we could break the flight record by putting three theories into practice. The first 
one was to take the balloon up to an altitude of around 30,000 feet and fly along in the fast  winds, the 
jet streams, which move along at speeds of up to 200 miles an hour. This had previously been 
considered impossible as their power and turbulence could shred any balloon. The second was to use 
solar  power  to  heat  the  balloon’s  air  during  the  day  and thus save fuel. This had never been attempted. 
The third was that, since the balloon would be flying at 30,000 feet, the pilots would be in a 
pressurised capsule rather than the traditional wicker basket.  
As  I  studied  Per’s  proposal,  I  realised  with  a mazement that this vast balloon, a huge ungainly 
thing which could swallow the Royal Albert Hall without showing a bulge, was actually intended to 
cross the Atlantic Ocean in far less time than our Atlantic Challenger  boat with its 4,000 -horsepower 
engine.  Per reckoned on a flying time of under two days, with an average speed of 90 knots compared 
with  the  boat’s  speed  of  just  under  40  knots.  It  would  be  rather  like  driving  along  in  the  fast  lane  of  the  
motorway only to be overtaken by the Royal Albert Hall travelling twice as fast.  
After wrestling with some of the science and the academic calculations about inertia and wind 
speeds, I asked Per to come and see me. When we met, I put my hand on the pile of theoretical 
calculations.  
‘I’ll  never  understand  all  t he  science  and  theory,’  I  said,  ‘but  I’ll  come  with  you  if  you  answer  me  
this  one  question.’  
‘Of  course,’  Per  said,  stiffening  his  back  in  readiness  for  some  incredibly  challenging  question.  ‘Do  you  have  any  children?’  
‘Yes,  I’ve  got  two.’  
‘Right,  then.’  I  stood  up  and  shook  his  hand.  ‘I’ll  come.  But  I’d  better  learn  how  to  fly  one  of  
these  things  first.’  
It was only later that I learnt that seven people had already tried to be the first to cross the 
Atlantic and that five of them had perished.  
Per took me for  a  week’s  crash  course  on  ballooning  in  Spain.  I  discovered  that  ballooning  is  one  
of the most exhilarating things I had ever done. The combination of soaring up over the world, the 
silence when the burners are off, the sensation of floating, and the br eathtaking panoramic views all 
immediately seduced me. After a week of being shouted at by Robin Batchelor, my instructor, who 
looked like my double, I had my balloon licence. I was ready.  
As the prevailing jet stream flows from west to east, we found a la unch site in Maine, close to 
Boston, about a hundred miles inland to avoid the effect of sea breezes. Per reckoned that by the time 
we crossed the coast we should be up in the jet stream and above the local weather. Our two key 
mentors were Tom Barrow, who  headed the engineering team, and Bob Rice, an expert meteorologist. 
Both men were clearly such authorities that I unreservedly put my trust in them. The jet stream parts 
over the Atlantic, with one branch heading up to the Arctic and another branch swervi ng down to the 
Azores and back out to the middle of the ocean. Bob Rice told us that getting our route right was like 
‘rolling  a  ball  bearing  between  two  magnets’.  In  the  event  of  running  out  of  fuel  or  icing  up,  we  would  
have to ditch the balloon at sea.  
‘There  are  flotation  collars  round  the  capsule  which  will  keep  it  buoyant,’  Tom  Barrow  said.  
‘What  if  they  don’t  work?’  I  asked.  
‘You’ll  get  your  money  back,’  he  said.  ‘Or  rather,  we’ll  get  the  money  back  on  your  behalf.’  
At our final briefing with Tom at Sugarloaf Mountain, Maine, the day before the balloon went 
up,  he  went  through  the  last  emergency  drills:  ‘Landing  this  thing  is  going  to  be  like  freewheeling  a  
Sherman  tank  without  any  brakes.  It’s  going  to  be  a  crash.’  
His last warning was the most telli ng:  ‘Now,  even  though  we’re  here,  I  can  still  abort  this  project  
if  I  think  it’s  too  dangerous  or  if  you  develop  health  problems.’  
‘Does  that  include  mental -health  problems?’  I  joked.  
‘No,’  Tom  said.  ‘That’s  a  prerequisite  for  doing  this  flight.  If  you’re  not  completely  nuts  and  
scared  to  death,  then  you  shouldn’t  be  on  board  in  the  first  place.’  
I was certainly scared to death.  
 17 ‘I  was  almost  certainly  going  to  die.’  
1987 –1988  
PER AN D I TOOK  sleeping pills the evening before the launch. When we were woken up at 2a.m. it 
was pitch -dark, but as we were driven to the launch site we saw the vast balloon lit up by floodlights 
and towering over the trees. It looked astonishing: the sides we re silver and the dome was black. It 
was monumental. The balloon was fully inflated and straining at the anchors. We were worried that a 
wind might strike up and tip it over, so we climbed into the capsule and the ground crew set about the 
final checks.  
Inside the capsule, we were unaware of the accident which actually catapulted us upward. A 
cable became caught round two of the propane tanks and as the balloon strained up and down it pulled 
them off. Without their weight, the balloon shot up, still trailin g a couple of cables carrying sandbags. 
As we gained height and headed over the Maine forest towards the sea, Per climbed out of the capsule 
and cut the last two cables. We made rapid progress towards the glowing dawn, soaring along in the 
jet stream at 85  knots – just under 100 miles an hour. After ten hours we had flown over 900 miles and 
had easily broken the long -distance record for a hot -air balloon. Over the radio Bob Rice told us to 
keep at 27,000 feet whatever happened, since that was where the fast  winds were.  
That first night we hit a storm and came down to calmer weather, but it was snowing and we 
immediately lost the speed of the jet stream.  
‘We  need  to  get  back  up  there,’  Per  said.  He  fired  the  burners  and  we  rose  again  to  meet  the  bad  
weather. The balloon was buffeted hard by the storm and the capsule was tossed to and fro, but just 
when we wondered whether we should head back down we shot o ut into clear weather and reached a 
speed of 140 knots – over 160 miles an hour. The next morning the Virgin 747, Maiden Voyager , 
arrived  and  flew  in  a  figure  of  eight  round  us.  My  mother’s  voice  came  crackling  over  the  radio:  
‘Faster,  Richard,  faster!  We’ ll  race  you.’ 
‘I’m  doing  my  best,  Mum.  Please  thank  the  crew  and  passengers  for  going  out  of  their  way  to  
greet  us,’  I  said.  
In fact, we sped along and crossed the coast of Ireland at 2.30 that afternoon, Friday 3 July. It 
was a dream crossing compared wit h the boat. We had been in the air for just 29 hours.  
The incredible speed of our flight gave us an unexpected problem: we still had three full tanks of 
fuel attached to the capsule, and they could well explode on landing. We decided to swoop down very 
low and drop off the fuel tanks in an empty field, and then come down a second time for a controlled 
landing. Per stopped burning propane and brought the balloon down low so that we could see where 
we could safely jettison the extra fuel tanks. As we came dow n, the wind suddenly swirled around us, 
much harder than we expected. The ground rushed up to meet us. Travelling at a speed of almost 30 
knots, 35 miles an hour, our groundspeed was not so much the problem as our sudden plunge 
downward. We hit the ground and bounced along a field. All our fuel tanks were torn off by the 
impact,  along  with  our  radio  aerials.  Without  the  weight  of  the  tanks,  we  hurtled  back  upward.  I  didn’t  see it, but we narrowly missed a house and an electricity pylon. We had hit the groun d in Limavady, a 
tiny Irish village.  
With no fuel tanks we were utterly out of control. Unless we could heat the air, once this rise 
topped out we would fall rapidly, gathering speed like someone in an unopened parachute. We had 
one small reserve fuel tank  inside the capsule with us, and Per quickly connected it to the burners.  
‘It’s  tangled,’  Per  said.  ‘The  cables  are  tangled.’  
The balloon was rising like a rocket. The top of the dome was forced down by the pressure, and 
the cable that hung down the middle  of the balloon snagged on something and started spinning us 
round in a knot. The whole balloon was twisting itself into a corkscrew, closing the mouth so that 
there was no chance of heating the hot air inside. As we began to drift downward, I opened the c apsule 
hatch and climbed out on top. I took my knife and hacked away at the twisted cable.  
‘Quick!’  Per  shouted  up  at  me.  ‘We’re  falling  fast.’  
I finally managed to cut the cable, and the balloon whipped round. The dome straightened out, 
and the hole in th e bottom of the envelope was open.  
‘Get  in!’  Per  yelled.  
As I dropped down through the hatch, he fired the burners full blast. We were within 300 feet of 
the ground, but the burst of heat steadied our descent and we rose again. I tried some switches, but 
there was no power in the capsule.  
‘Damn,’  I  said.  ‘No  lights,  no  radio,  no  fuel  gauge.  Only  the  altimeter’s  working.’  
‘Let’s  try  coming  down  on  the  beach,’  Per  said.  ‘We  can’t  risk  anywhere  inland.’  
I put on my life jacket and parachute, and attached the l ife raft to my belt. We saw the coastline 
approaching and Per vented hot air from the top of the balloon to reduce our height. But once again 
the ground wind was considerably stronger then we expected and it swept us out to sea. We were 
heading northeast, and without the radio or electricity in the capsule we were more than ever at the 
mercy of the wind.  
‘Hold  tight,’  Per  said.  
He let out more air, alternating this with burning propane to try to reduce the speed of our descent 
through the thick grey cloud. As we finally came out of the fog, I saw the foaming sea rising up to 
meet  us.  We’d  missed  the  beach.  We  were  going  far  too  fast.  I  realised  the  truth  of  Tom  Barrow’s  
words: it was like trying to stop a Sherman tank without brakes. With horror, I watched t he ocean 
rushing towards us.  
We hit the sea, crashing me into Per. We were tilted at a crazy angle, unable to stand upright. The 
balloon started to drag us across the surface of the ocean. We were being bounced from wave to wave.  
‘The  bolts!’  Per  shouted.  He grabbed hold of the chair and hauled himself upward. I tried to help push him to his feet, but 
the capsule was smashing up and down and each time I reached up I was knocked back. I watched 
Per’s  hand  stretch  out,  grasp  the  red  lever  and  pull  it  down.  Th is was supposed to fire the explosive 
bolts, which would sever the cables connecting the capsule to the balloon. In theory the balloon would 
then sail away and crumple into the sea, leaving the capsule to float on the water.  
But nothing happened. Per yanke d the lever up and down but the bolts did not fire.  
‘Jesus  Christ!’  Per  yelled.  ‘The  bolts  are  dead.’  
The balloon was now bouncing us across the Irish Sea like a monstrous beachball. I was knocked 
sideways again and hit the upturned edge of the flight deck . 
‘Get  out!’  Per  shouted  at  me.  ‘Richard,  we’ve  got  to  get  out.’  
Per braced himself against the hatch, wrenched down the levers and pushed it open. The balloon 
slowed for a moment as the capsule dug into the water, and Per heaved himself up and climbed 
through  the  hatch.  As  I  saw  Per’s  backside  squeeze  through  the  hatch  and  disappear  from  view,  I  
lunged after him and followed him up the rungs. I noticed that Per was still wearing his parachute. We 
clutched at the steel hawsers and tried to balance on the ti lting capsule.  
‘Where’s  your  life  jacket?’  I  shouted.  
Per  didn’t  seem  to  hear  me.  The  wind  and  the  roar  of  the  sea  blew  my  words  straight  back  into  
my face. The balloon was lurching at an angle, one side of it ploughing through the grey sea. It 
showed no s igns of slowing down. Behind us we left a foaming white wake. Then a gust of wind 
caught us and the balloon lifted off the surface.  
Per threw himself off the top of the capsule into the cold black water. The drop seemed at least 
100 feet. I was sure that h e’d  killed  himself.  
I  hesitated.  Then  I  realised  with  horror  that  I  was  too  late.  Without  Per’s  weight,  the  huge  balloon  
soared up. I almost fell backward over the edge of the capsule as it swung underneath the balloon like 
a pendulum. I ducked down, grabb ed hold of the railing and watched the grey sea fall away beneath 
me.  I  was  rising  rapidly,  and  I  couldn’t  see  Per.  Now  that  the  balloon  was  sailing  with  the  wind  and  no  
longer dragging the capsule through the water, it was much quieter. I watched with mou nting dread as 
I soared upward into thick cloud and lost sight of everything.  
I was now by myself, flying in the biggest balloon ever built, and heading towards Scotland. The 
wind was freezing cold; the sea below me was icy; and I was in thick fog. I had o nly the tiny 
emergency fuel tank left.  
I climbed back into the capsule. It was now the right way up and I felt reassured to see the 
screens and controls the way they had been as we crossed the Atlantic. I ran through the options: I 
could parachute into the  sea, where nobody would be likely to find me and I could drown; or I could 
sail up into the darkening sky and try a night landing, should I be lucky enough to reach land. I picked 
up the microphone, but the radio was still dead. I had no contact with the outside world.  The altimeter ticked down so I instinctively fired the propane. To my delight, the flame surged up 
inside the balloon and steadied it. I had assumed that the seawater had killed the burners. I gave a 
good long blast and the balloon started r ising again. I was having difficulty breathing so I put on an 
oxygen mask. I checked the altimeter: 12,000 feet. Thick white cloud pressed all around me. I had no 
sense of where I was. All I knew was that the grey foaming sea was waiting for me below. Befo re Per 
had ditched the balloon, he had told me that it was unlikely we had enough fuel to reach Scotland 
before  dark.  The  remaining  spare  fuel  tank  gave  me  only  about  an  hour’s  worth  of  flying.  Sooner  or  
later I would have to face the Irish Sea again.  
I wondered about the explosive bolts. Perhaps they had cut through one, two, three or even four 
of the five key cables that held the capsule to the balloon. Perhaps even now that last cable was 
straining and fraying under the weight and might give way. If so, the capsule would plunge straight 
down into the sea and I would be killed on impact. It was this fear which had prompted Per to jump. 
The capsule hatch was still open and I gave the propane one good long burn before climbing out once 
more on to the top of the capsule to look at the cables. It was now completely quiet. I could not see all 
the cables without leaning out over the capsule railings. Standing amid the swirling white cloud, I felt 
an overwhelming sense of loneliness. The cables looked intact so I squeezed back inside the hatch.  
Whatever I did in the next ten minutes would lead to my death or survival. I was on my own. We 
had broken the record but I was almost certainly going to die. Per, with no survival suit, was either 
dead or trying to swim on. I had to get somebody to find him. I had to survive. I cleared my mind and 
concentrated  on  the  options  in  front  of  me.  I  hadn’t  slept  for  over  24  hours  and  my  mind  felt  fuzzy.  I  
decided to take the balloon up high enough so I could parachute off the capsul e. I blasted the burners 
and  then  found  my  notebook  and  scrawled  across  the  open  page,  ‘Joan,  Holly,  Sam,  I  love  you.’  I  
waited until the altimeter showed 8,000 feet and then climbed outside.  
I was alone in the cloud. I crouched by the railings and looked down. I was still wheeling through 
the possibilities. If I jumped, I would be likely to have only two minutes to live. If I managed to open 
my parachute, I would still end up in the sea, where I would probably drown. I felt for the parachute 
release tag, a nd wondered whether it was the right one. Perhaps due to my dyslexia, I have a mental 
block about which is right and which is left, especially with parachutes. The last time I had free -fallen 
I pulled the wrong release tag and jettisoned my parachute. At t he time I had several skydivers around 
me, so they activated my reserve parachute. But now I was by myself at 8,000 feet. I slapped myself 
hard across the face to concentrate. There had to be a better way.  
‘Give  yourself  more  time,’  I  said  out  loud.  ‘Come   on.’ 
As I crouched on top of the capsule, I looked up at the vast balloon above me. The realisation 
dawned  that  I  was  standing  beneath  the  world’s  largest  parachute.  If  I  could  bring  the  balloon  down,  
then perhaps I could jump off into the sea at the last moment before we crashed. I now knew I had 
enough fuel for another thirty minutes. It must be better to live for thirty minutes than jump off with 
my parachute and perhaps live for only two minutes.  
‘While  I’m  alive  I  can  still  do  something,’  I  said.  ‘Some thing  must  turn  up.’  I climbed back inside and took off my parachute. I made up my mind. I would do anything for 
those extra minutes. I grabbed some chocolate, zipped it into my jacket pocket, and checked that my 
torch was still there.  
Peering out of the c apsule into the fog below me, I tried to work out when I should stop burning, 
when I should open the vent, and when I should leave the controls and climb out on top of the capsule 
for my final jump. I knew that I had to judge the last burn exactly so that the balloon would hit the sea 
as slowly as possible. Despite losing all our fuel tanks, the balloon was still carrying a weight of 
around three tonnes.  
As I came out through the bottom of the clouds, I saw the grey sea below me. I also saw an RAF 
helicopte r. I gave a last burn on the propane to slow my descent, and then left the balloon to come 
down of its own accord. I grabbed a red rag and climbed out through the hatch. I squatted on the top of 
the capsule and waved the rag at the helicopter pilot. He wav ed back rather casually, seemingly 
oblivious to my panic.  
I peered over the edge and saw the sea coming up. I shuffled around the capsule trying to work 
out where the wind was coming from. It was difficult to be sure since it seemed to be gusting from all 
directions. I finally chose the upwind side and looked down. I was fifty feet away, the height of a 
house, and the sea was racing up to hit me. I checked my life jacket and held on to the railing. Without 
my weight, I hoped the balloon would rise up again rather than crashing on top of me. I waited until I 
was just above the sea before pulling my life -jacket ripcord and hurling myself away from the capsule.  
The sea was icy. I spun deep into it and felt my scalp freeze with the water. Then the life jacket 
bobbed me straight back up to the surface. It was heaven: I was alive. I turned and watched the 
balloon. Without my weight, it quietly soared back up through the cloud like a magnificent alien 
spaceship, vanishing from sight.  
The helicopter flew over me and lowered a sling. I sat inside it like a swing, but each time it tried 
to  lift  me  it  dunked  me  back  in  the  water.  I  couldn’t  understand  what  was  wrong,  and  I  was  too  weak  
to hold on much longer. Eventually it winched me up and someone reached out and pulled  me inside.  
‘You  should  have  put  the  sling  under  your  arms,’  said  a  Scottish  voice.  
‘Where’s  Per?’  I  asked.  ‘Have  you  picked  up  Per  yet?’  
‘Isn’t  he  in  the  balloon?’  the  RAF  man  asked.  
‘Haven’t  you  got  him?  He’s  in  the  water.  He’s  been  there  ever  since  I  took  off  again.  About  forty  
minutes  ago.’  
The pilot pulled a face. He spoke to someone on the radio, but it was difficult to make out what 
was said. The helicopter spun on its axis and headed off.  
‘We’re  taking  you  to  our  boat,’  the  pilot  said.  
‘I  want  to  look  for  Per,’  I  said.  ‘I’m  fine.’  If he h ad survived the fall, Per would still be swimming – or, more likely, drowning – in the Irish 
Sea. The light was fading and, from the air, only his head would be visible. It was like looking for a 
football – a grey football in a grey stormy sea. The pilot t ook no notice of my arguments. Within two 
minutes we had landed on a ship and I was pulled on board. Without pausing for breath, the pilot took 
off immediately and headed back over the sea. I was marched across the deck and put into a hot bath. 
Then I went  up to the bridge to see how the search was going. For ten minutes, fifteen minutes, twenty 
minutes, there was nothing. Then the radio crackled.  
‘We’ve  spotted  him,’  the  pilot  said.  ‘And  he’s  still  swimming.  He’s  alive.’  
Per’s  struggles  weren’t  over.  The  w inch that had pulled me up was now jammed, and so they had 
to attract a dinghy to rescue him. By the time the dinghy arrived, Per was almost dead. He had been in 
the water for two hours, swimming as vigorously as possible to keep his circulation going, but  making 
no headway against the tide. He had no life vest on, and by the time of his rescue he was completely 
frozen   and   exhausted.   It   was   extraordinary   that   he’d   survived,   and   he   later   put   it   down   to   his  
experiences as a child, being forced by his father t o swim every day in the icy lakes of Sweden.  
We  met  on  board  the  ship,  and  fell  into  each  other’s  arms.  Per  had  been  stripped  naked  and  wore  
a  survival  blanket.  His  face  looked  like  white  marble.  He  was  blue  with  cold  and  he  couldn’t  stop  his  
teeth chatter ing. 
For what it was worth, we were the first to cross the Atlantic in a hot -air balloon. More 
importantly, we were alive. We could not believe that we had both survived.  
During the summer of 1987 British Caledonian had been struggling to stay in business.  It took out a 
series  of  advertisements  which  showed  businessmen  singing  ‘I  wish  they  all  could  be  Caledonian  
girls’  to  the  tune  of  The  Beach  Boys’  ‘California  Girls’,  and  they  made  a  great  play  about  their  cabin  
crew’s   tartan.   But   it   was   no   good:   British   Caledonian were losing money and in August they 
announced that they had agreed terms for British Airways to take them over.  
It seemed to me that this takeover clearly breached the strictures of the Monopolies and Mergers 
Commission in that it was the large st and the second largest UK carriers forming one company with a 
market share across the Atlantic of well over 50 per cent. We complained to the Commission that this 
deal  increased  BA’s  share  from  around  45  per  cent  to  80  per  cent  on  several  transatlantic   routes, but 
the deal was still given the go -ahead in September. BA and B -Cal made great play that B -Cal would 
be run independently and the B -Cal cabin crew would continue to wear their tartan uniforms and 
retain their independence. Without B -Cal offering c ompetition, BA could now turn its full attention to 
mopping up the last tiny British competitor – us – and then concentrate on dominating the Atlantic 
routes.  
As the BA/B -Cal deal went ahead we realised that, as well as the threat that a larger BA would 
pose to us, this takeover could contain a hidden opportunity for us. We had already used the increased 
value of our first jumbo, which had risen in worth by $10 million, to leverage up and lease a second 
plane, which we were flying to Miami. We wanted to exp and further. Under the terms of the Bermuda 
Agreement, which governs international air traffic between America and Britain, there is provision for 
two British carriers between America and Britain. Our lawyers also discovered that the Japanese 
intergovernme ntal agreement contained the provision for two British and two Japanese carriers to Japan. With B -Cal removed from the scene, Virgin Atlantic was now free to push itself forward and 
apply to fly these routes as the second carrier.  
Just as surely as Mike Ol dfield and The Sex Pistols had been turning points for Virgin Music, 
BA’s  takeover  of  B -Cal was a turning point for Virgin Atlantic. Prior to their merger, we flew only to 
Miami and Newark Airport near New York. Now, as the second British long -haul carrier , Virgin 
Atlantic was entitled to apply for the routes that B -Cal had served and were duplicated by the BA/B -
Cal alliance. Top of our list was to fly to JFK, the main airport at New York; Los Angeles; and Tokyo. 
Further down, we listed three other destinat ions that B -Cal had operated: San Francisco, Boston and 
Hong Kong. In 1987 we had just two aircraft. In order to fly to Los Angeles and Tokyo we would 
have to lease two more aircraft and double the number of our cabin crew.  
In the meantime, as well as stal king B -Cal’s  routes,  we  were  also  continuing  to  stalk  Thorn  EMI.  
In the last week of September, Trevor had finalised our £100 million loan with the Bank of Nova 
Scotia. Despite the stock market rising all summer, we felt that Thorn EMI was still undervalue d. 
With £100 million at our disposal, we started buying on 25 September 1987. Undaunted by the size of 
EMI, we started putting in buying orders for 100,000 shares at a time. We decided to buy up to 5 per 
cent of the company before announcing our takeover b id. Even if our bid failed, we knew that in the 
long run the 5 per cent stake would increase in value.  
Immediately rumours started going around the market that Thorn EMI was going to be bid for. 
Some days we bought 250,000 shares, costing us £1.75 million;  other days we spent £5 million. 
Sometimes we sold shares to keep people guessing. We were stirring up the pot and ensuring that a 
high number of Thorn EMI shares were traded, which kept the bid rumours going. By the second 
week of October, our shareholdin gs had cost £30 million.  
During the night of Thursday 15 October 1987 there was a hurricane in Britain. I remember 
walking from Oxford Gardens to Duende  and looking across the green streets – they were carpeted 
with leaves. With so few people able to get t o work as a result, the stock market was closed on Friday. 
But, in America, the selling of shares which had started on Wednesday became a stampede. I watched 
with amazement through Friday evening as the Dow Jones fell 95 points, then its largest one -day fa ll. 
The  full  significance  of  Wall  Street’s  crash  did  not  really  hit  London  and  the  rest  of  the  world  until  
Monday. The Sunday newspapers were full of optimistic noises, and even encouraged their readers to 
buy as many BP shares as they could. On Monday the  Australian market was the first to open and fell 
by a fifth; Tokyo fell 1,500 points. I thought that this was a great opportunity to buy more Thorn EMI 
shares, and I called up our broker and asked him to buy £5 million worth of Thorn EMI shares first 
thing. I wanted to get in there before anyone else and I was worried that someone else might have 
seized  the  opportunity.  In  the  event  I  needn’t  have  bothered.  I  don’t  think  that  anyone  could  believe  
their luck that there was a buyer in the market. The broker filled his order within twenty seconds, and 
asked me if I wanted to buy any more.  
‘There’re  tons  more  of  it  where  that  came  from,’  he  said.  
Finally sensing a crisis, I paused. Even as I thought about it, the London stock market fell by 100 
points, then ano ther 100 points, then another 50 points – a  full  day’s  fall  of  250  points.  That  afternoon  
the Dow Jones crashed by another 500 points. Within a three -day period, the world stock markets lost 
around a quarter of their value.  Trevor and I got together. For m e the immediate damage was that the price of Virgin had nearly 
halved in value from 160 pence to 90 pence. Someone worked out that I had lost £41 million in value 
on my shares in Virgin Group plc. The actual picture was much worse than this. The share pric e of 
Thorn EMI had dropped from £7.30 to £5.80, a drop of over 20 per cent, and the value of our 
shareholding had crashed to £18 million.  
The Bank of Nova Scotia was unamused. With the crash in share prices, they asked for an 
immediate cash payment of £5 m illion. Oddly enough, I was still rather confident about buying Thorn 
EMI.  I  felt  unaffected  by  the  slump  in  Virgin’s  own  share  price  since  I  was  never  going  to  sell  my  
shares anyway, and I was absolutely certain that the share price was grossly undervalue d. And, since I 
was focusing more on the profits and cash flow from EMI, I began to see the stock -market crash as a 
golden opportunity to buy the company. But Mountleigh were blown apart by the crash – their share 
price collapsed by 60 per cent and they we re unable to borrow any more money to buy shares in Thorn 
EMI, or anyone else for that matter.  
That week I had a furious argument with the two nonexecutive directors whom we had brought in 
to  represent  the  outside  shareholders’  interests  when  Virgin  went  p ublic. Sir Phil Harris and Cob 
Stenham were utterly opposed to continuing the siege of Thorn EMI and announcing a bid when we 
released our results later in October.  
‘But  it’s  a  unique  buying  opportunity,’  I  said.  ‘It  simply  cannot  be  true  that  Thorn  is  now  worth 
only two -thirds of its value on Friday. We know the cash we can earn from its back catalogue, so in 
terms  of  straight  cash  to  us  it’s  a  bargain.’  
‘There  could  be  tough  times  ahead,’  they  warned  me.  ‘This  crash  has  changed  the  whole  picture.’  
‘But  the  people  who  buy  records  won’t  stop,’  I  said.  ‘Most  people  don’t  hold  any  shares  anyway.  
They’ll  carry  on  buying  Beatles  and  Phil  Collins  albums.’  
But everyone disagreed with me. They all wanted to see where the stock market went next. The 
Thorn EMI share price continued to fall until it reached £5.30. I was sure that, if we could present a 
united front, then we would be able to raise the money and buy Thorn EMI at a bargain price. I argued 
that there was no good reason for the crash, and that share prices would recover soon. I told them that 
there would never again be such a wonderful opportunity. But they all disagreed, and since I could not 
persuade them I had to let the matter drop. I expected the Virgin share price to jump up when we 
released our result s.  And  so,  when  we  announced  that  Virgin’s  profits  for  the  year  ended  July  1987  
had more than doubled from £14 million to £32 million, we made no reference to Thorn EMI. As it 
happened, our share price did not move upward. Anything but. It was difficult to  understand how 
Virgin could have floated with a share price of 140 pence the previous year, and then our share price 
be halved on the back of doubled profits.  
The stock -market  crash  was  the  final  nail  in  Virgin’s  coffin  as  a  public  company.  I  knew  that  Do n 
would be opposed to changing direction, but Trevor and I had a quiet chat about the logistics of going 
private again, and Trevor set about working out the finances that such a large buy -back would entail.  
In July 1988 we announced that the management of Virgin would conduct a management buyout 
of Virgin Group plc. We could probably have got away with paying less than the original 140 pence 
per share, but we decided we would offer the same price we had sold the Group for on the stock market, a large premiu m over the 70 pence at which shares were changing hands just before our 
announcement. This meant that nobody who had invested in Virgin when it was floated – all those 
people in the queue outside the bank who had wished me well – would lose money. Our repu tation 
would stay intact.  
Trevor renegotiated the entire financial structure of the Virgin Group, and set in place the 
mechanics for going private at the end of November 1988. It was a colossal task made no easier when 
our advisers, Samuel Montagu, approac hed their parent bank, Midland Bank, to come and join the 
syndicate of lending banks, but were turned down out of hand.  
Trevor  decided  to  dispense  with  Samuel  Montagu’s  services  in  all  but  name.  Rather  than  set  up  a  
syndicate of banks which would have had one leading bank as the point of contact and prime 
negotiator, he began to pull together a consortium of banks, each of whom he approached directly. 
This meant that he would have to do much more legwork, since he was speaking to them all 
individually, but it also meant that he could play each of them off against the others. In the end he 
arranged lines of credit with twenty different banks, and we drew up an overdraft of £300 million. We 
bought  in  the  outside  shareholders’  shares,  refinanced  the  debt  which   had been secured upon our 
Virgin Group plc shares, and similarly for Virgin Atlantic.  
With over £300 million of debt, we were so heavily borrowed that we knew we had to move 
rapidly if we were going to survive. We had to give up the idea of buying Thorn EM I, so we sold our 
shares, and concentrated on dealing with our own problems. I had always felt that the City had 
undervalued Virgin Music, and now we would have to see what its real value was. Don Cruickshank, 
Sir Phil Harris and Cob Stenham left Virgin. D on had carried out a superb job in recasting the 
company as one that could demonstrate clear lines of management. Trevor took his place as managing 
director.  
Trevor and I set about finding other companies who might wish to invest in any of the Virgin 
subsidiaries as joint ventures. We wanted to replace the shareholders in the City with one or two key 
partners in various Virgin subsidiaries. The structure of the  Virgin Group was about to become 
extremely complicated.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 18 ‘Everything  was  up  for  sale.’  
1988 –1989  
WHEN I HAD BOUGHT  back  Nik’s  40  per  cent  stake,  I  had  been  able  to  repay  my  £1  million  
overdraft because Virgin had suddenly released a string of hits start ing off with Phil Collins. At the 
time I knew I was on a knife edge. Now the sums of money were far more daunting: we had a debt 
mountain of over £300 million, and we had to reduce it by £200 million within the first year. This 
pressure meant that everythi ng was now up for sale. There were no sacred cows. If we received a good 
offer for a part of any Virgin business, then we would take it. Trevor, Ken and I began to put out 
feelers to see what level of interest there was. One of the first areas we looked at  was Virgin Retail.  
Trevor and I divided Virgin Retail into three separate divisions: the first comprised the rump of 
the record shops that we had kept back from selling to WH Smith, the typical high -street shops 
together with the Oxford Street Megastore; the  second  comprised  Patrick  Zelnick’s  proposed  Paris  
Megastore on the Champs Elysées, where Patrick Zelnick would set up a separate French subsidiary to 
invest in the shop; the third comprised the plans we had for Ian Duffell, the man who had designed 
and set up the HMV record shop on Oxford Street, and whom we had managed to persuade to join 
Virgin.  
We offered him the chance to set up Virgin Megastores anywhere in the world, and we promised 
to back his judgement and let him have a direct share in the Mega stores. Ian was one of the best record 
retailers in the business: he had excellent plans for the record shops and, for the first time since we 
opened our earliest batch of Virgin shops, I felt that we could be back on the map. His interest lay in 
opening a  sequence of overseas Virgin Megastores.  
We thought about setting up in America, but the retail rents at the time were astronomical and the 
competition was high. Instead we chose to open the first one in Sydney, which was a quiet market 
without much compet ition. There we could open a Megastore and experiment a little with different 
formulas without losing a lot of money.  
In the meantime, the Paris Megastore was the first overseas shop to materialise. Patrick had 
found a grand old bank dating from the late n ineteenth century. It had marble floors, soaring high 
ceilings and the most spectacular staircase. This grabbed my imagination. We knew that small record 
shops did not make enough money; they just attracted passers -by who were disappointed by the lack 
of depth of stock. Now that the 1970s were over and the cushions on the floor had been cleared away, 
the traditional Virgin shops seemed to have lost their identity and customer loyalty. We had to go for 
something bigger, where we could offer the best range of  products in the world.  
Patrick’s  Paris  Megastore  was  an  incredible  success.  From  its  opening  day  it  smashed  all  his  sales  
forecasts and became the most celebrated shop in Paris. Indeed, it became far more than a shop: it 
became a landmark and a tourist destination. After a few m onths the Paris Megastore attracted as 
many visitors as the Louvre. Today it still generates sales per square foot over twice those of any other 
record store in the world. It seems that every teenaged Japanese and German tourist makes a 
pilgrimage there an d buys huge numbers of CDs, and even the café at the top has become a smart 
place for French executives to meet. I was delighted for Patrick, but I still had no idea what to do 
about the British record shops.  We decided that it was time to bring some other  people in to turn Virgin Retail around. Giving 
people their notice is always heart -wrenching, and I hate doing it. I hate confrontation and I hate 
disappointing people. I always try to give people another chance. But it was clear that this team was 
out of  its depth and losing money without any hope of turning the company round. The final straw 
came when, after the end of the financial year, they admitted to us that the losses of Virgin Retail 
would be £2 million more than they had anticipated. By leaving i t so late we were stuck.  
We asked some head -hunters to draw up a short list of suitable candidates, but I was most 
intrigued when Simon Burke applied for the job of chief executive. Simon had joined Virgin a couple 
of years previously as the development ma nager. His job was to sift through all the business proposals 
we receive and see whether we want to follow any of them up.  
One of the things that I am always trying to do with Virgin is make people reinvent themselves. I 
firmly believe that anything is pos sible  and,  despite  Simon’s  having  no  obvious  qualifications  to  turn  a  
large chain of unsuccessful record shops into a chain of successful ones, I was certain that, if anyone 
could do it, he could. And, sure enough, as soon as Simon started work at Virgin R etail in August 
1988,  things  began  to  change  as  he  started  to  weed  out  everything  we  didn’t  need  or  that  was  losing  
money.  
His strategy began to pay off, and by June 1989 Virgin Retail had produced its first ever profit. In 
his first presentation to the Vi rgin board he showed us some slides and asked for £10 million to invest 
in new shops. He pointed out that Retail was falling apart, and he showed us some pictures of the 
shops in which tiles were hanging off the roof and the wiring was coming apart. He sug gested that, if 
any airline customers saw this, they would worry about the state of the aircraft. Unfortunately for 
Simon, Patrick Zelnick was also asking for £10 million, to develop Virgin Megastores in Bordeaux 
and Marseilles. Flushed with the recent suc cess of the Paris Megastore, I felt more inclined to divert 
the funding to France than the UK. It must have been galling for Simon. In the meantime, the Sydney 
Megastore was ready to open, and Ian and Mike were looking at Japan.  
In order to create the inve stment in the UK shops and help pay off the general debt, we set up 
another joint venture. Ideally we would have liked a financial investor to take a 30 per cent stake but, 
with the high interest rates and the feeling that high -street retailing was heading  for recession, we had 
no  takers.  We  began  talks  with  Kingfisher,  the  owner  of  Woolworth’s.  As  these  talks  dragged  on,  WH  
Smith got wind of them and called me to see whether they could make an offer. And so, just as Simon 
Burke was getting on with the job of sorting out Virgin Retail for Virgin, he suddenly found himself 
with a new boss: a two -headed creature comprising both Virgin and WH Smith. WH Smith bought a 
50 per cent stake in our ten UK Megastores, which, unlike the earlier shops we had sold to WH S mith, 
continued to trade under the Virgin name. Their sale raised £12 million, which we immediately used 
to pay off borrowings in Virgin Atlantic. It was another case of some frantic juggling to keep one step 
ahead of the bankers.  
While the UK retail arm s pun off into a joint venture with WH Smith, and the European retail side 
started to expand from Paris into Bordeaux, Marseilles and then Germany, several different Virgin 
companies turned their attention towards Japan.  
While many British companies complain  about how difficult it is to do business in Japan, Virgin 
has always enjoyed an excellent rapport with the Japanese. I put it down to the success of my first ever trip to Tokyo. I had gone there as a twenty -year-old, before I was married to Kristen, and r ather 
ambitiously arranged a number of meetings with people in the entertainment and media world to see 
whether we could set up some kind of joint venture distributing records. I think it was before we 
started  Virgin  Music,  so  I  didn’t  even  have  Mike  Oldfi eld to sell them. I was young, impoverished and 
had very little to offer. I went along to a number of meetings where immaculate geisha girls served 
tea, and I sat in my jeans and sweater and enthused about business to kind and patient groups of 
Japanese bu sinessmen. No business deals were forthcoming, but the great success was at my hotel.  
When I arrived at the airport and took a coach into Tokyo, I realised that I could not afford to 
stay at any of the hotels on the list suggested by the tourist board. So I took a taxi and asked for a 
cheap local hotel. The hotel looked utterly anonymous from the outside, just a plain little concrete 
building, and my room was very small. But that night, bored and alone, I saw that room service 
offered a massage. Two beautif ul Japanese girls came up to my room, where they asked me to lie in 
the bath and gave me the most erotic massage of my life. We all ended up in my bath tub. When I 
breathlessly called up for a massage the next night to repeat the experience, I was confront ed by two 
huge women in severe aprons who explained that the other two girls were having a night off. They 
proceeded to karate chop and pummel me to within an inch of my life. Nowadays I am booked into 
huge hotels which are very nice, but nothing compares with that first business trip.  
By 1988 Virgin had become quite a well -known brand name in Japan. Several of our artists sold 
well there, particularly Boy George, The Human League, Simple Minds and Phil Collins. After the 
British Airways takeover of British  Caledonian, we successfully applied for the right to fly to Tokyo. 
When we looked at ways of reducing our overdraft, we realised that we would have to sell shares in 
both Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Music in order to reduce our mountain of debt.  
Our first deal was to sell 10 per cent of the airline to Seibu -Saison, a large Japanese travel group. 
Virgin Atlantic had just announced doubled pre -tax profits of £10 million, and Seibu -Saison bought 
the 10 per cent stake for £36 million. At the same time as this d eal was going through, Robert 
Devereux was signing up a longer -term contract with Sega for Virgin Communications to distribute 
Sega games. It was becoming clear that Japanese companies shared much of the same philosophy as 
Virgin.  
Like us, they tend to ope rate on long -term objectives. As well as the constrictions of having to 
report to nonexecutive directors and shareholders, one of my main frustrations with being a public 
company quoted on the stock market was the short -term view which investors took. We w ere under 
pressure to produce instant results, and unless we paid out a large dividend our share price would 
suffer. Japanese investors do not invest with the dividend payment in mind; they look almost 
exclusively for capital growth. And, given that it can  take a long time for investments to pay off, 
Japanese  share  prices  are  very  high  in  comparison  with  the  company’s  earnings.  Hence,  Japanese  
price -earnings ratios are often three times as high as British ones. I once heard of a Japanese company 
that was wo rking to a 200 -year  business  plan!  It  reminds  me  of  Deng  Xiaoping’s  remark  in  the  1980s,  
when  he  was  asked  what  he  thought  the  implications  of  the  1789  French  Revolution  were.  ‘Too  early  
to  tell’  was  his  reply.  
The next part of the Virgin Group to embrace a Japanese partner was Virgin Music. This was the 
key sale. If we were going to make any sense of having bought back Virgin Group plc, then we had to 
raise a good price for Virgin Music. Simon, Trevor and I spoke to a number of American companies about tak ing a stake in Virgin Music. One of them offered the most money but was not prepared to 
take the role of a passive, long -term investor. We all gravitated towards a Japanese media company, 
Fujisankei. I think my mind was made up at a meeting with Mr Agichi of Fujisankei in the garden of 
our house at 11 Holland Park.  
‘Mr  Branson,’  came  the  quiet  question.  ‘Would  you  prefer  an  American  wife  or  a  Japanese  wife?  
American wives very difficult – lots  of  litigation  and  alimony.  Japanese  wives  very  good  and  quiet.’  
 
 
19 Preparing to jump  
1989 –1990  
BY SELLING 25 PER CENT  of Virgin Music for $150 million – £100 million – we had vindicated 
our argument that the City had undervalued Virgin. The sale was a clear sign that that company alone 
was worth at least £400 million, and that was without any value at all placed on the various other 
companies, such as Retail, which had made up the public Group. This was way above the £180 million 
at which the City had valued us before we offered to buy the company back, and still way ab ove the 
£240 million price we had eventually paid to go private.  
With Japanese partners in our two main businesses, the airline and music, we then turned to our 
third business and decided to expand the retail side in Japan as well. Ian Duffell and Mike Inm an, 
along with our Japanese adviser, Shu Ueyama, had already started to do their research. Mike had 
started learning Japanese in Sydney because his brother had married a Japanese girl. Ian sent him to 
Tokyo, and he himself headed to Los Angeles, where he s tarted looking for a Megastore site along 
Sunset Boulevard.  
Mike reported that it would be impossible to set up a Megastore in Tokyo by ourselves: Tokyo is 
a vast city with few distinguishable regions, and it is extremely difficult for outsiders to identif y the 
key parts. Retail, residential and commercial properties are all jumbled up together, unlike in London, 
which has easily definable shopping areas – like Oxford Street, Knights -bridge and Kensington High 
Street – and where it is relatively easy to get  your bearings. Tokyo all looks the same. Property is 
extremely  expensive,  and  in  order  to  rent  a  shop  you  have  to  put  down  a  huge  deposit  called  ‘key  
money’.  Trevor,  Ian  and  Shu  had  met  up  with  a  great  many  potential  Japanese  partners,  and  eventually  
chose to team up with a fashion retailer called Marui. Trevor formed a fifty -fifty partnership which 
would be the start of Virgin Megastores in Japan.  
The difficulty with a record shop is that you are trying to sell an identical product to that of every 
other record shop. Virgin had nothing that we could call our own or that was available only at Virgin 
shops. We knew that our competitors were losing a l ot of money in Tokyo, partly because they had 
had to pay such high key -money deposits on their shops, but also because they had not established any 
customer loyalty and so did not get the vital return visits.   
  
In order to avoid these pitfalls, we set up the joint venture with Marui. They were the first retailer 
really to understand the importance of railway stations. They positioned their stores as close as 
possible to the large railway stations, and so ensured a  vast  crowd  of  passing  pedestrians.  Marui’s  
clothes were aimed at the young, increasingly affluent generation and they had also pioneered a 
popular in -house credit card. Marui managed to secure us a fabulous site in Shinjuku, a prime 
shopping area in cent ral Tokyo, and we took 10,000 square feet. The property belonged to Marui and 
we agreed a system whereby we paid them a certain percentage of our sales instead of a fixed monthly 
rent. In this way we avoided paying the ruinous key -money deposit and, althou gh 10,000 square feet 
was small by European standards, it was still larger than any other record shop in Tokyo. It was the 
flagship store I wanted.  
In order to be different from our competitors, and to attract customers, we installed listening 
facilities a nd hired a DJ. The DJ was not only an entertainer: by playing great songs he soon covered 
his costs by triggering sales. The Tokyo Virgin Megastore soon acquired the same kind of cult status 
as the early shops in Oxford Street and Notting Hill. Teenagers f rom across the city flocked there and 
it became the place to go. Tokyo is an expensive city and so teenagers enjoyed being able to spend a 
cheap afternoon listening to music, chatting and buying records. The average time spent in our Tokyo 
Megastores was f orty minutes – considerably  longer  than  people  spend  having  a  meal  in  McDonald’s.  
It was almost an extension of our original 1970s retail philosophy. With 10,000 customers a day, the 
store was even more successful than we had expected.  
With Ian in Los Ange les,  Mike  was  by  himself.  In  due  course,  he  followed  in  his  brother’s  
footsteps by falling in love with a Japanese girl. They got married on Necker Island.  
Within the space of two years, between 1988 and 1990, each Virgin subsidiary had set up a deal 
with a Japanese company. With Sega, Marui, Seibu -Saison and Fujisankei, we were uniquely placed 
to begin expanding in Japan. I was also about to become involved in an altogether different venture in 
Japan: Per and I were planning to take off from Japan and fly across the Pacific to America in our 
second hot -air-balloon adventure.  
Per told me his worst fear when it was too late. We were on the plane on our way to Japan when he 
confessed that he had been unable to test the capsule in a pressure chamber: he was not  100 per cent 
sure that it would survive at 40,000 feet. If a window blew out at that height, we would have between 
seven and eight seconds to put on our oxygen masks.  
‘We’ll  need  to  keep  them  handy,’  Per  said  in  his  usual  understated  way.  ‘And,  of  course,  if the 
other  person  is  asleep  then  it’ll  be  necessary  to  put  the  mask  on  and  get  it  going  in  three  seconds  and  
then  put  on  the  other  person’s  in  three  seconds,  allowing  two  seconds  for  a  fumble.’  
I  didn’t  fancy  a  fumble  with  Per,  even  for  two  seconds,  and  I  vowed  that  I  wouldn’t  go  to  sleep  
during the flight.  
‘Will  we  have  any  advance  warning  about  it?’  I  asked.  
‘If  the  capsule  decompresses,  you’ll  notice  that  it  suddenly  becomes  misty.  The  capsule  will  
appear to fill with fog. You will hear a screaming in  your ears and you will experience the sensation of 
your  lungs  being  sucked  out  of  your  chest  and  through  your  mouth.’  
When  a  journalist  asked  me  about  the  dangers  of  the  flight,  I  recounted  Per’s  words.  
‘You  see,  it’s  essential  that  one  of  us  stays  awake   during  the  flight,’  I  told  the  journalist.  ‘So,  
rather  than  using  the  comfortable  Virgin  seats  which  we  used  to  cross  the  Atlantic,  we’ve  asked  
British  Airways  for  two  of  theirs.’  
We were attempting the flight in November, when the jet stream across the Pa cific is at its 
strongest. However, it is also the time of year when the ocean is extremely stormy. We would take off 
from Japan and almost immediately be above the sea. We would then have to more than double our 
Atlantic distance record of 3,000 miles in order to reach America.  
Per’s  team  had  taken  the  balloon  and  capsule  to  the  launch  site  in  Miyakonojo,  a  small  town  in  
the south of Japan which they had calculated lay directly below the jet stream. On my first night there 
I was called by Tom Barrow, who h ad fallen out with Per since the Atlantic crossing. We had replaced 
Tom  with  Mike  Kendrick,  but  Tom  had  been  following  Per’s  progress  and  was  extremely  worried.  
‘You’re  going  to  end  up  in  the  water,’  he  told  me.  ‘Your  first  priority  is  to  be  prepared  for  a  safe, 
survivable  ditch  in  the  sea.  If,  against  all  odds,  you  reach  the  mainland,  you’ll  have  a  60  per  cent  
chance  that  it’ll  be  dark.  In  November  it’s  dark  for  fifteen  hours  of  the  day  in  North  America,  
particularly  the  further  north  you  go.  You  can’t  lan d in the dark, so you may well have to fly for 
another  fifteen  hours.  Even  at  30  miles  an  hour  this’ll  take  you  1,000  miles  inland  and  you  could  well  
be  in  trouble  then.  You  should  assume  that  there’ll  be  storm  conditions   – it’s  hardly  likely  to  be  a  still , 
calm day. Up in the north you get people trapped in cabins waiting for the weather to clear, so for 
God’s  sake  have  your  search  and  rescue  team  in  place.  Don’t  be  dependent  on  calm  weather  for  your  
landing.  ‘Check   all   the   systems   before   you   take   off.   Don ’t   get   pressured   into   taking   off.   Even   if  
everything’s  well  built  and  works,  the  flight  is  still  terribly  dangerous.’  
I thanked Tom for his advice.  
‘My  last  word  on  the  matter,’  he  told  me.  ‘The  Atlantic  crossing  was  a  successful  flight  that  was  
out of con trol. We all know that. It was fully out of control at the end, but both of you survived. You 
both taught yourselves to fly that balloon as you went along. In the Atlantic you can ditch near a boat. 
In  the  Pacific  you’re  dead.  So  you’ll  either  ditch  in  the  sea  and  die,  or  you’ll  hit  land  in  the  dark  and  
that’ll  be  a  close  call.’  
I  put  down  the  telephone.  I  was  sweating.  I  had  hardly  finished  scribbling  down  what  he’d  told  
me  when  it  rang  again.  It  was  Joan.  It  was  Holly’s  eighth  birthday.  She  came  on  the  li ne: 
‘I’m  keeping  a  diary,  Dad,’  she  told  me.  ‘We  can  swap  diaries  when  you  come  home.’  
‘Yes,  darling,’  I  said,  swallowing  hard.  
When I mentioned to Per the improbability of surviving if we ditched in the sea, he agreed.  
‘We  don’t  need  to  bother  with  health  insurance,’  he  said  casually.  ‘It’s  only  worthwhile  taking  
out  life  insurance.’  
As  Per’s  team  assembled  the  electrical  systems  in  the  capsule,  Per  and  I  sat  down  together  and  
went through the flight operations. It was hard to believe that we were going to  be once again 
incarcerated in this tiny capsule, surrounded by all these gadgets – which were our only means of 
communication with the outside world.  
‘Look,’  I  found  myself  saying  to  a  reporter  who  was  running  through  a  list  of  everything  that  
could go wr ong,  ‘it’ll  either  be  a  piece  of  cake  or  it  won’t.’  
The jet stream above the Pacific is a different shape from the one above the Atlantic. The Atlantic 
one is a V -shaped polar jet stream, like an upside -down Toblerone. As you rise, the jet stream 
becomes wider and the wind becomes faster, so you gradually i ncrease your groundspeed. At 10,000 
feet the air current might be 50 knots, then at 27,000 feet it will be 100 knots, and so on. A balloon can 
ease into it without being buffeted. The Pacific jet stream is a different beast altogether. It is a 
subtropical jet shaped like a single -bore cable. At 20,000 feet the air current could be completely still. 
At 25,000 feet it could be the same. Then suddenly at 27,000 feet you hit the jet stream, which is 
moving at between 100 and 200 knots. Nobody had ever flown a b alloon in the Pacific jet stream 
before, and we knew there was a danger that when the top of our balloon hit the current it could be 
sheared  off  from  the  capsule  suspended  below.  If  that  didn’t  happen  we  knew  it  would  be  a  pretty  
rough buffeting. With the capsule travelling at 5 knots and the balloon at 200 knots, we knew it would 
initially be like being pulled along by a thousand horses.  
If we managed to get into the jet stream, we knew that it would have an inner core which is 
generally about 4,000 feet i n diameter. To keep within this tube would mean constantly monitoring the 
altimeter, and watching out for any buffeting which would imply that the balloon and capsule were in 
different streams.  The atmosphere at Miyakonojo was almost like a carnival. A Shi nto priest even came to bless the site. 
My parents had arrived, but Joan had chosen to stay at home until the balloon went up and then take a 
plane to Los Angeles so that she and the children could meet me at the end of the flight. By Sunday 
night our weat herman, Bob Rice, was forecasting perfect conditions for Tuesday, but by Monday 
these had been delayed to Wednesday. Per and I spent another day in the capsule going over and over 
everything that could go wrong.  
‘Keep  the  fire  burning   – that’s  all  that  mat ters,’  I  wrote  across  a  page  in  my  notebook  after  one  
three -hour session on all the possible outcomes of our flight.  
The delay gave me the chance to revisit the banks of dials, gauges and switches built into the 
capsule walls. It also gave me time to make sure that I remembered the difference between the 
switches that released the empty fuel tanks and the ones that separated the balloon from the capsule!  
‘It’s  code  yellow,’  Bob  Rice  announced.  ‘Expect  a  green  light  by  2100  hours,  November  23rd.’  
‘Is  the  Pac ific  Ocean  the  largest  ocean  in  the  world?’  asked  Holly  down  the  telephone.  ‘How  
many  miles  is  it?  And  how  long  would  it  take  you  to  fly  all  round  the  world?’  
It  was  time  for  a  sleep.  I  lay  on  my  hotel  bed  but  couldn’t  keep  my  eyes  shut,  and  so  I  started  t o 
write in my diary:  
Trying  to  have  a  couple  of  hours’  rest.  Failing  miserably.  Just  looked  out  of  the  window  to  see  
the end of a beautiful day. The smoke from the volcano looks like thin cloud in the sky. Cars with 
loudspeakers going through the streets  announcing the time of our departure. Civic fireworks 
planned for 2.30a.m. for anybody from the town not already awake. Imagine an English city 
council doing that! Still not feeling nervous: elated, excited, but not really nervous. Everything 
seems to hav e gone so well. Bob feels the crossing and landing conditions are nearly as good as 
we can expect. Still have some nervousness about the inflation. In two hours must go back to site 
for a live interview for News at One . 
When I went back to the site I sense d  trouble.  The  balloon’s  envelope  was  still  laid  out  on  the  
ground:  inflation  had  not  started.  The  operation  room  was  full  of  Per’s  team  being  debriefed:  ‘Too  
windy,  too  risky,  too  much  downwind.’  They  decided  to  leave  the  envelope  laid  out  on  the  ground  a nd 
hope that the wind fell away by the next night. With the 70 -tonne balloon stationary, a gust of wind 
could rip the fabric. I went back outside and asked for our translator. Somebody gave me a 
microphone and I apologised to the huge crowd huddled on the hillside above the launch site. We 
promised to try tomorrow.  
The next day was long and listless. The jet stream seemed to be behaving peculiarly and Bob 
Rice was struggling to work out whether we would land in California or Yukon.  
‘Oh,  fuck  the  weather,’  B ob,  America’s  most  renowned  and  sophisticated  meteorologist,  finally  
said.  ‘Just  go!’  
I went back to the hotel for a final sleep, and once again I ended up staring out of the window at 
the volcano. I heard the drummers starting in town. Then a fax was push ed under my door. In spidery, 
slanting letters, Holly had written:  I  hope  you  don’t  land  in  the  water  and  have  a  bad  landing.  I  hope  you  have  a  good  landing  and  
land on dry land, and Miss Salavesen said to have a good landing too. I hope you have a nice trip. 
Love from Holly.  
PS. Good luck and I love you too.  
I took a sleeping pill and fell on to my bed.  
A few hours later Per woke me up and we drove to the site. A crowd of around 5,000 people had 
come out to watch in the freezing cold. There were families, old ladies, young babies. I heard cheers 
as the balloon rose from the ground and swung up above the c apsule. The burners were roaring now to 
heat up the air. The wind was still, but we needed to take off as soon as possible in case any gusts 
caught us on the ground. Hundreds of coal braziers had been brought out on to the slope. Their smoke 
rose straight up into the starry night air – clear proof of how absolutely still it was.  
I was standing with my parents admiring the magnificence of the balloon when a strip of the 
fabric suddenly peeled off the envelope and hung down.  
‘What’s  that?’  Dad  asked  me.  
I ran to find Per.  
‘What’s  happening?’  
‘Nothing  to  worry  about,’  Per  said.  ‘Just  a  little  heat  loss.  The  balloon’s  big  enough  to  cope.’  
I  took  Per  back  into  the  operation  room  and  Dad  grabbed  his  arm.  ‘What’s  that  flapping  off  
halfway  up  the  envelope?’  he  said.  
‘It’s  air  coming  up  the  side  of  the  balloon,’  Per  said.  
Dad  didn’t  look  convinced.  
Per and I walked out and stood underneath the balloon. It effectively had a hole where the 
lamination had peeled off. We went back to the control room and I found Dad.  
‘Dad,  don’t  tell  Mum,’  I  said,  ‘but  we’ve  got  a  hole.  Per  still  feels  we’ll  make  it  to  America.’  
‘You  can’t  fly  in  that  thing,’  Dad  said.  
A minute later, more strips of lamination started falling off.  
‘Richard,  I’m  afraid  we’re  going  to  have  to  abort  the  f light,’  Per  said.  ‘If  we  take  off,  we’ll  end  
up  in  the  Pacific.’  
I looked out at the crowded hillside. I was going to have to let them all down. With my hands 
trembling with cold and bitter disappointment, I once again picked up the microphone.  ‘I’m  so  sor ry,’  I  said,  trying  to  stop  my  voice  from  choking.  ‘The  lamination  of  the  balloon  has  
torn apart. We think that it was because we left the balloon out all last night and the frost got into it 
…’ 
As the translator repeated my words, a groan rose from the cr owd. Then there was a gasp and I 
looked up to see three or four huge chunks of fabric crash off the envelope and fall down on to the 
burners. Someone pulled them off, but the whole balloon was disintegrating in front of our eyes.  
‘Shut  off  the  burners!’  I   yelled.  ‘Stand  back  from  there.’  
Without the burners, the balloon sagged. It fell to one side, hot air seeping out of its holes.  
‘We’ll  come  back  next  year,’  I  promised.  ‘Please  have  faith  in  us.’  
‘Well,  Richard,’  said  Dad  as  we  all  drove  back  to  the  hotel ,  ‘holidays  with  you  are  never  dull.’  
Joan was two hours into her flight to Los Angeles when she heard the news.  
‘Excellent!’  she  exclaimed.  ‘Champagne  all  round,  please!’  
The pilot pulled back the throttle and the helicopter rose still higher. The pale -blue sea shimmered and 
glittered beneath us. I watched as we approached Necker: the white coral reef and then the pale strip 
of beach, the leaning palm trees and the pointed roof of the Bali house, the deep green of the forest 
inland. We circled overhead and  I saw our family and friends standing on the beach. Most of them 
were wearing white with wide -brimmed hats. There was a splash of colour from some tropical shirts. I 
spotted Vanessa and Robert; Lindi and her husband Robin; all the children; Peter and Ceri s, my 
friends and neighbours from Mill End; Ken and his wife Nancy; Simon and his wife Françoise. I 
waved down at their upturned faces. In the middle of the crowd I saw Joan in her stunning white dress, 
with Holly and Sam, her sister Rose, her brother John  and her mother beside her. Granny was standing 
with Mum and Dad, waving up at me merrily.  
I tapped the pilot on the shoulder and he brought the helicopter round once more.  
I picked up the box of Milk Tray and gripped it in my teeth. Everything was in plac e. I crouched 
low and paused at the open door. The wind was hot and fast in my face, the beach and silvery -blue sea 
spinning crazily beneath me, as I stared down. We were hovering over the swimming pool. I gripped 
the side of the door and looked back at th e pilot.  
‘All  because  the  lady  loves  Milk  Tray!’  he  shouted.  
I took the box out of my mouth for a moment.  
‘The  kids  do  too!’  I  shouted  back.  
I flashed him a thumbs up, took one last look at the swimming pool directly beneath me, and then 
climbed out on to the  struts  and  swung  off  them.  Joan  and  I  were  finally  getting  married  and  I  didn’t  
want the Milk Tray to melt. I prepared to jump.  20 ‘Who  the  hell  does  Richard  Branson  think  he  is?’  
August –October 1990  
I WAS WOKEN UP  by a heavy kick in my back. I had bee n thumped and prodded all night. Since it 
was now 5.30a.m., I slipped out of bed and put on my dressing gown. I watched Sam snuggle into my 
warm hollowed -out pillow, which he had been fighting to occupy all night. He and Holly still often 
slept in our bed with us. I turned on CNN and put my head close to the screen to hear the news. I 
didn’t  need  much  sound  to  understand  that  it  was  just  as  bad.  Iraq  had  invaded  Kuwait  the  previous  
week and the world was in a tailspin. The price of crude oil had soared from  $19 a barrel before the 
invasion to $36. The price of aviation fuel had rocketed from 75 cents a gallon to $1.50, an even 
sharper increase than the rise in crude oil because the Allied Forces had begun stockpiling aviation 
fuel in preparation for an airbo rne attack on Iraq.  
Two  of  the  main  ingredients  of  an  airline’s  profitability  are  the  number  of  passengers  and  the  cost  
of aviation fuel. All independent airlines were now facing disaster: we were having to operate when 
the price of fuel – which represents  20 per cent of our total overheads – had more than doubled, and 
the number of passengers flying had dried up. In the first week following the invasion, Virgin Atlantic 
received 3,000 cancellations. We had a £25 million overdraft facility with Lloyds Bank which we had 
just broken. I wondered how far we could go before Lloyds asked us to do something about it. I 
pushed the worry to the back of my mind.  
I wondered how many more passengers would cancel today. The big state -owned airlines were 
even worse hit si nce nobody wanted to risk flying on a flag -carrier due to the chance of a terrorist 
attack. Since Mrs Thatcher had allowed the American jets to refuel in Britain on their Libyan raid, 
companies that were closely aligned with the government were seen as vul nerable to terrorist 
retaliation. The bomb on the PanAm jumbo over Lockerbie had shown how devastating such 
retaliation could be. Despite being a normal public company, British Airways still proclaimed itself as 
the British flag -carrier, and for the first time this reputation was to our advantage. After the first week 
of empty flights, I was beginning to feel a glimmer of hope that passengers were cautiously returning: 
we had noticed a slight preference towards Virgin Atlantic in place of either any America n airline or 
British Airways.  
In the summer of 1990 Virgin Atlantic was still a tiny airline. We flew to just four destinations in 
two countries. Each day we scanned the bookings for these four routes to see whether there was any 
sign that we were winning passengers back. The Tokyo route was our worst hit. We were allowed to 
fly only four times a week – and never on Sunday, which is the most popular day for businessmen to 
travel – and so the route was losing money even before Iraq invaded Kuwait. Throughout  the summer 
we had been lobbying to be awarded the two extra flights to Tokyo which were about to be released, 
but as always we were up against British Airways. Our flights to Newark and Los Angeles had lost 
passengers from the first week after the invasio n, but now we detected a swing towards Virgin in 
preference to the American carriers. The best news was that our holiday flights to Miami and Orlando 
seemed to be largely unaffected.  
We had celebrated my fortieth birthday the previous month and, although Joan had arranged a 
wonderful party on Necker, I had found myself feeling uncharacteristically depressed. I felt that 
Simon had lost interest in Virgin Music, and I sympathised with hi m. It was extremely tough negotiating every contract and sometimes it felt rather repetitive going over the same points time and 
again. Although we had built Virgin Music into one of the major independent record labels, all 
Simon’s  wealth  was  tied  up  in  th at single company and I knew that he was worried I might jeopardise 
it  by  some  new  risky  venture.  Simon  wasn’t  interested  in  the  other  projects  I  talked  about  and  had  only  
ever seen Virgin Atlantic as a huge liability to the rest of the Virgin Group: a bus iness that could be 
driven to the wall by British Airways or by something out of the blue – something like a war in the 
Gulf. 
Turning forty had also made me wonder what I was doing with my life. After the great leap into 
setting up Virgin Atlantic, I now f ound that it was difficult to develop the airline as quickly as I 
wanted. Although we had had a wonderful year and had been voted Best Business Class Airline, 
Virgin Atlantic was confined to operating from Gatwick Airport. Due to a single short runway and the 
lack of connecting flights, Gatwick was less profitable, both for cargo and passengers, than Heathrow. 
We were struggling to make money. On top of this we had fallen into a maintenance dispute with 
British Airways which continued to be a large bone of contention.  
Given  Simon’s  gradual  loss  of  interest,  and  our  endless  struggles  to  make  ends  meet  at  Virgin  
Atlantic, I began to question whether I should start doing something completely different. I even 
thought of going to university and studying history: it would be  nice to have time to read. When I 
mentioned this to Joan she squashed the idea by bluntly pointing out that this was really just an excuse 
to meet a whole lot of pretty girls away from home. I mulled over the idea of setting up as a full -time 
political ca mpaigner. I thought of studying some of the major issues, such as healthcare and 
homelessness, understanding what the best solutions were, and then fighting hard for the political 
change to implement them.  
But all these thoughts were pushed out of my mind by  Saddam  Hussein’s  invasion  of  Kuwait.  We  
had the full -blown crisis at the airline, and I found myself caught up in the Gulf War in an 
extraordinarily personal way.  
‘Daddy,  please  can  you  help  me  find  my  shoes?’  
It was Holly.  
‘Which  ones?’  
‘You  know,  my  n ew  trainers.’  
As the world on the television continued to disintegrate towards war, and as our half -empty 747 
Maiden Voyager  headed across the Atlantic towards a dawn over Gatwick, my family gathered in bed 
for breakfast. Joan brought up a huge tray with f ried eggs, fried bread, bacon and baked beans. As we 
ate, some of the Virgin staff let themselves in through the front door. I heard Penni start up the 
photocopier downstairs. Our new press officer, Will Whitehorn, trooped upstairs to his office. A 
dynamo of perpetually cheerful energy, Will had already proved himself to be a terrific asset.  
Getting Holly and Sam ready for school was always a kind of mad initiative test. Shoes, socks, 
vests, shirts, blazers and berets had to be found wherever they had inexp licably hidden themselves 
overnight. They could be conjured up only by the most inspired lateral thinking.  ‘Here  they  are!’  Joan  had  somehow  thought  to  look  for  Holly’s  shoes  inside  the  large  doll’s  
house,  which  hadn’t  been  used  by  anyone  for  as  long  as  I   could remember.  
‘What  were  they  doing  there?’  I  asked.  
‘No  idea,’  Holly  said,  and  put  them  in  her  school  rucksack  without  further  explanation.  
‘Sam,  we’re  going  in   two minutes,’  Joan  threatened.  
Sam had started to reassemble the Scalextric.  
As they finally  managed to pick up all their bits and pieces and head for the door, the phone rang. 
It was Queen Noor of Jordan.  
My friendship with Queen Noor was one of the unlikely consequences of my balloon trip with 
Per across the Atlantic. Queen Noor was the Grace K elly of Jordan. She was American and had once 
worked as an air stewardess. Tall, blonde and wholly glamorous, she now lived in a walled and 
heavily guarded palace in Amman. Queen Noor had heard about our balloon flight and telephoned me 
to ask whether I wo uld teach her and her family how to fly a balloon. I had gone out to Jordan with 
Tom  Barrow  and  spent  a  week  at  King  Hussein’s  palace  teaching  the  royal  family  how  to  fly  a  hot -air 
balloon.  
We flew over Amman, hovering over the rooftops and looking down on  the ancient city with its 
minarets, whitewashed walls and faded orange -tiled rooftops. Nobody in Amman had ever seen a hot -
air balloon before, and they stared up in amazement as we loomed overhead. When they realised that 
their King and Queen were standin g in the wicker basket, they cheered and ran beneath the balloon 
waving up at us. When we fired the gas burner, all the dogs in the city started barking. With the 
barking, the cheering and the calls of the muezzins, the city gave in to total pandemonium. K ing 
Hussein, Queen Noor and the royal princes waved down as the balloon flew within three feet of the 
rooftops.  I  think  that  the  only  people  who  didn’t  enjoy  the  trip  were  King  Hussein’s  bodyguards,  who  
had successfully shielded him from nine assassination  attempts but who could do nothing to protect 
him as he floated around in a wicker basket.  
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, King Hussein of Jordan was one of the few world 
leaders who refused to condemn him out of hand. King Hussein pointed out that Kuw ait had promised 
Iraq a number of oil wells as part of its contribution towards the long war against Iran. Yet Kuwait had 
continually reneged on that promise and it had also cheated on its OPEC quotas.  
Among all the chaos which followed the invasion, a hug e number of foreign workers fled from 
Iraq into Jordan. There were around 150,000 refugees congregating in a makeshift camp with no water 
and no blankets. It was extremely hot during the day, when they had no shade; and freezing cold at 
night, when they ha d no warmth. A blanket can be rigged up as shade, and wrapped up in for warmth. 
As soon as I heard about this problem, I had contacted King Hussein and Queen Noor offering to do 
whatever I could to help. Queen Noor now telephoned me to say that, although t he Red Cross was in 
the process of setting up a water -distribution system, there was still the task of trying to find up to 
100,000 blankets.  ‘A  few  very  young  children  have  already  died,’  Queen  Noor  said,  ‘but  it  hasn’t  turned  into  a  full -
scale catastroph e  yet.  I  think  that  we’ve  only  got  about  two  or  three  days’  grace  before  we  start  to  lose  
hundreds  of  refugees.’  
That day I drove down to Crawley and talked to some of the Virgin Atlantic staff about how we 
would set about finding and then flying 100,000 b lankets to Amman. Everyone at Virgin rallied round. 
During the course of the day we called up the Red Cross, William Waldegrave at the Foreign Office 
and Lynda Chalker at the Overseas Development Office, and managed to secure 30,000 blankets, with 
the prom ise of more to come from UNICEF in Copenhagen. Now that we had offered to provide the 
plane, the Red Cross put out an appeal on national radio and from that evening a warehouse at 
Gatwick started filling up with blankets. On top of that, David Sainsbury pr omised me that he would 
supply several tons of rice.  
Two days later, all the seats were removed from one of our 747s and replaced by over 40,000 
blankets, several tons of rice and medical supplies. The 747 then flew to Amman. The blankets were 
loaded up in to a line of trucks waiting at the airport, and we came back with a number of British 
nationals who had been stranded in Jordan and wanted to come home.  
When I returned to Britain, William Waldegrave told me that he had had a call from Lord King, 
chairman of British Airways, who had been surprised to see the Virgin Atlantic flight to Jordan 
featuring on News at Ten . 
‘We  should  be  doing  that,’  Lord  King  had  told  Waldegrave.  
William Waldegrave had pointed out to Lord King that I had just offered to help and V irgin 
Atlantic happened to have an aircraft available to make it possible. The next week British Airways 
flew some supplies out to Jordan and brought back some more nationals. Christian Aid told us that 
they were amazed: over many years they had unsuccessf ully appealed to British Airways to help them, 
but, ever since the Virgin Atlantic flight to Amman, BA had been practically suffocating them with 
offers of help. Healthy competition even benefits charities sometimes.  
Since I heard that some of our original  shipment had not reached the refugee camps, I decided to 
go and stay in Amman for a few days to watch the procession of the next delivery of supplies until it 
finally reached the camps. Once again I stayed with King Hussein and Queen Noor at the palace. I  had 
fierce arguments with the minister for the interior about the need for strict accountability over these 
supplies so that the people who had provided them could be confident that they reached the camps. I 
also had several long talks with King Hussein a bout the Gulf crisis. King Hussein was sure that war 
could be averted, but was worried that the West wanted diplomacy to fail so that they could defend 
Kuwait and protect their oil supply. By the time I returned home it was clear that there would not be a 
full-blown refugee crisis in Jordan. Queen Noor told me that there were no more deaths from 
dysentery or dehydration. Over time the 150,000 refugees slowly dispersed.  
A few days later I was watching the news when I saw the extraordinary footage of Saddam 
Hussein surrounded by the British nationals who had been detained in Baghdad. In one of the most 
chilling scenes I have seen on television, he sat down and motioned a young boy to come and stand by 
him.  He  put  his  hand  on  this  young  boy’s  head,  and  then  con tinued to address the camera while gently 
patting his shoulder. The boy was about the same age as Sam. I knew that I had to do something to help these people. If that boy had been my son, I would have moved heaven and earth to bring him 
back home. The repo rters  were  expecting  that  the  hostages  would  be  used  as  ‘human  shields’  and  
would be incarcerated inside the prime Allied targets.  
I had no idea how I would set about helping bring these hostages home, but I knew that Virgin 
Atlantic had an aircraft and th at, if we could somehow obtain permission to fly into Baghdad, we 
would be able to pick up any hostages whom Saddam Hussein agreed to release. It struck me that, in 
the same way in which I had been able to help the crisis in Jordan, I might be able to prov ide the 
vehicle for releasing these hostages.  
The next day I was called by Frank Hessey. His sister Maureen and his brother -in-law Tony were 
hostages in Baghdad. Tony had severe lung cancer and needed urgent medical attention. He had 
telephoned every department in the Foreign Office, the Iraqi ambassa dors in Europe and even the Iraqi 
Government in Baghdad, but nobody seemed able to do anything. Frank asked me to help.  
As well as being in touch with the Foreign Office over the blankets -to-Jordan flight, I also had 
my friendship with King Hussein and Que en Noor. King Hussein was one of the few points of contact 
any government in the West had with Iraq. I had heard that Iraq was short of medical supplies and I 
wondered whether there were grounds for a deal whereby, if we flew in medical supplies, Iraq coul d 
release some foreign detainees. I called Queen Noor and asked her whether she could help me. When I 
described my proposal, she suggested that I come out to Amman once again and discuss it with King 
Hussein.  
The next three days, which I spent in Amman wit h King Hussein and Queen Noor, gave me an 
insight into how a businessman can help in moments of crisis. On the face of it, all I had to 
recommend me to Saddam Hussein was that I had once taken King Hussein and Queen Noor up in a 
hot-air balloon and I owned  a tiny airline that operated four Boeing 747s. Although nobody else had 
taken King Hussein hot -air ballooning, many businessmen own large aircraft. But these two 
qualifications had propelled me into a unique situation: I was one of the only Westerners who m King 
Hussein was prepared to confide in, and therefore I had virtually direct access to Saddam Hussein.  
I started to draft a letter to Saddam Hussein. I told him that I was staying in Amman, helping out 
with the repatriation of immigrants and organising some medical and food supplies. I asked him 
whether he would consider releasing any foreigners who were caught in Baghdad, particularly women 
and children and those who were sick. As a gesture of goodwill I offered to fly in some medical 
supplies that Iraq  was  short  of.  I  mentioned  Frank  Hessey’s  brother  and  his  lung  cancer.  I  signed  it  
‘Yours  respectfully,  Richard  Branson’.  
Then I went down to the drawing room and King Hussein spoke for an hour about the problems 
in the Middle East. As I sat there and list ened, I looked around and saw a signed photograph of 
Margaret Thatcher standing beside one of Saddam Hussein. King Hussein pointed out to me why he 
did not automatically support the Kuwaiti position against Iraq:  
‘The  people  of  Kuwait  are  divided  into  thre e  categories,’  he  said.’  There  are  400,000  Kuwaitis  
who are either very rich, or very, very rich; and there are 2 million impoverished immigrant workers 
looking  after  them.’  He pointed out that there was no free press and no free elections in Kuwait: it wa s hardly the 
democracy’  the  West  claimed  to  be  defending.  
‘The  Kuwaitis  do  nothing  for  the  Arab  world,’  he  went  on.  ‘All  their  money  is  in  Swiss  bank  
accounts,  not  in  Arabia.  I’ve  asked  a  number  of  world  leaders  whether  the  West  would  have  come  to  
Jordan’s rescue if Iraq had invaded Jordan, a country with no oil. Each time there was a silence. I 
doubt  it.’  Then  he  laughed.  ‘I  know  that  you  would,  though!  Yes,  you’d  come  sailing  over  the  horizon  
in your balloon with your Virgin planes beside you!  
‘No,  seriou sly,’  he  said,  ‘this  is  the  chance  to  resolve  the  entire  Middle  Eastern  question.  Kuwait  
promised Saddam Hussein that it would pay its share of the costs of the war against Iran, which Iraq 
fought on its behalf. It has reneged on that promise. Originally, Saddam only planned to take the 
disputed oilfields he thought were rightfully his. He only occupied the whole country because he heard 
that the Kuwaitis were preparing the landing strips to let the Americans come in and defend them. He 
is certainly not int erested  in  invading  Saudi  Arabia.’  
King  Hussein’s  peace  plan  involved  Iraq  pulling  back  to  the  border  but  keeping  the  disputed  strip  
of  land  which  he  felt  that  Kuwait  owed  Iraq.  Then  in  three  years’  time  there  should  be  elections  in  
Kuwait to see whether t hese border people wanted to be part of Kuwait or Iraq. He told me that the 
West had little idea of the months of negotiation which had gone on between Iraq and Kuwait, and 
how the Kuwaitis had continually failed to honour their promises. On top of that, t he Kuwaitis had not 
waived the debts which Iraq had incurred over the Iran war, and the Kuwaitis continued to cheat all 
the Arab states by overproducing oil and selling it too cheaply.  
At the end of dinner, King Hussein took my letter off to his study and translated it into Arabic. 
He wrote a covering letter to Saddam Hussein, and despatched it by special courier to Baghdad. 
Before  we  went  to  bed,  he  quoted  something  his  brother  had  said:  ‘Why  did  the  sheep  bells  of  the  
Falkland Islands ring louder than the  church  bells  of  Jerusalem?’  
Back in London, I began talking to the Foreign Office. I tried to get the medical details of all those 
people  stuck  in  Baghdad  so  that  we  could  ‘prove’  they  were  ill.  I  then  called  around  other  foreign  
embassies to alert them t hat there might be a rescue flight going into Baghdad and that they should try 
to  get  some  of  their  people  on  it  by  showing  ‘proof’  that  they  were  ill.  
Two nights after I returned to England, we got a response from Saddam Hussein. He promised us 
that he wo uld release the women and children and the sick hostages, but he wanted someone of stature 
to be flown in to ask him publicly to do so. I telephoned Edward Heath, the previous Conservative 
British prime minister, and asked him whether he would do so. He ag reed. King Hussein contacted 
Saddam  Hussein  and  put  forward  Ted  Heath’s  name.  Saddam  Hussein  agreed  to  him.  The  next  day  we  
flew Edward Heath out to Amman, where King Hussein arranged for him to go to Baghdad.  
A day later, King Hussein phoned me:  
‘I  have  good  news  for  you,  sir,’  he  said.  He  was  impeccably  polite  and  always  addressed  people  
as  ‘sir’  or  ‘madam’,  as  did  his  children.  ‘You  can  set  off  for  Baghdad.  I  have  Saddam’s  word  that  you  
will  be  safe.’  We had spent the last few days planning for this call  and had already found a brave volunteer 
crew,  whom  I’d  like  to  name:  Les  Millgate,  Geoff  New,  Paul  Green,  Ray  Maidment,  Peter  Johnson,  
Jane-Ann Riley, Sam Rasheed, Anita Sinclair, Caroline Spencer, Ralph Mutton, Peter Marnick, Paul 
Keithly, Helen Burn, Ni cola Collins, Janine Swift and Stephen Leitch. We had forewarned passengers 
that there might be delays on Virgin Atlantic and that we might have to move them on to another 
airline.  
When I told my fellow airline directors that we had permission to fly, they  were understandably 
concerned. They knew that if the plane was delayed in Baghdad for more than a handful of days we 
could go bust.  
‘The  government  has  confirmed  that  they  will  stand  behind  our  insurance  company  if  the  plane  is  
destroyed,’  Nigel  Primrose,  the  Virgin  Atlantic  finance  director,  confirmed.  ‘But  nobody  will  give  us  
loss-of-business insurance if the plane is hijacked and kept in Baghdad. Remember, BA have already 
had  one  747  wrecked  in  Kuwait.’  
There was silence round the table as they digested this.  
‘There  is  one  upside,’  David  Tait  said  with  a  serious  face.  ‘They’ll  hold  Richard  there  too  and  
spare  us  any  more  of  his  harebrained  schemes!’  
Everyone laughed.  
Although I knew I was risking everythi ng on this flight, I also knew by now that there was no 
backing out.  
We took off from Gatwick at 11a.m. on 23 October 1990 and headed east over Europe. We sat 
huddled together at the front of the plane, a strange collection of hostage relatives, doctors, n urses, 
Virgin cabin crew, and one journalist to represent the press. The remaining 400 seats behind us were 
empty. It was rather eerie. After a couple of hours we all walked up and down the aisles to get some 
exercise.  
The daylight outside rapidly faded an d by the time we entered Iraqi airspace it was dark. I looked 
out into the night and wondered where the Iraqi army was. I imagined the radar monitoring us as we 
headed towards Baghdad. We would be a single luminous green blob moving slowly across their dar k 
screens. I half expected to see a couple of fighter planes come up and give us an escort, but it 
remained unnervingly quiet. The plane hummed and shuddered its way towards Baghdad, the first 
plane in twelve months to do so. Everyone stopped talking. We w ere entering the most dangerous 
airspace  in  the  world,  the  concentrated  target  of  the  Allied  Forces’  planned  attack.  I  wondered  when  
the assault would begin.  
I let myself into the flight deck and sat behind the captain, Les Millgate, and the two first 
officers, Geoff New and Paul Green. They were talking to air -traffic control over the radio but that 
was the only sign that Baghdad was out there. Ahead of us through the windscreen there was nothing. 
Iraq had a complete blackout. I wondered who lived down the re, whether they could hear us flying 
overhead and whether they thought that we were the first Allied bomber. We seemed to be the only 
plane in the sky.  ‘We’re  getting  close  to  the  city,’  Les  Millgate  said.  
I scanned the screens in front of us and watched the altimeters drop as we descended. Flying long 
haul is deceptive. For most of the time up in the air you are above the cloud level in that magical 
world of the jet stream, hardly aware that you are moving. Then, as the plane starts coming down, you 
sudde nly realise that you are flying a massive piece of metal at over 400 miles an hour and it has to be 
brought to a standstill. We came down lower and the plane hurtled through the darkness. Normally an 
airport is a blaze of orange and silver lights and it is  difficult to distinguish the runway lights among 
them. The runways, ramps, planes and control tower are all brilliant with fluorescent and halogen 
lighting. But, for the first time, we were flying over a land that was so blacked out we could have been 
flying over the sea.  
Geoff New was being guided in by air -traffic control at Baghdad. He opened the wing flaps and 
let down the undercarriage. I watched as we came lower and lower. Now we were only 600 feet up, 
now 500 feet. The disembodied voice of the air -traffic controller started counting out our height. 
Suddenly, two lines of landing lights lit up in the darkness below us. We aimed straight down the 
middle; the plane touched down and raced along the tarmac. A few more lights appeared to guide us, 
and we t axied to the loading gates. I could dimly make out men with machine guns standing alongside 
a flight of steps. Jane -Ann Riley, our in -flight supervisor, signalled the door was safe to be opened, 
and I looked out. It was freezing cold.  
The steps were being manoeuvred towards us. I led the way down to Iraqi tarmac. Two lines of 
soldiers fanned out around us. A couple of senior government officials wearing brown camel -hair 
overcoats greeted us and indicated that the relatives should stay aboard. Baghdad airpor t is bigger than 
Heathrow but it was completely deserted: ours was the only aircraft there. I looked back at the 
incongruous sight of the Virgin cabin crew, with their red miniskirts and red stilettos, walking past the 
group of Iraqi soldiers in the vast e mpty airport. Their heels clacked loudly in the silence. We all 
smiled. The soldiers were a little timid at first, but then grinned back. Without any other planes on the 
runway, ours looked unnaturally large.  
We were taken into a bare departure lounge where all the technology – computer terminals, 
telephones and even light fittings – had been stripped out. This would have taken some time, and it 
indicated that the Iraqis were fully expecting to be bombed and ha d already salvaged everything they 
wanted  from  the  airport.  We  handed  out  some  presents  we’d  brought:  boxes  of  chocolates  for  the  
officers  and  lots  of  Virgin  kids’  flightpacks  for  the  soldiers  to  send  home  to  their  families.  Then  I  
heard movement outside a nd Ted Heath came through the glass doors at the head of a large crowd of 
men, women and children. They looked pale under the fluorescent lights. As soon as they saw us they 
broke into a cheer and ran forward to embrace us. Ted was smiling and laughing and  clasping 
everybody by the hand.  
I  soon  realised  that  we  weren’t  going  to  take  all  these  people  back  with  us.  Everyone  was  
laughing and hugging each other, tears streaming down their faces. Outside, the soldiers were 
unloading the medical supplies we had b rought. We opened bottles of champagne and toasted each 
other  and  those  that  were  to  be  left  behind.  I  found  Frank  Hessey’s  brother  and  we  hugged.  A  pregnant  
Filipino woman who was having to leave her husband behind came up to me. She was in tears. 
Another  man had to hand his three -year-old daughter to his nanny and say goodbye to her. I just 
hugged him. There was nothing else I could do. We both had tears in our eyes. I was a father too.  After an hour the Iraqis told us to get back on the plane. As we walk ed across the freezing tarmac 
I  shook  hands  with  the  soldiers  and  gave  them  more  children’s  packs  for  their  kids.  We  wished  each  
other well. It was disturbing to think that when we flew away these frail -looking, scared soldiers in 
their uncomfortable boots  and olive -green trousers would still be clutching their guns and keeping 
guard at what would probably be the first target to be bombed to smithereens.  
Most of the hostages walked arm in arm across the runway to keep warm and support each other. 
They looke d like ghosts. The lone 747 dwarfed them. All the lights had once again been turned off, 
apart from a single spotlight illuminating the steps. I went up the stairs and turned to wave goodbye.  
‘You’re  always  late!’  said  a  gruff  voice.  It  was  Frank  Hessey.  H e had stayed on board to surprise 
his sister and brother -in-law. When they saw each other they burst into tears and hugged.  
My last sight of the Iraqi soldiers was of them gathering together and starting to pull open the red 
Virgin packs we had given them.  We may well have been the first Westerners they had ever met. They 
knew that the second lot would soon arrive, roaring overhead and firing missiles. Will Whitehorn had 
been checking through all the bags the hostages had brought with them. At the last minu te he found a 
bag with a transistor radio which nobody claimed. Just as the plane door was about to be closed he ran 
towards it and threw the bag down on to the concrete. The soldiers were too startled to do anything. 
The bag lay there as the doors shut an d the plane rolled back off the blocks.  
Inside the plane there was a great cheer as the relatives swarmed down the aisles to hug each 
other. We put on seat belts for takeoff, but as soon as the plane levelled out the party started. We had 
got away. We were  standing around with glasses of champagne and swapping stories when the pilot 
announced that we had left Iraqi airspace. There was applause.  
I  grabbed  the  microphone  and  pulled  Ted  Heath’s  leg  by  announcing,  ‘And  I’ve  just  had  word  
that Mrs Thatcher is absolutely  delighted  that  Ted  has  managed  to  return  safely!’  Her   bête noire  was 
on the way home.  
Frank Hessey, his sister Maureen and brother -in-law Tony held hands in a state of disbelief: they 
couldn’t  believe  that  they  were  together  and  had  left  Baghdad.   Others on the plane were crying – they 
were delighted to be free but in turmoil over those they had left behind. Two months later Tony was to 
die of lung cancer, and Baghdad airport was reduced to rubble by the heaviest concentration of 
firepower ever used  by a military force. I hope that the Iraqi soldiers with their badly cut uniforms had 
somehow managed to escape.   
  
‘Who  the  hell  does  Richard  Branson  think  he  is?’  Lord  King  demanded  of  William  Waldegrave  
in  his  second  call  to  him.  ‘Part  of  the  bloody  Foreign  Office?’  
Lord  King’s  indignation  was  echoed  by  some  newspapers,  who  suggested  I  was  doing  it  only  for  
personal glory. Stung by this criticism, while st aying with King Hussein I tried to analyse my motives 
in my diary:  
  
Feel absolutely shattered. Been burning the candle at both ends. During an interview with ITN 
about the various people I saw, I choked up. Telling the story of the British father who had to 
hand his three -year-old child to a nanny at Baghdad airport to tak e her out of the country, and the 
woman from the Philippines who had that day left the country to have her second baby. I could 
only get halfway through telling it.  
What are the motives for doing things? Is there any truth in the jibes? One month ago I was  
doing an interview with Vanity Fair  and was at an all -time  low.  I’d  seemed  to  have  run  out  of  a  
purpose  in  my  life.  I’d  proved  myself  to  myself  in  many  areas.  I’d  just  turned  forty.  I  was  seeking  
a new challenge. I was even considering selling up everythi ng except for the airline. Getting 
smaller. Being able to focus on one business venture that I loved. But also to have the time to try 
to use my business skills to tackle issues that I felt I could help, such as in attacking the cigarette 
companies, cervic al cancer, etc.  
I  felt  I’d  get  better  self -satisfaction in this way and would not be wasting the next forty years 
of my life just running companies, getting bigger – a repeat of the first forty years.  
Do  I  need  recognition  for  this?  No,  I  don’t  think  so.  T he dilemma is that to campaign on 
many issues you need to use yourself publicly to get people moving. Television is a very 
powerful medium. By my speaking on TV, the tons of medicine, the foodstuffs and blankets and 
tents reached the refugees. The £2 milli on  from  Mrs  Thatcher’s  government  has  come  through.  
An emergency meeting has taken place between the five main charities. Free advertising is to 
start on the BBC and ITV. I believe that by moving quickly a major disaster in this case has been 
averted. But,  by not speaking out, it would not have been.  
The dilemma is how often one can use the press in this way in one small country like 
England  without  losing  one’s  appeal  to  the  public.  If  there  should  be  a  hint  that  I’m  doing  it  for  
personal glory, then I won ’t  be  able  to  do  it  at  all.  
By  flying  into  Baghdad  and  rescuing  the  hostages  Virgin  had  again  usurped  British  Airways’  
traditional role. At the time I had no idea that the Virgin flight into Baghdad would annoy Lord King 
so much. I was trying to help out – I had an aeroplane at my disposal and I could act quickly. 
Although this plane was one of just four planes Virgin Atlantic operated, suddenly we looked like a 
much larger airline. We had successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein; we had carried in medic al 
supplies;;  and  we  had  brought  back  the  hostages.  I  only  found  out  later  that  Lord  King’s  indignant  
reaction was the start of an entire campaign by British Airways to try to put Virgin Atlantic out of 
business.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 21 ‘We  would  have  about  two  seconds  to  say  o ur  last  prayers.’  
November 1990 –January 1991  
EVER SINCE WE HAD  abandoned our attempt the previous December, Per had been building the 
new envelope for the balloon that would attempt to take us across the Pacific Ocean. By the beginning 
of December it had b een shipped out to Miyakonojo to join the capsule and await a good jet stream 
overhead.  
A Japanese balloonist, Fumio Niwa, was challenging us to be the first to cross the Pacific, and 
was planning to fly a helium balloon. Per and I and our families and the  balloon team arrived in 
Miyakonojo, and Fumio and I talked and joked over the radio as the preparation went on. He too was 
grounded by the unseasonably slow jet stream, which our weather -forecasting charts implied would 
leave us stranded somewhere over th e Pacific. We waited and practised safety drills. We also watched 
the mounting tension in the Gulf on CNN. We felt sure that the Allied attack would take place just 
after Christmas. Per and I agreed that, if the Allied Forces declared war on Iraq, we would  cancel the 
trip for a second time and return home.  
As we approached Christmas there was still no war in the Gulf but there was also no sign of a 
sufficiently strong jet stream to take us across the Pacific. Bob Rice told us it was likely to be at least a 
week before an improvement. Per flew back to England  for Christmas. Joan and I took our family 
down to Ishigaki, an island off the south Japanese coast.  
The island was very quiet and had the classic Japanese landscape of mountains and sea. I spent 
time with my mother and father, and we watched the cormorant  fishermen in their canoes. These 
fishermen were carrying out a tradition dating back several thousand years. They lined up six or seven 
birds along the edge of the boat and one by one the cormorants went diving for fish. The birds then 
brought them back t o the boat and opened their beaks for the fishermen to remove the fish. The birds 
had rings round their necks to stop them swallowing.  
I would have loved to have spoken to these fishermen. Probably they were as stressed about their 
money and families as an yone else, but their life seemed so tranquil and rooted in such an ancient 
tradition that I felt they must have come to terms with time in a way I never had. I wondered how they 
would have viewed my constant rushing about, my wish to set up new companies, to challenge 
myself, and to fly over the Pacific at 30,000 feet in a hot -air balloon.  
At the end of our holiday, Joan took the children back to London to start school. Joan does not – 
understandably – like the idea of my ballooning and likes even less the idea of seeing me take off. I 
hugged  them  all  farewell  at  Tokyo’s  Narita  Airport  and  then  braced  myself  for  the  trip.  As  my  parents  
and I walked through the airport to catch an internal flight to Miyakonojo I saw a television screen. In 
wildly flickering f ootage the news showed a helicopter hovering over the sea and winching a body on 
board. From the respectful tone of the reporter, I immediately knew that it was Fumio, and that he was 
dead. 
We had all been on such a high, but this put our lives and the ris ks I was taking with them into 
perspective: it could have been us. We found somebody who could speak a little English. They 
explained that Fumio had taken off the previous morning but had crashed into the sea just off the coast. He had radioed for help fro m his capsule but he was dead by the time the rescue helicopter 
arrived. He had died of exposure.  
The  sight  of  Fumio’s  body  being  winched  out  of  the  freezing  ocean  killed  off  much  of  my  
enthusiasm for the flight. I felt a deep sense of foreboding, but was equally helpless to withdraw. If the 
weather conditions were right, we would climb into the capsule and take off. I resigned myself to fate, 
and forced myself to make the best of it.  
Later we found out exactly what had happened to Fumio. He had taken off t he day before we 
were due back, hoping to steal a march on us. The strong winds had torn the envelope of his balloon, 
forcing him to ditch in the Pacific in his capsule. But the ocean was so rough that when the seaplane 
arrived it was unable to pick him up  and had radioed for a helicopter. There was a delay while the 
rescue  services  sorted  out  which  helicopter  should  come.  By  the  time  it  arrived  Fumio  was  dead.  He’d  
been only about 10 miles into the 8,000 -mile journey. It was a salutary warning.  
Per and I p lanned to launch the balloon on Sunday 13 January. The Allied Forces had given 
Saddam Hussein a deadline of 15 January by which to leave Kuwait, and we felt sure that the attack 
would take place very soon after that deadline. Unfortunately it was too windy  for us to inflate the 
balloon on Sunday and we postponed it until Monday. The jet stream now picked up speed, and by 
Monday 14 January it looked as if the flight might be possible. In the evening the weather cleared and 
we started inflating the balloon.  
After taking a sleeping pill that afternoon, Per and I were woken at 2.30a.m. to go down to the 
launch site. We made our way through the thousands of people who had come to watch despite the 
cold. We walked behind a police car which slowly inched along. The  Japanese children held up 
candles  and  waved  Union  Jacks  at  us.  They  sang  ‘God  Save  The  Queen’  in  perfect  English  accents.  
Once again people had set up braziers and were barbecuing fish and sweetcorn.  
‘Don’t  eat  anything,’  I  warned  Per  as  he  was  about  to  a ccept  some  fish.  ‘The  last  thing  I  need  is  
you  having  a  bout  of  food  poisoning  up  there.’  
In front of us, absorbing all the attention, the balloon was straining at its steel hawsers. It towered 
over everyone. This time it was large enough to swallow the do me  of  St  Paul’s  cathedral.  It  had  been  
heated to a great temperature, and was ready to soar upward as soon as the cables were cut.  
We thanked the people of Miyakonojo for their hospitality and released some white doves as a 
rather futile peace gesture. Jus t before I climbed up the steps into the capsule, I sent someone to fetch 
my parents. Everyone was now very edgy, looking up at the straining balloon as it tried to rise. My 
parents made their way through the barriers and police and we just hugged each oth er. My mother 
gave me a letter which I zipped into a trouser pocket.  
‘Time  to  go!’  Per  yelled.  
As we turned we saw Alex, our designer and engineer, emerge from the capsule with the biggest 
adjustable  spanner  we’d  ever  seen.  ‘I  think  it’ll  be  OK  now,’  he  sa id. 
We climbed up the steps and ducked down into the capsule.  As the ground crew backed away, we started firing the burners. The pressure to lift grew stronger 
and stronger, and then Per fired the bolts which released the steel hawsers and we rocketed upwa rd. 
For the first few breathless minutes we just marvelled at our silent speed. Then the balloon rose above 
the dark covering of cloud and we saw the silver dawn on the horizon. I got on to the radio and made 
contact with the ground crew.  
‘You’re  up  and  aw ay!’  Will  Whitehorn  shouted.  ‘The  crowd  down  here  are  cheering  like  crazy.  It  
looks  amazing.  You’re  heading  up  fast.’  
Within five minutes we were out of sight of Miyakonojo and heading up into the jet stream. 
Within half an hour we were well over the Pacif ic Ocean. Then at 23,000 feet we hit the bottom of the 
jet stream. It was as if we had struck a glass ceiling. However much we burnt, the balloon refused to 
go in. The winds were too strong, and they were pushing down the flat dome of the balloon. We kept 
pushing up against it, and we kept being buffeted back down. We put on our parachutes and clipped 
ourselves to the life rafts in case the balloon suffered a catastrophic rip. Then, at last, the balloon 
edged into the jet stream.  
The top of the balloon took  off ahead of us, and I saw it streaming in front of and even below the 
capsule. We were knocked to one side. From travelling at 20 knots we were suddenly flying at 100 
knots. For a moment I thought we were going to be torn apart, and I remembered my image  of the 
thousand horses dragging us to pieces, but then the capsule came into the jet alongside the balloon and 
we  were  righted.  The  balloon  rose  above  us  again  and  we  were  safely  tucked  into  the  jet.  Per’s  relief  
didn’t  give  me  the  greatest  of  confidence:  
‘Nobody’s  done  that  before,’  he  said.  ‘We’re  in  uncharted  territory.’  
After seven hours it was time to dump an empty fuel tank. We had six tanks of propane bolted to 
the capsule. The idea was that we would change the fuel tank when one was empty, jettison  the dead 
weight, and fly correspondingly faster. We decided to go down out of the jet stream as we dropped the 
tank in case anything went wrong.  
We had a video camera beneath the capsule which pointed vertically downward – in effect an 
extra window for us . The sea below us looked dangerous: it was running to great waves, and although 
we were 25,000 feet above it we could clearly see the white tops and the deep shadows of the troughs.  
I looked at the video monitor as Per pressed the button to release the em pty fuel tank. Before I 
could see what happened, the capsule lurched sideways. I was thrown across the capsule and landed 
on top of Per.  
‘What’s  happened?’  I  cried.  
‘No  bloody  idea.’  
I crawled back up the sloping floor of the capsule to my seat. We were su spended at an angle of 
about 25 degrees above the horizontal. Per checked all the controls to see if he could see what had 
gone wrong. We had no idea if we were hanging by just one steel rope and the capsule was about to 
part company with the balloon and p lummet down into the sea. I reran the video and watched what happened when the fuel tanks fell away. To my horror I saw three tanks falling down to the sea rather 
than one.  
‘Per,  look  at  this.’  
We watched again in silence.  
‘Bloody  hell!’  Per  said.  ‘All  the  tanks  on  one  side  of  the  capsule  have  gone.’  
Rather than jettisoning one empty tank, we had actually jettisoned one empty tank and two full 
ones. The implications of this were horrific. We had flown only around 1,000 miles and now we had 
just half the fuel we had started out with. We had three tanks of propane rather than five to fly us 
across the most dangerous and remote part of the Pacific Ocean.  
‘Watch  out!’  Per  said.  ‘We’re  rising.’  
I looked at the altimeter. Without the weight of the two full tanks of fuel, the balloon was soaring 
upward. We wer e once again buffeted as we entered the jet stream, but we hit it with such speed that 
we carried on rising. The altimeter ticked steadily upward from 31,000 feet to 34,000 feet.  
‘I’m  letting  air  out,’  Per  said.  ‘We’ve  got  to  come  down.’  
I stared at the al timeter, willing it to slow down: 35,000, 36,000, 37,000, 38,000 feet. We had no 
idea how strong the capsule was. We knew that the glass dome was able to withstand pressure of only 
around 42,000 feet, and even that was something of a guess. If we reached 4 3,000 feet the glass dome 
would explode. We would have about two seconds in which to say our last prayers, long enough to see 
our lungs being sucked out of our chests. After that our eyeballs would pop out of their sockets. We 
would become a scattering of debris somewhere in the Pacific.  
Per had opened the vent at the top of the balloon, but it was still rising. The weight of the three 
fuel  tanks  we  had  dropped  and  the  amount  of  hot  air  we’d  needed  to  support  them  was  the  problem.  It  
was a race between time  and the altimeter. Thank goodness we had gone down out of the jet stream 
before we had dropped the fuel tanks.  
‘It’s  slowing,’  I  said  with  helpless  optimism.  ‘I’m  sure  it’s  slowing.’  
The altimeter ticked up: 39,000, 39,500, 40,000, 40,500, 41,000 feet.  
We were now in the realm of the unknown. None of our equipment had been tested at this kind of 
height and anything could go wrong.  
At 42,500 feet the altimeter finally stopped rising. I wondered bleakly whether this was because 
it had broken and simply could  not register any greater height. We were way above the heights flown 
by all passenger jets except Concorde. But then it clicked down 500 feet. And then some more.  
‘We  don’t  want  to  come  down  too  fast,’  Per  said.  ‘We’ll  only  have  to  burn  fuel  to  bring  us  b ack 
up  again.’ He shut the vent and the balloon continued to fall, down to 35,000 feet. Then we had to start 
firing the burners again to stay in the jet stream.  
At last we could confront the problem of the lost fuel tanks. Our radio contact with the San Jo sé 
flight centre remained good, and they were clearly as devastated by the loss of the tanks as we were. 
There were some rapid calculations. If we were to reach land in the time available to us before the fuel 
ran out, we had to fly at an average speed of 170 miles an hour, twice as fast as any hot -air balloon 
had ever flown before. The odds against us were overelming.  
‘What  about  Hawaii?’  I  asked.  ‘Can  we  aim  to  land  nearby?’  
‘It’s  a  needle  in  a  haystack,’  Per  said.  ‘We’ll  never  get  anywhere  near  it.’  
‘I  wonder  if  America  is  doable,’  I  whispered.  
‘Of  course  it’s  doable,’  he  said.  ‘The  question  is  whether  we  can  do  it.’  
Per’s  a  precise  logician  when  he  wants  to  be.  
I asked over the radio about the conditions below us. Mike Kendrick, the project manager, came  
on loud and agitated:  
‘I’ve  just  spoken  to  a  cargo  ship  which  is  in  the  area.  They  said  there’s  a  strong  wind  and  high  
seas.  “Atrocious”  is  the  word  he  used.’  
Per  leant  over  and  urbanely  asked  Mike,  ‘What  do  you  mean  by  “atrocious”?  Over.’  
‘I  mean  fucking  atrocious .  You’re  not  going  to  ditch  in  there.  No  boat  will  turn  round  to  pick  you  
up. There are waves over 50 feet high. The nearest boat says that the seas are running so high their 
boat would be bust in half if it tried to turn. Do you understand? Over .’ 
‘Keep  going  on  your  current  altitude,’  Bob  Rice  came  on.  ‘The  jet  is  reasonably  strong.’  
Then, all of a sudden, the radio cut out.  
For the next six hours we had no contact with the outside world. Due to the terrible weather 
around us we were in a high -frequency blackout spot. We were somewhere over the Pacific, hanging 
by a few steel hawsers to a vast balloon, the remaining fuel tanks dangling off the side of the capsule 
like a necklace, and we could not make any contact with anybody. We could barely con trol where we 
were going or how fast we were getting there, and we hardly dared move around the capsule. Our 
three main points of reference were the Global Positioning System, our watches and the altimeter. 
Every ten or fifteen minutes we took a reading of f the GPS and calculated our groundspeed.  
As we flew on Per began to show signs of utter exhaustion.  
‘I’m  just  going  to  have  a  rest,’  he  mumbled,  and  lay  down  on  the  floor.  
I was alone. Unlike during the Atlantic crossing, when I had been more of a passeng er than a 
pilot, I now really understood what was happening. If we were going to make land, our only chance was to keep the balloon absolutely in the centre of the jet stream. The vein of wind there is only a 
hundred metres wide, just four times the width of the balloon itself. But staying in it was our only 
hope. 
The sky was pitch -black all around us. I scarcely looked out of the capsule and tried to 
concentrate on the instruments. As I sat there, with Per lying comatose on the floor, it seemed clear 
that we were both going to die. With just three fuel tanks we would run out of fuel some thousand 
miles off the American coast and have to ditch in the sea. It could well be night -time; Mike had told us 
the ground weather was atrocious – fucking atrocious – and nobody would be able to find us. We 
would have to fly this balloon for another thirty hours if we were going to live. I knew that the only 
chance of our living was for me to fly the balloon right in the core of the jet stream. I put all thoughts 
of death out of my head, and for the next ten hours concentrated intently on the dials.  
I do not believe in God but, as I sat there in the damaged capsule, hopelessly vulnerable to the 
slightest shift in weather or mechanical fault, I could not believe my eyes. It was as if a spirit had 
entered the capsule and was helping us along. As I watch ed the instruments and calculated our 
groundspeed, it became clear that we were beginning to fly very fast, close to the necessary 170 miles 
an hour. Before we had dropped the fuel tanks we had been flying at about 80 miles an hour, which 
had been very goo d progress. This was a miracle.  
I  slapped  myself  across  the  face  to  make  sure  I  wasn’t  hallucinating,  but  each  fifteen  minutes  the  
speeds grew faster: 160 miles an hour, 180, 200, and even 240. This was astounding. I tried not to 
imagine the size of the ba lloon above me: I just looked at the dials and pretended that I was driving 
some kind of weightless car which I had to keep within a ribbon of road. Whenever we dropped speed, 
I assumed that we had dropped out of the inner core of the jet stream and so I b urnt a little gas – as 
little as possible – and generally we picked up speed again.  
Even at this amazing speed, it still takes an hour to fly 200 miles and we had 6,000 of them to fly. 
I tried not to be daunted by the length of the journey ahead, but conce ntrated on each fifteen -minute 
section. I was desperately trying not to fall asleep. My head kept dropping forward and I pinched 
myself to keep awake. I suddenly saw an eerie light on the glass dome above us. I looked up and 
marvelled at it: it was white a nd orange and flickering. Then I yelled: it was fire. I squinted at it and 
realised that burning white lumps of propane were tumbling all around the glass dome, just missing it.  
‘Per!’  I  yelled.  ‘We’re  on  fire.’  
Per lurched awake and looked up. He has incr edibly quick reactions, and in spite of his 
exhaustion it took him a split second to decide what to do:  
‘Take  her  up,’  he  said.  ‘We’ve  got  to  get  up  to  40,000  feet  where  there’s  no  oxygen.  Then  the  
fire’ll  go  out.’  
I fired the burners and the balloon began  to rise. It seemed to rise too slowly, and the lumps of 
propane continued to drop all around the glass dome. With the outside temperature at minus 70 
degrees and the heat of the fireballs, it would take only one hitting the glass to explode it.  
We rose th rough 36,000 feet, 38,000 feet, and put on our oxygen masks. They were scant 
comfort. If the glass dome cracked or melted, we would die within seconds from loss of air pressure. We were caught in a catch -22: the lack of oxygen at 40,000 feet would snuff ou t the flames on the 
glass dome but it could also snuff out the burners. If the burners went out before the propane fireballs, 
we’d  drift  back  down  to  36,000  feet  before  we  could  restart  the  burners  and  the  propane  fire  would  
continue to threaten the glass.  
We rose to 43,000 feet. At last the burners spluttered and the fire was snuffed out. Per opened the 
vent at the top of the balloon and we headed back down. As well as risking the capsule exploding at 
43,000 feet, we had wasted precious fuel.  
We flew on wi thout radio communication for another hour. I kept myself going by talking into 
the video camera. I imagined that I was talking to Joan, Holly and Sam, and kept chatting away, 
telling them how much I loved them and that we were coming back to land in Ameri ca. The balloon 
stayed at 29,000 feet, and continued to sweep northeastward towards the West Coast of America. We 
were in a tiny metal capsule swinging around in the stratosphere above a dark ocean. I was too 
frightened to eat anything other than apples an d some chocolate. I wrote in my logbook:  
  
Flown seventeen hours and four minutes. Feels like a lifetime. Coming near the dateline. When 
we cross the dateline we beat our world hot -air-ballooning record. However, right now we are 
about as far away from hel p as anyone could ever be, sitting in a tilting capsule with half our fuel 
gone, terrified that if we move the rest will fall off. Not sure whether war has broken out because 
we have lost all communication with the outside world. Unlikely to reach the coas t. But spirits up 
and  the  speed  we’re  going  is  amazing.  
As  our  hours  out  of  contact  with  San  José  continued,  I  wrote,  ‘Things  look  pretty  desperate.  I’m  
not  certain  at  this  moment  that  we’ll  get  home.’  
Then, just as abruptly as we had lost contact, we made  it. I heard voices on the radio. By this time 
radio  contact  had  been  down  for  six  hours  and  ten  minutes.  Mike  had  thought  he’d  lost  us  as  two  of  
the ships he had steaming towards us had reported sighting wreckage.  
‘Mike,  is  that  you?’  
‘Richard!  Where  are   you?’ 
‘Sitting  in  a  tin  can  over  the  Pacific.’  
We nearly wept with relief.  
‘We  thought  that  you  must  have  ditched.  God,  we  practically  mobilised  the  airforce  and  the  
navy.’ 
‘We’re  OK,’  I  lied.  ‘We’ve  had  a  fire  up  on  the  capsule  from  propane  but  it’s  gone  out.’  
I gave them our position.  
‘Any  other  problems,  apart  from  not  having  enough  fuel  to  go  home?’  Mike  wanted  to  know.  ‘No.  We’re  still  tilting.  We’re  certainly  not  going   to  fire  off  any  more  fuel  tanks.’  
‘War’s  broken  out  in  the  Gulf,’  a  girl’s  voice  said.  It  was  Penni,  who  was  in  the  control  room  
with  them.  ‘The  Americans  are  bombing  Baghdad.’  
I thought of the soldiers I had met at Baghdad airport. The outbreak of the Gul f War meant that, 
if we did have to ditch, quite rightly we would be the last priority for anyone.  
‘Thank  God  we’ve  got  hold  of  you,’  Bob  Rice  said.  ‘I’ve  worked  out  your  route.  You  need  to  
come down immediately. Your current jet stream will soon start ben ding  back  towards  Japan.  You’ll  
be marooned over the Pacific. If you come down from 30,000 feet to 18,000 feet you might get the jet 
that’s  heading  north.  It’s  sweeping  up  towards  the  Arctic  but  at  least  it’s  land.’  
‘Christ!’  Mike  swore.  ‘Another  half  an  h our  and  you’d  have  been  swinging  back  away  from  us.’  
We cut off the burners and began to descend. After five hours Bob told us to rise again. We went 
back up to 30,000 feet and sure enough found ourselves heading northwest. We now flew steadily 
hour after hour. We stayed in the jet stream and kept the fuel we burnt to a minimum. We were still 
over the Pacific, flying at 200 miles an hour in a lopsided capsule, and we were exhausted, but now we 
had radio contact I felt that anything was possible. And the mir acle continued. Our speeds were 
extraordinary: 210 miles an hour, 220, 200. We were just beating the average 180 miles an hour we 
needed. Someone was being very kind to us.  
The good news was that we were now heading steadily towards the Canadian coastline. The fuel 
was lasting well; our speeds kept up; and Per and I began to believe that we might even make land. I 
was still too frightened to doze off since the only few second s I had fallen asleep I had terrifying 
nightmares of skulls and death. We were both exhausted, dehydrated and fighting to keep our 
concentration.  
‘You’re  heading  way  north,’  Mike  Kendrick  told  us.  ‘The  rescue  team  is  chasing  you  to  try  to  get  
to  where  you’ re  going  to  land.  They’re  in  a  Learjet.  Will’s  there,  and  so  are  your  parents.’  
After 36 hours of flying, we finally crossed the coast of northern Canada. It was too dark to see, 
but we felt safer. Even though we were now heading for the Rockies, one of th e most inhospitable 
mountain ranges you could find, at least it was land. We hugged each other and shared a chocolate 
bar. It was an incredible feeling. As we started flying over the Rockies, we made radio contact with 
the local ground control, Watson Lake  Flight Service.  
‘Put  your  rescue  beacon  on,’  they  advised.  ‘You’re  heading  into  a  blizzard.  There’s  zero  visibility  
and  a  wind  of  35  knots.  The  Learjet  has  turned  back  to  shelter  at  Yellowknife.’  
Our exhilaration turned to despair. We put on the rescue be acon, and from then on every five 
seconds there was an ear -splitting beep. We had been expecting to land in California with an escort of 
helicopters but we had missed Los Angeles by 3,000 miles and were heading into an Arctic blizzard. 
We knew we could lan d safely and then die, just as easily as Fumio had done. Hot -air balloons are 
fragile things: they are not designed to be flown in blizzards. A bad blizzard could tear up the balloon 
and we could drop out of the sky. It was just before dawn.  We knew we had  to land soon after dawn. If we left it for another two or three hours the sun 
would  heat  up  the  balloon’s  envelope  and  we  would  continue  to  fly  past  Greenland,  deeper  into  the  
Arctic and out of reach of any rescue team.  
One of my allotted jobs was to prep are the balloon for landing. When we were at 750 feet, I 
opened the hatch. Cold air and snow rushed in. I climbed out on to the top of the capsule. We were in 
the middle of a snowstorm, and whirling along at around 80 miles an hour. It was difficult to kee p my 
balance as we were still hanging at an angle and the top of the metal capsule was frozen. I held on to 
the steel hawsers and leant across to remove the safety pins which are there to prevent the bolts from 
firing if we hit a lightning storm. I pulled them out and threw them into the snowstorm. I crouched 
there for a minute and watched the snow whirl around me.  
The only light was the huge orange flame above me. Snowflakes were spinning around me and 
falling into the flame, where they vanished. One of th e most magical things about ballooning is that 
you do not hear the wind because you are travelling at the same speed as it is. You can be flying at 
150 miles an hour and put tissue paper on the capsule which – in theory – shouldn’t  blow  off.  And  so,  
althou gh we were in the middle of a snowstorm, it was very quiet. I was mesmerised by the sight of 
the snowflakes vanishing into the flames. Then I peered around and began to see the ground below us. 
I realised that one of the reasons why it was so dark was that  we were flying over a thick pine forest. I 
shouted down to Per:  
‘Don’t  get  too  low.  It’s  all  forest.  We’ll  never  get  out  of  there.’  
I stayed on the top of the capsule and shouted down what I could see.  
‘There’s  a  space  ahead.  Can  you  see  it?’  
‘Prepare  for  landing,’  Per  shouted,  and  shut  off  the  burner.  
I climbed back into the capsule and we headed down. Our groundspeed was around 40 miles an 
hour when we crashed to earth with a hell of a bang. We went skidding across the ground before Per 
managed to fire t he explosive bolts. Mercifully, this time they worked and the capsule ground to a halt 
as the envelope flew off without us. We were strapped in, but in a trice we were struggling to get out. 
Both of us thought the capsule might blow up with the last of the  propane fuel.  
We wrenched open the hatch and clambered outside. We hugged each other and danced a little 
jig in the snow. The silver balloon envelope had draped itself across the pine trees and was being 
shredded by the wind. Then we realised two things: the  capsule  wasn’t  going  to  blow  up,  and  it  was  
minus  60  degrees  outside.  Unless  we  got  back  inside,  we’d  get  frostbite.  We  crawled  inside  the  
capsule and I made radio contact with Watson Lake Flight Service.  
‘We’ve  done  it.  We’ve  arrived.  We’re  all  in  one  piece.’ 
‘Where  are  you?’  
‘We’ve  landed  on  a  lake  surrounded  by  trees.’  ‘It’s  a  frozen  lake,’  came  the  laconic  Canadian  voice.  ‘It’s  quite  safe.  The  only  trouble  is  that  
there  are  about  800,000  lakes  in  your  vicinity  and  they’ve  all  got  plenty  of  trees.’  
We had to wait in our capsule for another eight hours. Per had frostbite in one of his feet, and I 
had frostbite in a finger. We huddled together, half -asleep, eating our supplies, desperate for warmth 
as the snow and wind howled around our metal capsule. W e had landed over 300 miles from the 
nearest habitation, 150 miles from the nearest road, in an area of wilderness about 200 times the size 
of Britain.  
‘We’ve  flown  for  6,761  miles,’  Per  said  with  weary  triumph.  ‘We  flew  for  46  hours  and  6  
minutes. That ma kes our average speed 127 knots, 147 miles per hour. These are all significant 
records.  We’ve  flown  further  than  any  other  balloon  has  ever  flown.’  
‘I’m  dying  for  a  hot  drink,’  was  all  I  could  say,  ‘and  a  log  fire.  And  a  sunny  beach.  Why  aren’t  
we in Calif ornia!’ 
‘Next  time  it’s  the  ultimate  flight,’  Per  started  fantasising.  ‘It’s  round  the  world.’  
When I peered out of the capsule I thought I saw something move. For a moment I thought that it 
was a dog and I had a surreal vision of somebody taking their dog  for a walk along the frozen lake. As 
I watched the creature, it came up to the capsule and sniffed at it. It was an otter. It sniffed around us, 
then  turned  up  its  nose  as  if  to  say,  ‘Big  deal   – a  capsule,’  and  slunk  off.  It  was  the  only  creature  to  
have witnessed that we were the first to cross the Pacific – and  it  didn’t  even  have  a  camera.  
Every five seconds of those eight hours the emergency bleeper went off, piercing our eardrums. 
As we huddled together, I relived the flight and wondered why I had tru sted Per with my life. We had 
landed over 2,000 miles away from our destination; we had lost two fuel tanks; we had caught fire; we 
had flown across the Pacific in the dark with no radio contact. I remembered the previous flights – the 
first attempt from J apan had seen the balloon disintegrate and catch fire, and the Atlantic crossing had 
nearly killed us.  
As Per talked about our flying round the world, I wondered whether I was mad to consider ever 
going with him again. I knew that he had pushed the technol ogical boundaries of balloon flying 
further  forward  than  anyone,  but  it  was  sad  that  we  hadn’t  developed  a  stronger  bond  with  each  other.  
I  get  close  to  most  of  the  people  I  spend  a  long  time  with.  But  Per  is  not  a  team  player.  He’s  a  loner.  
He’s  often  dif ficult  to  read.  He’s  someone  who  is  quick  to  criticise.  I’d  been  brought  up  to  look  for  the  
best in people. Per always seemed to find the worst. Despite this, we somehow managed to get on 
together  as  two  opposites  who  can  respect  each  other’s  strengths  and  weaknesses. And when it comes 
to ballooning I have plenty of weaknesses for him to respect! He also has had to put up with every 
project  we  do  being  branded  a  ‘Branson’  or  ‘Virgin’  challenge,  and  he  copes  with  that  very  well.  
Certainly, we have been throu gh more together than most people experience in a lifetime.  
As I tried to imagine us setting off round the world in a high -altitude balloon, I realised that, for 
all our horrendous moments together, our balloon flights had been some of the greatest adventu res of 
my life. During the rest of my life, I am – to a greater or lesser extent – in control of my destiny. Up in 
a balloon we are at the mercy of the elements, the technology, the teams of engineers who have built 
it, and we are 30,000 feet up. The odds are not the best but I have always been unable to resist taking on odds that look formidable and then proving them wrong. And once again fortune had been kind to 
us. 
At  last  we  heard  the  thudding  sound  of  a  helicopter’s  blades.  It  got  louder  and  louder,  an d then 
the helicopter circled overhead and landed beside us. We had the bags of videos and our logbooks 
ready, and we staggered over to the helicopter, Per limping with frostbite.  
It  was  another  four  hours’  flight  to  Yellowknife.  When  we  landed  at  a  tiny  a irfield, the yellow 
fluorescent lights made blurred circles in the driving snow. We crunched across the snow to the 
hangar. Gusts of flakes blew across us as we opened the door and stepped inside.  
There  was  Will,  Mum,  Dad,  Per’s  wife  Helen,  and  some  people  from Yellowknife. I almost 
didn’t  recognise  anyone  since  they  were  all  wearing  strange  bulky  clothing:  bright -red padded jackets 
and thermal trousers. They roared with delight when we came in.  
‘Have  a  cold  beer!’  Will  shouted.  ‘It’s  all  there  is!’  
Per and I ripped off the ringpulls and sprayed everyone there.  
‘You’ve  made  it!’  said  Mum.  
‘Never  again!’  said  Dad.  
‘What  do  you  mean?’  Per  joked.  ‘We’re  going  round  the  world  next  time.  If  those  fuel  tanks  had  
stayed  on  we’d  be  over  England  now!’  
‘Have  you  got  that  letter  I  gave  you?’  Mum  asked  me.  
It was still in my trouser pocket.  
‘It  was  written  by  some  Japanese  schoolchildren.  You  have  to  give  it  to  the  local  child  closest  to  
where  you  land.’  
One of the ground crew at Yellowknife had brought his six -year-old son along to see these two 
balloonists who had arrived from Japan, so I knelt down and gave him the letter.  
‘It’s  from  some  children  who  live  in  Miyakonojo  in  Japan,’  I  told  him.  ‘You’d  bet ter go there one 
day.  But  perhaps  not  by  balloon!’  
Yellowknife town is so cold in January that diesel freezes solid. In order to stop your car from 
freezing, you either keep the engines running or plug them into special electric supplies which look 
like pa rking  meters  and  heat  the  engines.  We  had  a  meal  in  the  town’s  largest  steak  house,  to  which  
half the people living in Yellowknife turned up. When we came out of the restaurant, we could hardly 
breathe for exhaust fumes. Most of the shops are in undergroun d shopping malls, which are easier to 
heat without the wind -chill to worry about. During the meal a fax arrived from the new prime 
minister, John Major, congratulating us on the flight. Surely Yellowknife was one of the most remote 
places the 10 Downing St reet letterhead has ever found itself.  The next day we said goodbye to the gold miners and fur trappers who had looked after us so 
well  at  such  short  notice.  It’s  not  often  they  have  guests  ballooning  down  on  them  from  Japan,  and  
they invited us to come ag ain. We flew to Seattle and then on to the warmth of Los Angeles. From 
there we caught the plane back to London, and I had a chance to read the newspapers and understand 
what was going on. The stock market had soared on the back of the invasion, and lookin g at the 
amount of firepower the Allied Forces were using it was hard to imagine that Iraq would survive for 
long. I spent some time talking to the crew and the pilots and heard how empty the flights were. One 
of the pilots warned me that the Gulf War was actually hiding a recession that was going to last a very 
long time.  
‘After  all  the  bombing  is  over  and  Saddam  Hussein  is  dead,’  he  said,  ‘the  world  will  suddenly  
realise   that   it   wasn’t   the   “Mother   of   all   Wars”   which   was   the   issue,   but   the   “Mother   of   all  
Recessions”.’ 
 
 
22 Flying into turbulence  
January –February 1991  
FRIDAY 25 JANUARY WAS  the end of a bad week for Sidney Shaw, our account director from 
Lloyds Bank. He sat on the edge of my sofa fidgeting with his pen and papers, refused to have a cup 
of coffe e and then changed his mind. Trevor and I began to worry. Sidney expressed no interest in last 
week’s  Pacific  crossing  and  was  reluctant  to  meet  my  eye.  He  was  behaving  ominously  like  my  old  
Coutts bank manager.  
‘I  saw  Air  Europe  on  Monday  and  Dan  Air  on  W ednesday,’  Sidney  began,  ‘and  I  suspect  that  
you’re  in  much  the  same  trouble.  I’m  afraid  that  we’re  pulling  our  loans  out  of  both  those  airlines,  and  
I  don’t  see  why  we  should  support  you  any  more.  We  can’t  see  how  you  can  possibly  keep  Virgin  
Atlantic goi ng.’ 
It was clear where he was heading. He had come to see us in perhaps the worst week in what 
would  become  the  worst  year  of  aviation  history.  Virgin’s  group  overdraft  facility  with  Lloyds  Bank  
was formally set at £20 million but we had now hit £50 milli on. After a visit by Lloyds Bank on 
Monday and the subsequent withdrawal of their loans, Air Europe – the largest independent short -haul 
airline in Europe – run by Harry Goodman, had been declared bust on Wednesday, with 4,000 
redundancies. As with Laker, B-Cal, Dan Air and of course Virgin Atlantic, British Airways had 
managed to keep Air Europe confined to Gatwick.  
As the Gulf War continued, the price of aviation fuel was still over $1.20 a gallon, and 
passengers were still not flying – and certainly not flying the flag -carriers. To an outsider, the airline 
industry looked like a disaster. Yet, for the rest of the Virgin Group, the picture was pretty good. 
Virgin Communications would reach sales of over £150 million that year on Sega equipment alone. 
Simon  and Ken were having no problems in selling records. Indeed Virgin singers Paula Abdul and Steve Winwood were top of the charts in America, and Bryan Ferry was there in Britain. The Gulf 
War and the gathering recession were not affecting record sales. The Virgin  Megastores  weren’t  
making  much  money,  but  weren’t  losing  anything  either.  
Virgin  Atlantic  was  our  biggest  liability  in  that  we  had  high  overheads  that  we  couldn’t  cut  down.  
But even here the underlying picture was encouraging. Virgin holidaymakers w ere still all taking their 
holidays, and Ron Simms, then managing director of Virgin Holidays (since retired), forecast that we 
would increase this number from 83,000 the previous year to around 100,000 in 1991, a jump of 20 
per cent. Ron had built up Virg in Holidays into one of the most profitable parts of Virgin Travel, and 
since  I’ve  never  known  him  make  a  forecast  that  he  can’t  comfortably  beat  by  several  thousand  I  took  
this as a concrete figure. Given that the average value of a Virgin holiday was £73 0, this meant that 
we would receive sales of over £73 million from these customers alone, and they would be taking 
seats that would otherwise be empty. There was equally good news on the cargo side: the rates for 
cargo to Japan had actually increased. Alan  Chambers, who had successfully built up our cargo 
division, pointed out that so many airlines had suspended services to the Far East that he was now able 
to charge a premium to transport cargo to Japan.  
‘What  are  we  shipping  out  there?’  I  asked  him.  
‘You’d  never  guess,’  he  said.  ‘Scottish  smoked  salmon  and  whisky  are  the  bulk  of  it.  Then  we’re  
bringing  back  computer  games.  It’s  a  roaring  business.’  
It sometimes seems to me that I have spent all my life trying to persuade bankers to extend their 
loans. Give n  that  Virgin’s  policy  has  always  been  to  reinvest  our  surplus  cash  back  into  the  business,  
our profit and loss accounts understate the underlying value of the businesses. This policy has worked 
over the long term, but whenever there is a crisis it disguis es the real picture and means that the banks 
worry about our short -term profits and ability to pay our immediate interest. Trevor explained to 
Sidney Shaw that our balance sheet had included no value either for the Virgin brand name itself or 
for the contr acts with the Virgin artists.  
‘Look,’  I  told  Sidney  Shaw.  ‘In  a  nutshell,  we  have  very  sound  businesses.  The  record  company  
alone  will  make  £30  million  profit  this  year,  and  that’s  in  spite  of  the  cost  of  making  a  massive  
investment  in  America.  It’s  foreca st to make £75 million next year. Virgin Communications and 
Virgin Retail are profitable. The airline, the holiday company and the freight company will also make 
profits  by  the  end  of  the  year.  They’re  just  having  a  bad  patch.  With  the  Gulf  War  and  the  win ter, 
we’ve  got  a  cash -flow shortage of £10 –20 million. This is a tiny percentage of the total value of the 
Virgin  Group  and  it’ll  be  ironed  out  by  the  end  of  the  year.  
‘Anyway,’  I  pointed  out,  ‘we  could  easily  sell  some  or  all  of  Virgin  Music.  The  latest  C itibank 
valuation shows it to be worth $900 million. Now, are you going to withdraw your loan because of a 
temporary  blip  due  to  a  war?’  
‘No,  no,  no,’  Sidney  backed  down.  ‘But  you  must  see  it  from  our  point  of  view.’  
I could see it all too clearly from his  point of view: Virgin Atlantic had a small cash -flow deficit, 
which, despite the great value in the rest of the Group, put us at the mercy of Lloyds Bank. Under the 
British banking system, banks make their money from charging high interest rates rather th an taking 
any kind of equity stake, as they often do in Japan and Germany. British banks therefore have a greater incentive to cut and run from a company than see it through the bad times. It is in desperate 
times like the middle of a war that perfectly go od profitable businesses go bust. The frightening thing 
about an airline is that it can go bust faster than almost any other business: all it takes is for the 
telephones to go quiet and for passengers to stop booking flights. Even a large airline can unrav el in a 
matter of days.  
By the time Sidney Shaw walked away from Holland Park, he seemed to have had most of his 
worries put to rest. He wrote me a letter admitting that his worst fears had been unfounded; he even 
apologised  for  ‘overreacting’.  For  the  time  being,  Lloyds  Bank  was  back on our side. The only trouble 
was that the idea of our selling part or all of Virgin Music was now firmly on their agenda.  
Trevor had made a number of forecasts for 1991, even the worst of which showed that over the 
year Virgin Atlantic would make a profit of £7 million. So we ourselves felt quite confident. However, 
as soon as I arrived back in London I realised that, beyond the immediate concerns of Lloyds Bank, 
there were some wider rumours going around the City that Virgin was going the way of Air  Europe 
and Dan Air and that I was destined to become another Freddie Laker.  
Rather than spending time searching for the right partner to invest in Virgin Music, I had to 
switch my attention to stamping out a bizarre variety of rumours about Virgin Atlanti c. I was closely 
in touch with journalists, and so, when I started receiving a series of calls from them asking me in one 
breath whether there was a drugs problem at Heaven nightclub and in another breath about the 
finances of Virgin Atlantic, I was rather  baffled. Up until then journalists had typically asked me about 
our new services on board the planes, the latest record signing, or what Janet Jackon was really like. 
And  so,  when  ‘serious’  newspapers  began  firing  questions  about  the  drug  scene  at  Heaven,  and in the 
same conversation asking about the impact of currency movements on our profit and loss account, I 
felt that something rather strange was happening. I was bewildered. By the time almost every 
newspaper had inquired about Heaven, I felt that ther e must be some kind of campaign against us. It 
was most odd.  
The news coming from the airline was also disturbing: the number of passengers who booked 
seats   and   then   didn’t   turn   up,   the   ‘no -shows’,   had   increased   way   beyond   the   levels   any   of   us  
remembered s ince we had set up.  
One day Will came into my office looking worried.  
‘I’ve  just  had  a  call  from  a  friend  at  Rothschilds,’  he  said.  ‘Apparently  Lord  King  was  there  for  
lunch yesterday, and he was bad -mouthing  Virgin  Atlantic.’  
An accusation of financial we akness can rapidly become a self -fulfilling prophecy, particularly 
when it comes from as lofty and authoritative a source as Lord King of Wartnaby, whom nobody 
would  think  could  ever  feel  threatened  by  a  tiny  airline  like  Virgin  Atlantic.  Lord  King’s  accus ation of 
Virgin  Atlantic’s  financial  weakness  had  a  number  of  key  audiences.  For  a  start  there  was  the  press,  
which would not be slow to run a story about another successful entrepreneur who, like Alan Bond, 
Ralph Halpern, George Davis, Gerald Ronson, the Reichmanns and many others, was now 
overstretched and running into trouble. But, more significantly for us, Lord King would also be 
listened to by the bankers in the City whom we were considering approaching to place some shares in 
Virgin Atlantic. We had had some preliminary talks with the American bankers, Salomon Brothers, who were preparing a selling document to raise around £20 million. Rumours of our impending 
insolvency would pull the carpet from under our feet when trying to negotiate. The third aud ience 
whose antennae would pick up this rumour was the aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies: 
despite the recession we were looking to expand our fleet, but nobody would do business with a 
crippled airline. The last key audience was in many ways the  most important to us in those first 
months of 1991: the Civil Aviation Authority, which has a duty to ensure that all airline companies are 
trading viably.  
I am no stranger to healthy competition – working hard and playing hard – but there was no love 
lost between Virgin and BA. Over the last two years we had become embroiled in an increasingly 
acrimonious dispute over some maintenance BA had carried out on one of our planes. Thanks to their 
bad servicing, our 747 was grounded for sixteen days in August, t he busiest time of the year.  
In desperation I had called Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of BA.  
‘Your  engineering  was  so  bad  that  it  could  have  brought  an  aircraft  down,’  I  told  him.  
‘That’s  one  of  the  perils  of  being  in  the  aviation  business,’  he  told  me  coldly.  ‘If  you’d  stuck  to  
popular  music  you  wouldn’t  have  had  this  problem.  No,  we  won’t  lend  you  a  plane.’  
All of which meant that, instead of making good money in the summer and living off it through 
the  winter’s  lean  months,  Virgin  Atlantic  had  a  t errible summer and alienated passengers. Since we 
had paid out to lease the replacement aircraft, our cash flow was severely hit. When we tried to agree 
compensation, BA dragged its heels. They owed us several million pounds of compensation and by 
delaying  payment precipitated a cash crisis at the airline which Virgin Music had to bail out. Just 
before I set off to Japan for the balloon flight, we had sued BA.  
Alongside the maintenance dispute, our major battle with British Airways was our application for 
two extra flights a week to Japan, which was being negotiated with the Japanese Government. Flight 
timetables and slots may have no appeal outside the world of aviation, but they form our lifeblood. 
Without  permission  to  fly  somewhere,  we  literally  can’t  ta ke off. The battle over the slots and routes 
to Tokyo was a vital one for Virgin to win if we were to expand.  
After the B -Cal takeover, their four flights to Tokyo had been transferred to Virgin, but it still 
wasn’t  enough.  For  the  route  to  be  viable  we  ne eded to be able to fly daily, and from Heathrow. Surely 
that had to be a priority before BA was allowed to fly twice a day during the week. Two frequencies – 
four slots – were then offered by the Japanese Government. BA naturally presumed they would be 
theirs. After consultations with our lawyers, and even though we knew that BA had already lined up 
for the slots, we made an application. Our future depended on it. If we were successful, Virgin would 
win not just the routes but – crucially – the slots that B A had arranged for them at Narita Airport, 
Tokyo.  
When news of our application leaked out, British Airways went berserk. This kind of thing had 
never happened before: small airlines were meant to just let BA walk all over them and be grateful for 
any slots  at  all.  But  to  ask  for  slots  that  were  ‘rightfully’  theirs!  They  went  into  action.  Lord  King  and  
his  team  lobbied  good  and  hard  that  these  slots  were  British  Airways’  rightful  inheritance  and  that  it  
was illegal to transfer them to Virgin Atlantic. This a rgument backfired:  ‘They’re  not  “your”  slots,’  Malcolm  Rifkind,  the  then  secretary  for  transport,  said  curtly  to  
British  Airways.  ‘They  actually  belong  to  the  government  and  we  issue  them  to  you.  BA  does  not  own  
them.’ 
When British Airways realised that th ey had lost that argument, they turned to more damaging 
allegations, pointing out that Virgin Atlantic was not a financially strong enough airline to take on 
these slots. In fact, they muttered, word was in the trade that Virgin Atlantic was about to go bu st. 
Hence  Lord  King’s  comments  at  the  Rothschilds  lunch.  They  also  wrote  ‘confidential’  letters  to  the  
Department of Transport casting doubts on our finances. This hit the CAA on their Achilles heel. They 
could not award the frequencies to Virgin Atlantic only to see us suddenly go bust.  
We had to battle to persuade the CAA that Virgin Atlantic was a viable airline. Throughout 
January, as the CAA deliberated whether to award these two Tokyo frequencies to us, I heard an 
increasing number of rumours about bo th Virgin and me, all of which implied that we were in trouble.  
Finally, in the last week of January, the CAA made two historic decisions in our favour: it 
awarded the two extra frequencies to Virgin Atlantic, ordering British Airways to hand over to us th e 
slots it had organised at Narita Airport; and it announced that it would recommend to the Department 
of Transport that Virgin Atlantic should be allowed to operate from Heathrow. Lord King was furious. 
As  a  major  donor  to  the  Tory  Party’s  finances,  he  an nounced that he had been betrayed and appealed 
against the Narita decision.  
On 29 January, the first television documentary about the rivalry between Virgin Atlantic and 
British Airways was broadcast by Thames Television. This programme described the battl e we were 
having over the Tokyo frequencies and open access to Heathrow, and also highlighted some of the 
other complaints Virgin Atlantic had about BA, including our long -standing maintenance dispute. The 
day after the Thames Television programme, British  Airways issued a press release which claimed 
that  Virgin  Atlantic  was  abusing  them.  It  referred  to  our  attack  on  them  as  an  ‘onslaught’.  
After hearing of another tirade of abuse from Lord King about me, and recognising that it could 
indirectly drive Virgi n  Atlantic  bust,  I  wanted  to  have  the  rumours  stopped.  I  didn’t  mind  competition  
from British Airways or anyone else as long as it was fair competition, but I continued to hear a 
growing collection of damaging rumours.  
On 31 January, I wrote my first lette r to Lord King. I hoped that by bringing matters out into the 
open I would be able to stop the rumours. I have always believed that personal relationships are vital 
in business and that people should be directly accountable for their actions. If I alerted Lord King to 
what he had set in motion, I hoped that he would then call me and we would have a quick chat about it 
and bury the hatchet. I wrote:  
  
I am writing to put on record to you that I resent the level of personal abuse your people at British 
Airways have recently resorted to. As chairman of a small independent airline I have behaved no 
differently than you would have done in my place. I have a rgued our case with the CAA over 
Tokyo slots. They have decided in our favour. That decision is now under review. We have argued our case for access to Heathrow. The CAA have decided in our favour and we are waiting 
on  the  secretary  of  state’s  final  decisi on. 
In none of these issues have we behaved improperly. We have sought remedies through the 
CAA, the Department of Transport, the EEC and the High Court when appropriate. We have not 
at any stage made offensive personal remarks about you or Sir Colin Marsh all. I would expect the 
same courtesy from your company.  
My letter was wishful thinking.  
The next week Will was called by a man who introduced himself as Frank Dobson, private 
detective. He said that he wanted to have an urgent meeting with Will. He sugges ted a pub underneath 
Waterloo Station. Will went along with Gerrard Tyrrell, our lawyer from Harbottle and Lewis. Frank 
Dobson told them that a detective agency called Kroll Associates was investigating me and the whole 
Virgin Group. Frank Dobson asked Wil l whether he could work for Virgin to counteract whatever 
Kroll were up to. Will thanked him for his information but turned down the offer of his help since we 
never use private detectives.  
I  received  Lord  King’s  reply  on  5  February.  He  merely  quoted  what   he had said to the Sunday 
Telegraph :  ‘I  run  my  airline;;  Richard  Branson  runs  his.  Best  of  luck  to  him.’  He  added  that  he  
intended to say nothing more on the subject.  
The  letter’s  brevity  was  matched  only  by  its  arrogance.  It  was  clear  that  Lord  King  treated  me  
with a contempt that would rub off on how everyone at British Airways felt they could treat Virgin 
Atlantic.  
Lord  King’s  letter  contained  two  short  sentences.  Lo rd  King  did  not  mean  me  to  have  the  ‘best  of  
luck’.  Indeed,  if  he  could  have  anything  to  do  with  it,  luck  would  not  enter  into  it.  And  Lord  King  
would  go  on  to  say  a  great  deal  about  ‘the  subject’  to  a  number  of  people.  
The other peculiar thing about Lord King’s  letter  was  that  it  did  not  address  me  personally  but  
only quoted a response he had made to a newspaper. It was as if he could not bring himself to address 
me  as  a  person  or  even  acknowledge  me.  I  knew  that  he  had  coined  the  contemptuous  expression  ‘ the 
grinning  pullover’  to  describe  me.  In  the  same  way  that  British  Airways  was  trying  to  steamroller  
Virgin  Atlantic  out  of  sight,  it  struck  me  that  Lord  King  was  pretending  I  didn’t  even  exist.  
 
 
 
 
 23 Dirty tricks  
February –April 1991  
IN THE AFTERMATH OF  the Thames Television programme, more alarming proof emerged of 
some kind of campaign against me and Virgin.  
‘I’ve  had  a  call  from  an  ex -British  Airways  man,’  Chris  Moss,  our  marketing  manager  at  Virgin  
Atlantic,  told  me.  ‘Peter  Fleming  saw  the  Thames  Televisi on programme and says that he can confirm 
all  sorts  of  things  BA  have  been  up  to.’  
‘Will  he  write  it  down?’  I  asked.  ‘Is  it  hard  evidence?’  
‘He  says  that  Virgin  is  BA’s  number -one enemy and that after the Baghdad flight they set up a 
special team to underm ine  you.’ 
‘Can  you  get  it  in  writing?’  
‘I’ll  try.’ 
Throughout February and March we discussed with Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, the 
question of the disputed Tokyo frequencies and our access to Heathrow. He was a down -to-earth Scot 
who gave us a very fair hearing. I really felt that he was on our wavelength when he pointed out how 
vastly improved the Heathrow –Glasgow shuttle was:  
‘I  now  get  a  decent  meal  with  proper  cutlery,’  he  said.  ‘It  used  to  be  a  damp  little  white  
sandwich.’ 
‘That’s  British  Midland  bringing  in  some  competition,’  I  pointed  out.  ‘They’ve  got  the  slots  to  do  
it  from  Heathrow.’  
I thought our lunch meeting had gone well, but right at the end he floored me:  
‘Richard,’  he  said.  ‘You  must  admit  that  BA  does  do  an  excellent  job.’  
‘Yes,  they’re  much  improved,’  I  agreed.  ‘But  they  have  been  given  everything  on  a  plate:  for  
instance they were given Concorde for nothing with all the debts written off, and they were given the 
exclusive  use  of  Heathrow.’  
‘They  were,’  Rifkind  admitted.  ‘But   it’s  all  in  the  national  interest.’  
Silence fell between us. To my mind he had just undermined the entire lunch.  
‘There’s  no  national  interest  at  stake  here,’  I  argued.  ‘British  Airways  is  just  a  large  airline  which  
is owned by its shareholders. It happens  to  have  a  monopoly  because  that’s  what  it  was  given  while  it  
was  nationalised.  But  it’s  no  longer  like  Aeroflot.  Think  of  your  old  white  sandwiches  on  the  Glasgow  
shuttle. And, unlike other privatised monopolies, which have their market dominance reduced by regulators, BA has no regulator and has actually been allowed to increase its dominance since it was 
privatised.’ 
I thought that I might have gone too far because Malcolm Rifkind nodded rather awkwardly and 
made his way to the black Rover outside. I kne w  that  he’d  never  flown  Virgin  because  all  members  of  
parliament, all civil servants, all soldiers, were still encouraged to fly British Airways as if it was 
somehow  still  the  ‘national  carrier’.  As  I  watched  his  car  head  off  back  to  Westminster,  I  wondere d 
whether he really believed that British Airways operated in the national interest or whether he had just 
been  playing  devil’s  advocate.  
‘Good  news,  Richard,’  said  Malcolm  Rifkind  on  15  March  1991.  ‘I  am  pleased  to  say  that  the  
government is going to allo w Virgin Atlantic to operate from Heathrow. And, on top of this, we are 
also  going  to  nominate  you  as  the  British  carrier  to  operate  the  two  extra  flights  to  Tokyo.’  
It was the crucial turning point we had been waiting for.  
‘Fantastic  news!’  I  shouted.  ‘Pe nni,  let’s  have  some  champagne!  Call  down  Will.  Call  down  
everyone!’ 
As  everyone  gathered  in  my  office  to  celebrate,  I  dialled  Hugh  Welburn’s  number.  Hugh  had  
written a paper that pointed out the critical importance for an airline of operating from Heathro w. The 
paper’s  conclusion  was  that,  due  to  the  single  short  runway  at  Gatwick  and  the  lack  of  connecting  
flights, an identical route from Heathrow would be 15 per cent more profitable than one from 
Gatwick.  Hugh’s  paper,  and  the  revelation  that  Virgin  woul d be able to fly more cargo from the longer 
Heathrow runways and thus earn more taxable revenue, had made a powerful impression on Malcolm 
Rifkind.  
‘We’ve  won,’  I  told  Hugh.  ‘Well  done.  We’ve  finally  managed  to  get  into  Heathrow.’  
Hugh was delighted and am azed. He had been a consultant in the aviation industry for a long 
time, and he had seen the demise of British Caledonian and several other smaller airlines that had 
failed to make ends meet from Gatwick.  
‘This  is  your  breakthrough,’  he  said.  ‘But  watch  out.  British  Airways  won’t  like  it  at  all   – they’ll  
go  berserk.’ 
As we drank champagne, the telephone started ringing with calls from journalists who had picked 
up the story. They were also ringing up Lord K ing, and the following day and over the weekend I read 
his reaction with interest:  
‘Government  transport  policy?’  Lord  King  snorted  in  the   Observer , of which his son -in-law 
Melvin  Marckus  was  the  business  editor.  ‘What  transport  policy?’  
I   didn’t   know   whet her to laugh at the interview or be annoyed. I read on with growing 
amazement:  
‘It  seems  that  every  time  we  build  up  a  profitable  route,’  Lord  King  went  on  to  say,  ‘someone  
comes  along  and  says,  “I’ll  have  some  of  that,”  and  the  government  obliges.’  Lord K ing  estimated  that  Malcolm  Rifkind’s  decision  to  allow  Virgin  Atlantic  to  fly  the  extra  
two  flights  to  Tokyo  would  cost  BA  around  £250  million  a  year  in  lost  revenue:  ‘That  is  £250  million  
of revenue lost to our public shareholders which has gone straight into  Richard  Branson’s  back  
pocket,’  he  fulminated.  
If only revenue did go straight into my back pocket. Perhaps in his rage Lord King had forgotten 
that there are costs that unfortunately crop up between revenue and profit.  
On the same day the Sunday Telegraph  commented:  
  
This week Lord King was breathing fire over the decision finally to allow Virgin into Heathrow. 
Its  long  confinement  at  Gatwick  has  been  a  boon  to  BA  and  now  I  can  see  why.  British  Airways’  
approach to its services is hideboun d by the managerial thinking of a national airline while Virgin 
has all the cheek, determination and original thinking of the whippersnapper entrepreneur 
snapping at the heels of the giant conglomerate. In terms of food and service, upper -class Virgin 
is like first class.  
In the Observer  Lord King argued, no doubt with a straight face, that each time the government 
tried to foster a strong second airline it ended in disaster. He gave the examples of Laker Airlines, 
British Caledonian and Air Europe. This wa s stunning hypocrisy. British Airways had helped push 
Freddie Laker out of business – a grand jury was empanelled to look into the issue but, ultimately, no 
charges were brought after the intervention of the UK and US Governments. All three airlines had 
been confined to Gatwick. British Airways championed the benefits of competition, as long as the 
competition stayed out of sight at Gatwick.  
My  parents  had  always  drilled  into  me  that  the  best  motto  to  follow  is  ‘Nothing  ventured;;  nothing  
gained’.  By  fightin g tooth and claw for access to Heathrow, we had finally won. Virgin Atlantic was 
still tiny in comparison with British Airways, but we were now a serious threat to their long -term 
future in a way that British Caledonian had never been.  
The demise of PanAm and TWA was also to play a role in the question of our access to 
Heathrow. American Airlines and United Airlines, the two giant American carriers, moved in to buy 
the rights to the routes into Heathrow that PanAm and TWA had operated. In order for these ro utes to 
be activated, the two airlines asked for the Heathrow slots to be transferred over to them. Under the 
strict letter of the Traffic Distribution Rules these slots could not be transferred but should revert to 
the Heathrow Slot Committee. We immediat ely argued that, if this should happen, then Virgin 
Atlantic should be allowed to apply for them alongside all other carriers who were interested in flying 
from Heathrow. Although Malcolm Rifkind had opened up Heathrow in principle, we still had a battle 
on our hands over how we would actually get the slots to fly from there.  
The letter I had asked Chris Moss to try to extract from the British Airways employee, Peter Fleming, 
came through on the following Monday morning. It added to my sense of unease. Date d 18 March, 
Peter  Fleming’s  letter  said:  
  There  is  no  doubt  that  BA’s  UK  sales  management  had  Virgin  as  public  enemy  number  one.  The  
real crisis was precipitated by the high profile Richard Branson achieved during his campaign to 
return hostages from the Gulf. During this period I was debriefed from a UK sales management 
meeting  and  told  that  a  management  team  had  been  set  up  to  undermine  the  ‘Branson  image’.  
The development of actions in the European Courts [Virgin had put in a formal complaint] 
has howev er  precipitated  a  thorough  ‘cover -up’  of  activities.  In  the  last  few  months  at  BA  I  was  
told  on  three  separate  occasions  to  destroy  ‘any  reference  to  Virgin  in  [my]  files’.  Staff  in  
sensitive  areas  have  been  briefed  on  ‘anti -trust’  laws  and  how  to  respond   to a sensitive situation 
involving Virgin. Actually, the current situation is verging on paranoia!  
Peter  Fleming  had  been  a  senior  marketing  executive  based  at  BA’s  Victoria  office.  This  was  the  
first real intimation I had that British Airways had actually  set up a special internal unit to discredit 
me, and had ordered the shredding of documents relating to Virgin. Why were those documents so 
incriminating  that  they  needed  to  be  shredded?  I  decided  to  put  Peter  Fleming’s  letter  on  file  while  we  
watched to s ee  how  the  British  Airways  campaign,  which  became  known  as  their  ‘dirty  tricks’  
campaign, developed.  
In the meantime, we had plenty to do. If Virgin Atlantic was going to operate from Heathrow, we 
had to set up check -in desks, baggage handlers, an engineer ing team, and of course we had to have a 
working timetable to offer our passengers. This meant being allocated slots. Only when we had the 
slots in place could Virgin Atlantic set up a timetable and then sell tickets. If we were going to benefit 
from the b usy summer traffic we had to have these in place by April at the latest. Every single item 
was a battle. It was only through battling ferociously, and saying that we would take the entire issue of 
slot allocation to the European Commission, that we were ev entually given the slots we needed.  
While I was locked in my debate with the Heathrow Slot Committee, Jordan Harris and Jeff Ayeroff, 
who ran our American record label, called me to say that Janet Jackson had told them she would like 
to sign up with Virgin  Music. This was as sensational a breakthrough for Virgin Music as winning 
access  to  Heathrow  was  for  Virgin  Atlantic.  Janet  Jackson  was  the  world’s  top  female  singer  and  I  
recognised that she had the single -minded determination to stay at the top. She wan ted to become even 
more  successful  than  her  brother  Michael.  Alongside  talent,  one  of  the  deciding  factors  in  a  singer’s  
success is their mental strength. And Janet had plenty of that. She had built up her success over a 
number of records. In many ways it is better for a band if they take a long time to build their success 
since they can then learn to live with it, and they have a broader, more loyal, fan base.  
Although Janet told me that she would like to sign with Virgin, there was still to be an auction for 
her and Virgin would have to match the highest offer before her preference for us would swing it. It 
was going to cost far more money than we had at our immediate disposal, but I instinctively knew that 
we had to have her: signing Janet Jackson would c onfirm  Virgin’s  position  as  the  world’s  sexiest  
record company. I was damned if I was going to let the caution of our bankers stop us.  
Throughout my business life I have always tried to keep on top of costs and protect the downside 
risk as much as possible . The Virgin Group has survived only because we have always kept tight 
control of our cash. But, likewise, I also know that sometimes it is essential to break these rules and 
spend lavishly. The chance of signing Janet Jackson was one of these moments: she  could not be 
missed. After talking with Simon and Ken, I decided to offer Janet the largest amount of money ever to be offered to any singer. On top of this, I decided to break all the rules of the record industry: rather 
than tying her down for a number of future albums, Virgin would offer her a contract for just one 
album. This was virtually unprecedented. I wanted to blow away the competition. I felt confident that 
once  Janet  started  working  with  Virgin  she  wouldn’t  want  to  go  anywhere  else.  
As well as cementing  Virgin  Music’s  position  as  the  best  record  label,  signing  Janet  Jackson  
would send out the right message to all the people in the City and the CAA who might believe the 
British Airways rumours that the Virgin Group was suffering a cash crisis.  
The only trouble was that we were indeed suffering a cash crisis. I knew that we would receive 
no help from Lloyds Bank if I asked for an extension of the overdraft to sign her, so Trevor and I 
looked for ways to juggle our assets and find more finance so th at we could make the down payment. 
After a number of rapid meetings with banks, Trevor finally won the approval of the Bank of Nova 
Scotia, who told us that they would fund the Janet Jackson contract.  
We offered Janet Jackson $15 million, with a payment of  $5 million on signature. However, the 
auction soon topped that and we had to jump up to $20 million and finally $25 million, just for the one 
album. It was millions more dollars than any record company had ever paid for a single album. We 
pointed out to t he  bank  that  Janet  was  the  world’s  top  female  singer  and  she  had  had  more  top -five 
singles from her last album than any other singer, including her brother Michael. The Bank of Nova 
Scotia assured us that they would stretch to the $25 million.  
As good as h er word, when the bidding levelled out at $25 million, Janet chose Virgin. The 
contract  was  ours  for  the  signing  and  we  had  to  find  $11  million  to  pay  her  upon  signature.  I  don’t  
think Janet had any idea of the effort it took to scrape the money together, or of the wild plane dashes 
across  the  world  with  banker’s  drafts  that  were  necessary  to  meet  her  deadline   – but somehow we did 
it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 24 The kick boxer in the first room  
April –July 1991  
WE DECIDED TO PAY  a huge sum – some $25 million – to sign up Janet Jackson. But such a huge 
debt caused alarm bells to ring at Lloyds Bank as they saw us take on board another load of debt, 
Trevor and Robert managed to sell the European licence to distribute Sega computer games back to 
the parent company,  Sega in Japan. We needed the cash and we needed to show the outside world 
some of the hidden value within the Virgin Group. None of the bankers had put much value on the 
licence, but we sold it for £33 million. The sale was also perfectly timed: a year la ter the bottom fell 
out of the computer -games market, and the yen soared, which would have sliced the value of the 
licence to practically nothing.  
Virgin had acquired the European licence to distribute Sega games in 1988, when we bought the 
company who own ed it, Mastertronic. At the time we had little idea of the potential of the computer -
games business. All I knew was that Holly, Sam and their friends were suddenly spending a lot of time 
playing computer games on the television. While Trevor was at MAM he spent time with Sega as he 
leased out their arcade machines. He felt sure that Sega would be able to draw upon their software 
expertise to rival Nintendo, and that their new portfolio of small machines to play with at home would 
sell well. It seemed like a  good business to get into.  
Mastertronic was only five years old. Frank Hermann had set it up in 1983 and acquired the 
rights to a number of computer games. At that time he distributed these games, which were on 
cassettes and played on consoles, through ne wsagents. Frank noticed that a new games series 
manufactured by Nintendo was selling well in America. He tried to sign up the licence to distribute 
Nintendo in Britain, but Nintendo had already signed it to Mattel, a large toy manufacturer. Nintendo 
had a 95 per cent share of the computer -games market in America, so Frank went to see its only other 
competitor,  Sega.  He  signed  up  to  become  Sega’s  British  distributor  in  1986,  and  in  the  first  year  his  
company managed to sell 20,000 Sega Megadrives.  
The next y ear,   1987,   Mastertronic’s   sales   of   Sega   were   soaring   but,   given   that   Sega   were  
charging £55 for a console, Frank needed a partner to finance the sales. Although he could sell the 
consoles for £99, he needed a large amount of working capital to finance the gap between the £55 
outlay to Sega for supplying the console, which was cash in advance, and receiving the £99 from 
selling it.  
In June 1987 I was telephoned by Roger Seelig, who asked me to come and meet a friend of his, 
Frank Hermann, who had stumbled in to this rather amazing business. Trevor and Simon Burke 
negotiated to buy a 45 per cent stake in Mastertronic, and we put it in with Virgin Communications. 
Frank and Robert started working together and they bought the licence to distribute Sega in Spain, 
France and Germany for five years. Their challenge was to build the Sega name from scratch in 
Europe. Virgin marketed Sega as the cool game to play, and initially we sold it on the basis that, while 
your younger brother may be happy with Nintendo games such  as Super Mario and Gameboy, the 
smarter  games  for  smarter  kids  were  ones  such  as  Sega’s  Sonic  the  Hedgehog.  Then,  as  the  market  
developed rapidly, we found that younger and younger boys were buying Sonic: they all wanted to be 
like their older brothers. O ur trick was to position Sega above Nintendo and force them further and further downmarket. And it worked: in Europe Sega overtook Nintendo with a 45 per cent market 
share, compared with a tiny market share back home in Japan.  
By 1991 the sales of Sega in Europe had soared to £150 million, up from £2 million in 1988. By 
then we were beginning to be rather terrified that the bubble might burst. In order to maintain our 
position we were having to spend £70 million marketing Sega each year, before the cost of financing 
the sales. There was always the danger that, because these games were primarily sold to an extremely 
narrow  section  of  teenage  boys,  if  another  craze  came  along  out  of  the  blue,  then  Sega’s  sales  would  
collapse. Peer pressure ensures that nobody wants to be left behind for a moment.  
At home I noticed that Sam and Holly began to grow bored with their computer games. They 
spent less time tapping away at their consoles and Gameboys. Sam began to listen to music more, and 
Holly began to do other thing s. Just as they had turned us on to the idea of buying into this business, 
so Holly and Sam gave us the first warning signs that the market was topping out. If we stayed in the 
business we would have to commit to another huge budget for promoting Sega. It was time to sell.  
The sale of the Sega licence surprised both the outside world and our bankers: £33 million in 
cash had been conjured up for a business on which they had placed no value. This was over ten times 
our original purchase price.  
Before starting  discussions to sell the Sega licence, Robert had hived off the small team who 
wrote the software programmes into a separate company called Virgin Interactive. In 1990 the next 
wave of technology would be games which were played on compact disc, and Robert  commissioned a 
number of software writers to come up with programmes for CDs. Without Sega and Sonic the 
Hedgehog to worry about, the tiny team of software programmers that Robert had assembled in 
America began to devise a new game for CD -ROM technology. They  named  it  ‘The  7th  Guest’,  and  I  
noticed that people were growing increasingly excited about it. It was a game that involved battling 
your way through a haunted house while all kinds of attacks were launched at you without warning.  
‘I’ve  no  idea  what  h appens  in  this  game  since  I’m  always  killed  by  the  kick  boxer  in  the  first  
room,’  Robert  told  me.  ‘All  I  know  is  that  these  guys  tell  me  that  The  7th  Guest  is  going  to  be  big.  
They  say  it’s  way  ahead  of  anything  else  on  the  market.’  
As the world of virtual  reality and CD -ROMs expanded and kids fought their way out of haunted 
houses on their computer screens, I found myself in an equally weird world in which I had to fight off 
a growing number of attacks that arrived from every side without warning.  
‘Perhaps it  was  just  a  bad  day  but  one  of  Virgin’s  passengers  was  clearly  not  impressed  with  the  
service  in  upper  class  last  week.  An  entry  in  the  visitors’  book  read:  “No  wonder  your  boss  travels  
round  the  world  in  a  balloon.”’  
This  was  a  small  piece  entitled  ‘ VERDICT ON VIRGIN ’  among  the  sheaf  of  press  cuttings  I  
looked through one Monday morning in June 1991. The journalist was Frank Kane, who wrote 
extensively about aviation and in particular British Airways; the newspaper was the Sunday 
Telegraph , of which Lor d King was a nonexecutive director. I picked up the phone and called Syd 
Pennington, the managing director at Virgin Atlantic:  ‘Did  you  see  that  piece  in  the   Sunday Telegraph?  Please can you send me the pages of the 
visitors’  book  for  the  last  fortnight?’  
It sounded all wrong to me. We had so few passenger complaints that I felt sure that the crew 
would  have  alerted  me  to  this  one.  I  found  the  entry  in  the  visitors’  book.  It  read  exactly  as  Frank  
Kane  had  quoted  it,  but  he’d  missed  out  the  punch  line:  ‘But   seriously,  I  had  a  great  time.’  
All  the  other  quotes  in  the  book  about  that  flight  were  highly  complimentary.  I  don’t  mind  bad  
press as long as it is accurate, but this clearly was not. I traced the passenger, Cathy Holland, and 
phoned her up to check that  she’d  had  a  good  flight.  She  assured  me  that  she’d  had  a  wonderful  flight  
and that – as  she’d  made  clear   – it was just a joke. Then I wrote to the Sunday Telegraph  and pointed 
out that Frank Kane had failed to quote her comment in its entirety. I knew tha t many elderly Sunday 
Telegraph  readers would be sceptical about flying Virgin anyway, but this snippet would put them off 
even more. What was a casual mean joke to a journalist meant many thousands of lost pounds to 
Virgin Atlantic – and to my bankers. Wo rse still, Carol Thatcher then read the piece out on television 
on the David Frost show. I wrote to her pointing out that the journalist had misled her, but the damage 
was done. Six million viewers did not know that this comment was taken out of context.  
I called up Frank Kane to complain and he was apologetic.  
‘Oops,  I’m  sorry  about  that  misquote,’  he  said.  ‘I  looked  over  a  neighbour’s  shoulder  and  that’s  
all  I  could  see.’  
‘That’s  all  right,’  I  said.  
‘There  was  another  comment  in  the  book,’  Kane  went  on.  ‘ It  said,  “I  couldn’t  get  a  seat  on  the  
BA  flight  because  they  were  giving  tickets  away  today.  I’m  glad.  I  shall  fly  Virgin  from  now  on.”’  
On 7 July Virgin started flying in and out of Heathrow. As Hugh Welburn had predicted, our sales on 
the three routes w e offered, JFK, Tokyo and Los Angeles, rapidly increased by 15 per cent. On 14 
July,  British  Airways’  internal  magazine,   BA News , published an article entitled ‘VIRGIN  OUT  TO  
SNATCH  MORE  SLOTS’ , and once again said how unfair it was that a lower -priced com petitor 
should be allowed to compete with them.  
Then, on 16 July, Lord King stood up at the British Airways Annual General Meeting and 
announced that British Airways would stop making its annual donations to the Conservative Party. 
Lord King had failed to spot that this gave away the fact that they thought that donating money to the 
Conservatives in the past had helped them secure various privileges. Some critics pointed out that 
these same donations, which totalled £180,000 since BA had been privatised in 1987, had helped 
secure a sympathetic hearing whenever British Airways needed to speak to the Department of 
Transport. If an airline in Nigeria gave money and free air tickets to the ruling party in return for being 
granted a monopoly, it would be scorned in  the  West  as  being  blatantly  corrupt.  ‘It’s  impossible  to  do  
business  in  Africa!’  people  would  retort.  ‘Look  at  the  Nigerians:  they’re  so  damned  corrupt!’  The  
round of applause that British Airways won for this announcement at its Annual General Meeting on 
16 July struck me as amusing.  
Indeed,  BA’s  influence  went  further  than  merely  giving  money  to  the  Conservative  Party.  During  
the summer I gave a presentation to a group of MPs about the lack of competition in British aviation. Afterward, I was having a drink with the MPs and found myself chatting to two of them about their 
holiday plans.  
‘Have  you  seen  your  travel  agent  yet?’  one  asked.  
‘No,  I’m  just  going  to  give  them  a  call  to  get  my  free  ticket.’  
‘Who’s  this  travel  agent?’  I  asked.  
‘British  Airways,  of  course!’  they  chorused.  
When  Lord  King  stopped  British  Airways’  donations  to  the  Conservatives,  I  hoped  that  it  would  
put British Airways as firmly out of favour as the previous donations had clearly kept them in favour. 
I also hoped t hat  the  government  would  start  encouraging  more  competition.  The  day  after  BA’s  
AGM, Sir Michael Bishop, the chairman of British Midland, and I released a press statement which 
congratulated the British Government on freeing up Heathrow, and supported it a gainst British 
Airways’  criticism.  
Despite the excitement of starting our Heathrow operation in July 1991, it was clear that Virgin 
Atlantic  would  be  unable  to  expand  any  further  for  a  while.  In  the  event,  we  couldn’t  offer  a  new  route  
for another three ye ars, until we started flying to Hong Kong in 1994. This was due to one of the 
fiercest, most focused and vicious attacks ever launched by an airline against a smaller competitor.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 25 ‘Sue  the  bastards’.  
September –October 1991  
WE WERE UP AT MILL END  one week end in September 1991 when it really looked as if my world 
was falling apart. After the high point of signing Janet Jackson and getting into Heathrow earlier in the 
year, everything was now going wrong. With the burden of funding the Janet Jackson deal, ev en 
Virgin Music was having difficulties. And the airline was stretched almost to breaking point by trying 
to  operate  out  of  both  Gatwick  and  Heathrow.  On  top  of  that,  the  rumours  about  Virgin’s  financial  
troubles were mounting. It was rather like being eng ulfed in a bush fire: although I kept stamping out 
flames, I was aware that more and more people were talking about my impending bankruptcy. I had 
taken so many telephone calls from journalists demanding to know whether our cheques were 
bouncing that I cou ld barely think straight. I needed some fresh air and privacy, so I walked round the 
lake several times to try to work out what to do. I felt overwhelmed by the problems I faced.  
Although  we  had  signed  Janet,  I  was  growing  increasingly  worried  about  Simon’ s commitment to 
Virgin Music. He had stopped going out to clubs to search for new talent and, as a result, Virgin had 
failed to break any significant new bands for a couple of years. In many ways, breaking a new band is 
the acid test of how dynamic a recor d company is. I knew that Simon was worried that the value of his 
shares in Virgin Music was at risk if something went wrong with Virgin Atlantic. But, equally, I was 
worried that his lack of commitment to Virgin Music would damage the value of my sharehol ding. His 
heart  wasn’t  in  the  business  any  more,  and  he  seemed  more  interested  in  his  own  personal  projects.  
Virgin Atlantic was having an extremely hard time competing with British Airways. Our 
engineering teams were now driving three or four times a day between Heathrow and Gatwick to 
service each flight, and if a flight was delayed at one airport it had a knock -on effect in the other. Will 
had  heard  that  Lord  King  was  going  around  announcing  proudly  that  the  ‘battle  of  Fortress  Heathrow  
has been won – Virgin’s  about  to  collapse’.  
On top of all this, BA was now blatantly poaching our passengers. We had two reports that BA 
had called up a Virgin Atlantic passenger at home and tried to persuade them to change their flight 
from Virgin to BA. Our staff had als o seen BA staff approaching Virgin Atlantic passengers at the 
terminals and trying to persuade them to switch to BA.  
I was caught in the middle between Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Music. I was alone in being the 
only person with a foot in each camp. The onl y other thing that bound them together was Lloyds 
Bank, in that the loans which Lloyds had made to Virgin Atlantic were guaranteed by Virgin Music. 
This  was  the  crux  of  Simon’s  worry,  but  the  airline  would  not  have  been  able  to  function  any  other  
way. 
Our troubles at Virgin Atlantic brought the question of the future of Virgin Music to a head. 
Throughout the summer, Simon, Trevor, Ken, Robert and I had tried to work out what to do. I had 
effectively put the idea of the possible sale of the record company to  the back of my mind, but with 
the rumours about Virgin Atlantic mounting into a great wave I realised that something had to give.  
‘Have  you  seen  this?’  Will  brought  in  the  new  issue  of   Fortune  on Monday morning. It had a 
photograph of me lounging on the f loating deck chair in Necker Island. I was holding a book entitled Mavericks in Paradise ,  and  the  caption  was:  ‘Richard  Branson,  founder  of  the  Virgin  Group,  savours  
the  billionaire’s  life  …  in  the  British  Virgin  Islands  naturally!’  
I read with interest th at I was worth $1.5 billion.  
‘I  hope  Lloyds  read  this.’  
‘They  may  read  it,’  Will  said.  ‘But  will  they  believe  it?’  
‘It’s  in  the  papers,’  I  laughed.  ‘It  must  be  true!’  
‘WILL  RICHARD  BRANSON’S  BALLOON  BURST?’  was the headline on Wednesday 2 October. 
The enti re page of the Guardian ’s  business  section  was  devoted  to  discussing  my  debts.  ‘Behind  the  
Man with the Midas touch there is a picture of a highly indebted and not -very-profitable 
conglomerate,’   it   read.   The   subheadline   was:   ‘THE   MELODY   LINGERS   BUT   WON’T   M EET 
INVESTMENT  NEEDS’ . This article had come out of the blue. Normally when journalists do a 
profile, even for a hatchet job, they contact me to go over some of the ground. But this Guardian  
journalist had never made contact.  
I  started  reading:  ‘The  latest  available accounts for the Virgin companies show an alarming 
picture  of  faltering  cash  flows  failing  to  meet  the  companies’  investment  requirements.’  I  looked  
through the article with a horrible feeling that this could inspire a host of other newspaper st ories 
along similar lines. If it looked to informed financial journalists that Virgin was in such trouble, then 
the bankers would head straight back to their vaults, taking their money with them.  
‘Virgin  therefore  remains  highly  exposed,’  the  article  concl uded.  ‘It  remains  tiny  by  comparison  
with its key competitors. Its main businesses are in highly volatile industries. The legacy of the buy -
back, together with the ballooning growth of the empire, keep debts at stubbornly high levels. The 
Branson balloon a ppears to be pursuing a dangerous path to the stratosphere. It is an exciting journey, 
undertaken  with  no  shortage  of  panache,  but  Mr  Branson’s  balloon  journeys  are  unfortunate  models  
for  any  business  to  follow.’  
This article had caught us at our most vulnerable. All the accounts were shown in the worst 
possible light. To the world at large, or at any rate to the Guardian ’s  readers,  it  looked  as  if  I  was  in  
the same boat as Alan Bond: Richard Branson was sinking fa st. 
The phone started ringing with other journalists asking for my reaction, and I went through the 
response which Will and I had drafted. We tried to emphasise how factually inaccurate the figures 
were, how the article ignored the intangible value of Virg in  Music’s  contracts,  and  how  it  put  no  value  
on  Virgin  Atlantic’s  aircraft.  I  was  due  to  fly  to  Japan  that  day  and,  with  the  flight  leaving  at  5p.m.,  I  
didn’t  have  much  time  to  respond  to  the   Guardian .  I  began  scribbling  a  letter  to  the  newspaper’s  
editor . I tried to shrug off the article:  
  
There are many inaccuracies that could have been avoided in your article ‘WILL  RICHARD  
BRANSON’S  BALLOON  BURST?’  if your journalist had had the courtesy of speaking with me 
before  writing  it.  Since  I’m  off  to  Japan  in   a few minutes (amusingly in the context of this letter to  be  made  a  doctor  of  economics!)  I’ll  spare  your  readers  a  long  list  of  them.  However,  to  give  
you  but  one  inaccuracy,  our  profits  didn’t  ‘plunge’  as  a  public  company   – they doubled!  
I went on to arg ue that the net worth of all my companies after repayment of every debt was 
around £1 billion. Will came down to discuss the letter.  
‘It’s  got  to  be  more  than  a  letter  on  this  one,’  Will  said.  ‘You’ve  been  attacked  with  a  whole -page 
article. What I want to  do  is  get  them  to  give  you  a  whole  page  to  defend  yourself.’  
‘They’ll  never  do  that.’  
‘They  might.  It’ll  cause  a  commotion  and  that’s  good  for  the   Guardian .  It’s  better  than  a  letter  
tucked  away  on  page  27  that  nobody  will  read.’  
Together, we wrote out a whole article rebutting the Guardian ’s  piece,  but  before  I  could  finish  it  
I had to leave for Tokyo. The moment I arrived there Will was back on the phone:  
‘OK,  we’ve  got  half  a  page,’  he  said.  ‘It’s  better  than  nothing.  I’m  faxing  you the draft. The 
Guardian  thought we might sue them so I think they were relieved when we asked for the right to 
reply.’ 
I called up Trevor and asked what Lloyds thought of the piece.  
‘Funnily  enough,  they’re  quite  relaxed  about  it,’  he  told  me.  
When I telephoned Lloyds I found out why.  
‘Yes,  I  did  see  the  piece,’  John  Hobley  said,  ‘but  I  don’t  think  many  other  people  did.  In  any  
event, nobody I know takes the Guardian  very seriously. If that piece had been in the Daily Telegraph  
or the FT it would have been  a  different  matter.’  
‘Now,  what’s  your  decision  on  the  loan?’  I  tried  to  sound  casual,  as  if  I  really  didn’t  mind  one  
way or another.  
‘The  board  have  passed  it,’  Hobley  said.  ‘We’ve  got  a  mechanism  which  will  give  us  precedence  
over your assets in the  retail  operation.’  
I put the phone down, lay back on my hotel bed and shut my eyes. If that article had appeared 
almost  anywhere  else,  the  City’s  reaction  would  have  been  very  different.  It  is  a  frightening  truth,  but  
perception is everything with some of  these bankers. Normally we have been able to use the 
perception of Virgin to our advantage. But for the first time the boot was on the other foot and we 
were fighting to restore confidence. If such an article had appeared in the Financial Times , the banks  
could well have pulled out their loans and brought the Virgin Group crashing down.  
I was in Japan to receive an honorary doctorate. The university had asked me to fly out to meet the 
students and suggested I do a question and answer session rather than a formal speech. As I sat in front 
of a thousand students, the professor asked for questions. There was a deathly hush which lasted for nearly three minutes. To break the ice I said that the first person to ask me a question would get two 
upper -class tickets  to London. Fifty hands shot up. For the next three hours I was kept very busy.  
I was also looking at a possible site for a Virgin Megastore in Kyoto. Mike Inman and I took the 
train  from  Tokyo  to  Kyoto.  This  train  was  called  the  ‘Shinkansen’,  popularly  kn own  as  the  ‘Bullet  
Train’.  It  was  rather  like  being  on  board  a  plane:  there  were  audios  to  listen  to,  steward  service  and  
even vending machines.  
‘Why  can’t  trains  be  like  this  in  the  UK?’  I  wondered.  I  jotted  down  some  notes  about  trains  in  
Britain and tra ins in Japan and then turned my attention to the Megastore site.  
Back  in  London  the  next  week,  Will’s  telephone  rang  on  Friday  evening.  It  was  Toby  Helm,  the  
transport correspondent on the Sunday Telegraph . He asked Will whether Virgin would be interested 
in operating trains if the government privatised British Rail. Will came down to ask me.  
‘Well,  are  we?’  I  asked  back.  
The more we talked, the more sense it made. Railways had to be one of the answers to all the 
traffic problems. Every new motorway was imm ediately clogged up; driving from London to 
Manchester was a nightmare.  
‘Tell  him  that  we  are,’  I  suggested.  ‘It  can’t  do  any  harm.’  
The headline of the Sunday Telegraph  read ‘VIRGIN  TO  GO  INTO  TRAINS’  and explained that 
Virgin wanted to operate the east -coast franchise and do a joint venture with British Rail. It became 
the story of the week – a useful distraction from our cash problems and an excellent counter to all the 
negative publicity we had suffered. It showed us thinking about expanding rather than  worrying about 
our finances. It was a crucial release of pressure for us, and for a while journalists stopped going on 
about our finances and imminent collapse, and started taking an interest in our bold plans for the 
future.  
All kinds of people called us  up on Monday, including Siemens and GEC, and among them was 
someone who introduced himself as Jim Steer from Steer Davies Gleave, transport consultants. Will 
immediately recognised that Jim knew what he was talking about.  
‘You’ve  got  to  follow  this  throug h,’  Jim  told  Will.  ‘I  suggest  that  you  get  together  with  Intercity  
and  offer  a  joint  service  on  the  125s.’  
We  registered  three  possible  trading  names,  ‘Virgin  Rail’,  ‘Virgin  Express’  and  ‘Virgin  Flyer’,  
and  asked  Jim  to  commission  an  artist’s  impression  of  a Virgin train. We warned him that our budget 
was zero, but he went ahead anyway and then put us in touch with a venture -capital firm called Electra 
who he said might put up some seed money to investigate the idea. Will and I went along to Electra 
and met  someone called Rowan Gormley who agreed to put up £20,000 to commission a feasibility 
study.  
Armed with a small business plan and a mock -up of a Virgin train, Trevor, Will and I, together 
with Jim and Rowan Gormley, met Chris Green, the director of Britis h  Rail’s  Intercity  service;;  Roger  
Freeman from the Ministry of Transport; and John Welsby, the chief executive of British Rail. We talked  about  the  possibility  of  Virgin  running  some  railway  services,  but  British  Rail  weren’t  keen.  
John Welsby was against any kind of privatisation and he saw our proposal as the thin end of the 
wedge.  
As he walked out of the meeting, he turned to one of his companions and made a comment which 
was  picked  up  on  the  intercom  and  broadcast  all  over  the  office.  He  said,  ‘I’ll  be   in my grave before 
that  fucker  gets  his  logo  on  my  trains.’  
Throughout the week of 21 October, I stood in for Angela Rippon on her early -morning LBC radio 
show. This was not my ideal job since it entailed getting up at 5a.m. and heading off in the dark to the 
LBC building near Euston. I was in the studio from 6a.m. to 8a.m. and then went home for breakfast.  
The radio -show producer called up Lord King to invite him on the show to debate with me the 
problems which British Airways and Virgin were having and th e sorts of tactics that British Airways 
was employing against us.  
‘Tell  him  we’re  not  prepared  to  lower  our  standards  that  much,’  Lord  King  snapped  at  her.  ‘And  
you  can  quote  me.’  
It was the first time I had approached Lord King since our exchange of letters in January and 
February, but his reply had lost none of its sting. My invitation to Lord King to debate what was going 
on was only half tongue in cheek. The previous week I had been called by Joseph Campbell, who ran 
a limousine service for Virgin Records.  
‘Richard,’  he  said,  ‘I’m  sorry  to  bother  you  but  I  thought  you  should  know  that  something  rather  
sinister has happened. One of the ladies who works for us has a daughter who wo rks for a company of 
private investigators. And she told her mother that the company has just started spying on you. They 
followed you to Claridges last week and sat at the next -door  table.’ 
I flicked back my diary: I had indeed had lunch at Claridges. I t hanked Joseph and wondered 
what to do. Should I call the police? I put the telephone down and looked at it. All my life the 
telephone had been my lifeline. But now I wondered whether anyone was listening in to my calls. I 
wondered whether these private det ectives were following my children to school. Or sifting through 
my dustbins. I wandered over to the window and looked up Holland Park. Perhaps the British Telecom 
van parked there was a fraud and was actually packed with listening devices. Perhaps I had b een 
reading too many spy novels.  
Then  I  pushed  the  thought  out  of  my  mind.  I  couldn’t  change  the  way  I  lived  and  I  had  nothing  to  
hide. If I tried to second -guess these detectives and whoever was employing them, who I was sure had 
to be British Airways, then I would drive myself mad. I co uldn’t  live  like  that.  If  I  started  thinking  that  
I  was  being  continually  followed,  I’d  rapidly  become  paranoid.  I  decided  I  would  carry  on  my  life  as  
normal.  I  wouldn’t  even  stoop  to  their  level  by  having  my  telephone  checked  for  bugs.  
All week I was up a t 5a.m., and by Friday I was feeling rather exhausted. In the middle of the 
afternoon  I  went  back  to  my  office  to  find  a  note  on  my  desk  from  Penni:  ‘Chris  Hutchins  from   Today  
called  about  a  potential  gossip  story.  Wanted  you  to  call  him  back.’  
Chris Hutch ins was a gossip columnist with Today  newspaper who had a known drink problem.  I called him back.  
‘Richard,  first  of  all  I  want  you  to  know  that  I’ve  done  Alcoholics  Anonymous,’  Chris  said.  ‘I’m  
clean,  so  you  can  take  what  I  say  seriously.’  
I began to list en and picked up my notebook.  
‘I’ve  spoken  to  Brian  Basham.’  
‘Who’s  he?’  
‘BA’s  PR  man.  He  is  to  Lord  King  what  Tim  Bell  is  to  Lord  Hanson.  I  know  Basham’s  wife  
Eileen quite well because she used to work for me here. She called me to say that Brian might ha ve a 
good  story  about  Branson  and  drugs.’  
‘Great,’  I  said  sarcastically.  
‘I  called  Basham  up  and  he  told  me  that  he’d  been  doing  a  detailed  study  for  BA  on  Virgin’s  
operations, its strengths and weaknesses. He also mentioned an unsubstantiated story about Heaven 
and  suggested  that  I  check  out  the  drug  position  there  for  myself.  He  said  he  didn’t  particularly  want  
to put you out of business; in fact the last thing BA wanted was to be seen to have your blood on its 
hands.’ 
This struck a chord. I tried to reme mber which other journalists had been asking about Heaven 
and suddenly it came to me: among them was Frank Kane, the financial journalist on the City pages of 
the Sunday Telegraph . 
‘He  then  told  me  that  I  should  also  look  at  the  recent  piece  in  the   Guardia n about your cash 
position.  Well,  finance  isn’t  my  thing  and  I  wasn’t  that  interested.’  
‘Well,  perhaps  you  should  turn  the  tables  on  BA  and  investigate  them,’  I  suggested.  
‘I  could  consider  that,’  Chris  said,  ‘but  it’s  not  really  my  style.  I  just  write  a  g ossip column. 
Anyway,  I’m  having  lunch  with  Brian  Basham  on  Monday  at  the  Savoy.’  
‘Will  you  come  and  see  me  over  the  weekend?’  I  asked.  ‘I’d  love  to  chat  this  through  with  you.’  
‘Sure,’  Chris  said.  
I buzzed the intercom up to Will.  
‘Chris  Hutchins  called  m e.’ 
‘He  was  the  one  in  1989  who  caused  all  that  fuss  by  claiming  you  were  in  for  a  knighthood:  
“ARISE,  SIR  RICHARD” .  REMEMBER?’  Will  said.  
‘He  sounds  like  he’s  cleaned  himself  up.  He  called  me  with  a  story  about  BA  and  their  interest  in  
us.’  I  read  from  my  notes.  ‘Have  you  heard  of  Brian  Bingham?’  ‘No,’  Will  said,  nonplussed.  
‘Well,  he  is  to  Lord  King  what  Tim  Bell  is  to  Lord  Hanson.’  
‘Never  heard  of  him,’  Will  said.  
‘Basham,’  I  corrected.  ‘Brian  Basham,  and  he’s  talking  about  drugs  at  Heaven.’  
‘Brian  Basha m!  Christ!  I’m  coming  down.’  
Will  always  looks  flustered,  as  if  he’s  itching  to  get  on  and  make  the  next  telephone  call,  but  
when he stormed into my room he looked in a flat panic.  
‘Brian  Basham  is  bad  news,’  he  said.  ‘He’s  one  of  the  most  influential  PR  m en in the business. If 
he’s  up  against  us  we’re  in  deep,  deep  shit.  He’s  got  closer  ties  in  Fleet  Street  than  anyone.’  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 26 Barbarians at the departure gate  
October –November 1991  
BRITISH AIRWAYS WAS OBVIOUSLY  gaining access to computer information that should have 
been off limits. It was confirmed when, out of the blue, Peter Fleming from BA wrote a second letter 
in which he detailed a number of things that British Airways had done. Dated 29 October 1991, it 
covered a wider range than his letter from earlier in the year. He started off by repeating how a 
management  task  force  had  been  set  up  to  discredit  the  ‘Branson  image’.  ‘This,  I  felt,’  he  wrote,  
‘would  have  originated  as  a  strategy  at  a  very  senior  level  wi thin BA. I was shocked that the company 
could  be  so  open  about  this  and  state  it  in  such  an  uncompromising  way.’  He  went  on  to  say:  
  
However, not long after when Virgin took some concerns to the European Courts there was a 
noticeable backlash which swept the whole company. At this time I was told to destroy all 
documents that had any references to Virgin, not once but four or five times by different people 
from  managers  to  managers’  secretaries.  Again  I  was  reasonably  shocked  that  BA’s  senior  
management co uld be so concerned about its activities that it felt that all references to an airline 
should be destroyed in this way. I did not destroy anything myself, as I did not feel that my files 
had anything of a damaging nature, but I know that other people in m y department did destroy 
material because of this directive.  
Peter   Fleming   had   already   described   these   two   aspects   of   BA’s   campaign,   but   I   was   still  
surprised to see them set out in black and white. More interesting were the further details he 
highlighted:  ‘The  following  points  are  the  issues  that  I  was  aware  of  in   respect of BA trying to squeeze 
Virgin out of the picture. They do not necessarily constitute anti -competitive behaviour but this is 
something  for  you  to  decide.’  
The list included British Airways deliberately applying for slots to Japan and Australia that  it 
didn’t  need  for  the  sole  purpose  of  stopping  Virgin  getting  them;;  a  special  sales  force  getting  business  
in the Gatwick area and offering low fares from Gatwick to squeeze yields for all airlines there (while 
continuing to operate a high -fare monopoly from Heathrow); refusing to process bookings for 
passengers who had flown from Japan to Gatwick by Virgin and then wanted to switch to BA, so that 
they would have to fly BA all the way; and accessing our booking information by delving into the 
computer res ervations system.  
‘In  my  opinion,’  Fleming  wrote,  ‘BA  lacks  integrity  and  this  stems  right  from  the  top  of  the  
organisation  with  Lord  King,  and  unfortunately  permeates  the  whole  structure.’  
With  Peter  Fleming’s  evidence,  I  now  knew  some  of  what  British  Air ways was doing behind the 
scenes;;  when  I  also  got  hold  of  Chris  Hutchins’  tape  of  his  conversation  with  Brian  Basham  I  also  
knew what they were doing in the press. Although I was caught in this two -pronged attack, at least I 
knew exactly which tactics BA w as using. It was sinister, but I could begin to think about how to 
retaliate.  ‘BRANSON  ATTACKS  BA  “TRICKS ”’  was  the  headline  in  the   Sunday Times  on 3 November 
1991.  This  wasn’t  exactly  what  I  had  in  mind  but  it  was  true  nonetheless.  I’d  been  hoping  that  th e 
Sunday Times  would  stick  their  neck  out  and  say  how  scandalous  they  thought  BA’s  tactics  were  
rather than just repeating my claims, but it was a start. For the first time in the campaign, Brian 
Basham was publicly linked with British Airways, blowing his  cover. Insight reported how Basham 
had given his confidential report to a number of journalists. I was quoted as saying that I had a list of 
one hundred complaints which I would take to the European Commission unless British Airways 
stopped their dirty tr icks. And Nick Rufford made no mention of the cash -for-fuel story which had 
started his investigation.  
 
 
27 ‘They’re  calling  me  a  liar.’  
November 1991 –March 1992  
‘RICHARD  YOU’RE  NOT  GONNA  believe  this  about  BA,’  Ronnie  Thomas  told  me.  
‘Try  me,’  I  said.  ‘At  t his  particular  moment  I’m  prepared  to  believe  almost  anything.’  
Ronnie Thomas runs his own limousine company in New York. Twenty years ago he started out 
as a regular cab driver in Manhattan and slowly saved enough money to trade in his clapped -out 
yellow cab for a smart limousine, which he offered as a chauffeur -driven service specialising in 
collecting  and  dropping  off  passengers  at  New  York’s  two  airports.  By  the  time  I  met  him  in  1986  he  
had a successful limousine service with over 200 cars. He had call ed me as soon as he read that Virgin 
Atlantic was going to offer a limousine service to all upper -class passengers, and he pitched for the 
entire account. He won it, and over the years Ronnie has never let us down.  
In the previous few days he and his drive rs had been finding that, when they dropped passengers 
off  at  the  kerb,  British  Airways  staff  were  meeting  them  and  offering  them  ‘incentives’  to  fly  BA  
instead of Virgin. Ronnie had had a flaming argument with them, and later got a call from BA banning 
him  from  BA’s  own  terminal  at  JFK.  
‘Have  you  ever  come  across  anything  like  this  before?’  I  asked  Ronnie.  
‘No,  man,’  he  said.  ‘I  thought  that  American  carriers  weren’t  exactly  gentlemen,  but  this  is  
another  ball  game  altogether.’  
I had no idea whether this w as illegal or not, but it was certainly the most blatant attempt yet to 
poach our passengers.  
After the Sunday Times  had  exposed  some  of  British  Airways’  tactics,  the  next  paper  to  follow  
was the Guardian , with a front -page headline: ‘BA  UNDER  FIRE  FOR  VIR GIN  CAMPAIGN’ . 
There was a full -page  analysis  of  British  Airways’  tactics  entitled   ‘VIRGIN’S  COMPLAINT  TO  EC  
CASTS  MORE  DOUBT  ON  BA’S  PRACTICES’ . In spite of the articles, the dirty tricks carried on. No matter how many accurate press stories 
were publishe d, British Airways had always been immune to criticism. To the world at large, they 
shrugged  off  my  allegations  as  the  hysterical  overreaction  of  a  man  who  couldn’t  take  competition.  
Their arrogance was overwhelming. As it became clear that British Airways  was intent on seeing the 
back of us, I knew that I had to fight back even harder. In mounting desperation, I began to look for 
any legal action that we could take against British Airways.  
‘It  would  amount  to  an  anti -trust  case  in  America,’  Gerrard  conclud ed  when  we’d  finished  going  
through  what  BA  was  up  to.  ‘But  there’s  no  equivalent  legislation  here.’  
There is a surprising lack of legislation governing competition in the British aviation industry. 
The Monopolies Commission and the Office of Fair Trading had no jurisdiction over BA in this 
instance, since they could investigate only an airline merger, and the CAA had little jurisdiction 
beyond the safety angles involved in servicing aircraft and supervising the prices of air tickets. 
Although BA was a priv atised monopoly like British Telecom, there was no government watchdog 
like Oftel to supervise it. We had lodged a complaint with the European Court, but although there 
were some grounds for this court to rule against BA under Article 85 of the Treaty of R ome, which 
deals with the principles of fair competition, in practice it lacked the teeth to enforce any request that 
might make a company change its business tactics. In effect, our list of complaints to the European 
Court was useful only as a publicity e xercise.  
I  didn’t  want  to  take  British  Airways  to  court.  I  knew  that  it  would  be  expensive  and  risky,  and  
that they would employ a top -flight team of lawyers to try to overwhelm us and the jury with the great 
weight of statistics that a vast airline can mu ster. I simply wanted the dirty tricks to stop and, as I cast 
about for other ways in which to persuade British Airways to call off their campaign, I thought of the 
nonexecutive directors. Since I had already written to Lord King without success, I hoped t hat the 
nonexecutive directors of British Airways might be more impartial. If I asked them to investigate what 
was going on in their company, then in principle they would have to take that request seriously. A 
nonexecutive company director has the same leg al responsibilities as an executive director, but they 
typically  look  after  the  shareholders’  interests  if  there  is  a  conflict  between  the  directors  and  the  
shareholders. As British Airways was now being accused of behaviour that could create such a 
confli ct, and accused by the press as well as by Virgin Atlantic, the shareholders deserved an 
explanation of what their company directors were doing.  
The British Airways nonexecutive directors comprised Sir Michael Angus (a director of Thorn 
EMI at the time and  formerly chairman of Unilever), Lord White (who ran Hanson Trust with Lord 
Hanson), the Honourable Charles Price, Sir Francis Kennedy, and Michael Davis. Their names read 
like a Debrett of business. The letter took me over a week to compose, and set out e verything we knew 
about what British Airways was up to. On 11 December 1991, I eventually signed and sent off an 
eleven -page document which outlined the facts and concluded:  
  
I have found it hard to believe that a major public company like BA could be beh ind the sort of 
conduct identified in this letter whose primary purpose can only be the discrediting of a 
competitor and the damaging of its business. I am writing to you because I doubt whether you 
would want a company of which you are a director to condu ct itself in such a way and in the hope that the directors of BA would wish to be absolutely and unequivocally disassociated from any 
such activities because they would agree that it was not the proper way to run a business.  
I would like you to investigate the matters raised in this letter, provide detailed responses 
and give me your assurance that you will ensure that the conduct revealed to you on investigation 
or any similar conduct is stopped and never again repeated.  
I would  have  thought  that  British  Airways’  experience  of  trying  to  eliminate  the  competitive  
threat posed by Laker Airways was sufficient deterrent against trying to do the same to others. I 
am sure you remember the impact upon BA of its actions towards Laker Airways.  BA’s  
privatisation plans were disrupted; the directors in the United States were threatened with 
criminal prosecution; there was a huge waste of management time; BA attracted considerable 
adverse publicity; millions of dollars were spent in legal expenses and BA made the biggest 
single contribution to the massive legal settlement fund.  
I attached an eight -page appendix which covered all the details I knew, and divided the dirty 
tricks into six sections: the press campaign, spoiling tactics, enginee ring matters, sales and marketing, 
dirty tricks, and private investigators(?). I put a question mark on the final category since I still found 
it  impossible  to  believe,  and  wrote,  ‘Bizarre  incidents  have  been  taking  place  recently  more  suitable  
for an epis ode of Dick Tracy  than  the  airline  industry.’  I  related  the  snippets  I’d  picked  up  and  asked,  
‘Can  you  shed  any  light  on  any  of  these  incidents?  I  cannot  believe  that  a  major  public  company  like  
British  Airways  is  behind  this  sort  of  conduct.’  
As the lette r was sent, I had no idea what reaction to expect. I did not wish to sue British 
Airways. There was enough to do without having to spend eighteen hours a day fighting British 
Airways. I was acutely aware that I was having to ignore all the other businesses  within the Virgin 
Group as we fought this battle.  
I  wondered  whether  the  nonexecutive  directors  would  assume  that  I  couldn’t  compete  with  
Freddie  Laker’s  court  case,  which  had  produced  over  a  million  legal  documents.  Sir  Freddie  had  sued  
British Airways o nly after he had gone bust and had time to devote all his energy to the lawsuit. But, 
by then, of course, BA had accomplished their task. The court case may have delayed their 
privatisation and forced them to pay £10 million compensation, but this was noth ing compared with 
the  profits  they  made  on  the  transatlantic  route  by  hiking  prices  as  soon  as  Laker’s  planes  were  
grounded. I was trying to stop British Airways while simultaneously running the airline, but BA might 
not back off until Virgin was grounded too. 
Whatever their reaction, I felt sure that the nonexecutive directors could not ignore the eight -page 
attachment  which  detailed  their  company’s  dirty  tricks.  Since  they  were  also  responsible  to  their  
shareholders, we released copies of this letter to t he press to ensure that their shareholders would have 
the chance to read it too.  
To my amazement, I received a reply from both Sir Colin Marshall and Sir Michael Angus the 
very  next  day.  Sir  Michael  Angus  wrote  a  disclaimer  saying  that  it  would  be  ‘wholly   inappropriate for 
the nonexecutive directors of a public company to report to a third party in the manner that you 
request’,  and  concluded  that  ‘the  proper  course  of  action  is  for  any  such  allegation  to  be  directed  to  the  
board  as  a  whole’.  Sir Colin Marsh all’s  answer  was  equally  patronising.  His  letter  flatly  denied  that  British  Airways  
was  involved  in  a  deliberate  attempt  to  damage  Virgin  or  sought  ‘to  compete  other  than  through  
normal  marketing  and  promotional  efforts’.  He  suggested  that  our  ‘allegations ’  were  made  to  gain  
publicity,  and  that  I  should  devote  my  ‘undoubted  energies  to  more  constructive  purposes’.  
Given the time these two directors had taken to respond to my letter, they could not have begun 
to investigate any of its contents.  
I replied to Sir Colin Marshall on 16 December 1991 and urged him to reconsider his dismissive 
attitude to my allegations. I did not accuse him of masterminding the dirty tricks or even condoning 
them, but merely asked him to look at the facts. I wanted to give him eve ry chance to put a stop to 
what was going on. I wrote:  
  
I had always hoped that you personally had no knowledge of the worst that had been going on at 
British  Airways.  However,  having  read  your  response  to  my  letter  I’m  no  longer  sure,  for  your  
letter con tinues the lies that we at Virgin have had to contend with. The allegations are certainly 
not  ‘unjustified’.  In  fact  many  of  them  are  not  our  allegations  but  matters  that  first  came  to  our  
attention from reports in the Sunday Times  and the Guardian . I notice that you have written to 
neither paper refuting them. They also came to our attention from Virgin passengers who were 
shocked that BA could get their home phone numbers and offer them incentives to cancel their 
firm Virgin tickets and switch to BA…  How  can  you  dismiss  them  out  of  hand  without  any  
inquiry? I ask you to take the matters raised seriously and respond to my letter point by point. We 
can then get on to competing in a fair manner.  
But Sir Colin Marshall wrote straight back as if he had barely  bothered  to  read  my  letter:  ‘I  see  
nothing  to  be  gained  from  further  correspondence.’  
For  a  time  afterward  it  looked  as  if  British  Airways’  version  of  events  was  gaining  ground.  Sir  
Colin Marshall was quoted everywhere saying that my allegations wer e  ‘utterly  without  foundation’  
and, although he never said that Marcia Borne or Ronnie Thomas were figments of my imagination, 
people outside Virgin could have been forgiven for assuming that there was an element of truth in 
BA’s  denial.  
My allegations aga inst British Airways had passed the point of no return. Unless British Airways 
apologised and put an end to their dirty tricks, I would have to follow up my open letter to the 
nonexecutive directors with some kind of legal action. The difficulty was findin g the appropriate 
grounds upon which to sue.  
The row between us had one immediate casualty that I should have foreseen: Virgin Atlantic was 
completely unable to raise any money. Salomons, our American investment bank, were trying to raise 
£20 million of ca pital by privately offering some of the equity for sale. But, in exactly the same way 
as it had been impossible to sell equity in British Airways while the Laker court case dragged on, so 
nobody would touch Virgin Atlantic while it looked as if we would go  to court against BA. And we 
were still losing money. While we had been frantically busy trying to piece together what British Airways was up to, our consortium of lending banks had continued to watch the cash flow. And in the 
depths of winter the numbers looked much worse.  
I  realised  that,  to  this  extent,  I’d  played  straight  into  British  Airways’  hands.  One  of  their  
objectives was to stop me expanding Virgin Atlantic, and the only way I could do that was by 
refinancing the airline. The louder I complained about their dirty tricks, the less any other airline, 
venture -capital house, or other investor wanted to invest in Virgin Atlantic. Outsiders probably 
thought that there was no smoke without fire. We lost both ways: nobody wanted to invest in a small 
airline if it was being squeezed out by a vast organisation like British Airways; and nobody wanted to 
invest  in  an  airline  that  might  embark  on  lengthy  and  expensive  litigation  against  one  of  the  world’s  
largest airlines.  
Without funds forthcoming from the Cit y, Virgin Atlantic continued to be starved of capital. By 
Christmas 1991 Virgin Atlantic was ploughing through the difficult winter months and losing money. 
Our six main lending banks continued to write to Trevor reminding us that our loans were due to be 
repaid next April, and Lloyds Bank, which was our clearing bank and so saw wide fluctuations as 
money came in and went out, grew increasingly anxious. Perhaps British Airways gambled that, even 
if we did announce a legal action, they could spin it out long  enough so that we would go bust in the 
meantime. Even after my letter of 11 December, British Airways was brazen and laughed off my 
allegations.  
For once I did not know what to do. I spent a lot of time thinking and became very quiet. Will 
went the opposi te way and spent all day in a fury about British Airways, shouting and ranting in his 
frustration at not being able to land a proper punch on them.  
On 21 December a letter arrived from Lloyds Bank which heightened the sense that we were 
under siege. It rem inded us that we had recently exceeded our £55 million overdraft facility, and spelt 
out that the bank had allowed the excess only because the money had been needed to pay salaries and 
because IATA had confirmed that £7.5 million was due into our account t he following day. We were 
warned  that  the  bank  might  not  ‘respond  favourably  to  another  request  to  break  the  £55  million  limit’.  
It  finished  by  wishing  us  a  happy  Christmas  and  ‘a  less  stressful  New  Year’.  
If that £7.5 million had been delayed by a week Ll oyds might well have bounced our salary 
cheques.  If  Virgin  Atlantic  went  bust,  I  couldn’t  even  be  sure  that  Virgin  Music  would  remain  intact.  I  
doubted  that  Janet  Jackson  or  Phil  Collins  would  be  impressed  by  the  airline’s  collapse.  
As we talked about wher e we could find sufficient funding to replace some of the bank debt, it 
became increasingly clear that we had to find some radical solution rather than always arguing with 
banks over small amounts of increased debt. Virgin Music was our only seriously prof itable business, 
and it was our only chance to save the airline. With the weight of bad publicity caused by BA hanging 
over  us,  we  couldn’t  sell  Virgin  Atlantic  as  a  going  concern,  but  we  could  sell  Virgin  Music  as  one.  
Selling Virgin Music would save the airline and leave two strong companies. Closing down Virgin 
Atlantic would leave one strong company and one bust company, with 2,500 redundancies and the 
Virgin  Group’s  reputation  as  a  company  and  a  brand  name  in  tatters.  
I called up John Thornton, who was  still talking to several companies that were interested in 
acquiring Virgin Music. I had watched his progress with a growing sense of foreboding, unable either to feel any enthusiasm for it or be able to stop it. John told me that Thorn EMI was now offeri ng £425 
million upfront with an earn -out starting from the second year. This was still below the level at which 
David Geffen had sold his record label to MCA. In March 1990 he had sold his record company for 
$520 million, which then represented 2.6 times a nnual sales. On a similar multiple, Virgin Music was 
worth 2.6 times our sales of £330 million – over £850 million.  
Throughout January 1992, Lloyds increased their pressure on us to reduce our overdraft. John Hobley 
from Lloyds toughened his stance conside rably. Since we had mentioned the possible sale of Virgin 
Music  a  year  ago,  that  was  all  he  wanted  to  hear  about:  Why  wasn’t  there  more  progress?  Could  they  
talk  to  Goldman  Sachs  themselves?  From  their  point  of  view,  if  the  sale  didn’t  happen  then  Virgin  
Music would remain a collection of music contracts – intangible  assets.  They  couldn’t  understand  why  
there was such a long delay. Was there something wrong with Virgin Music? Had the bidders walked 
away? Was the company really worth the $1 billion we had ai rily mentioned? Their patience was 
wearing thin, and they wanted to see their loans to Virgin returned to their vaults as real cash. One of 
our problems was that a large amount of our debt was due to be repaid in April, and Trevor and I felt 
doubtful that we could persuade the bank to roll these loans over to a later date.  
The  bank’s  correspondence  reminded  me  of  some  of  the  letters  I  had  received  from  Coutts  when  
they were losing their nerve about their client with shoulder -length hair who had padded baref oot into 
their offices to discuss a loan to buy a manor in Oxfordshire. My hair was now shorter and Virgin was 
bigger, but the bank remained uneasy. Although we had never failed to make a payment, they had 
other clients collapsing on them and they were con cerned.  
The investment atmosphere of early January is summed up by this stock -market report:  
  
Attention  is  now  focusing  on  Lonrho’s  debt  mountain  and  the  attitude  of  its  principal  lenders,  
Lloyds,  Standard  Chartered,  Barclays  and  Nat  West.  Lonrho’s  direct or, Paul Spicer, insists 
Lonrho’s  relationships  with  its  bankers  are  ‘in  good  order’  and  the  group  ‘is  under  no  pressure  
from  them’.  But,  after  the  debt  debacles  at  Polly  Peck,  Brent  Walker  and  Maxwell,  there  is  hardly  
a banker in London who lives comforta bly these days with large lines of credit to entrepreneurial 
companies  driven  by  a  powerful  individual.  Rightly  or  not,  Rowland  is  being  squeezed  by  ‘the  
tycoon  factor’;;  and  his  position  is  made  worse  by  the  recession,  which  had  slashed  the  value  of  
Lonrho ’s  assets  at  a  time  when  the  company  must  sell  businesses  to  raise  cash.  The  old  maestro  
has escaped from tight corners before, and nobody can say that he will not do so again. This time 
however the pressure is really on.  
The ingredients of the story looked ominously similar to ours.  
As Lloyds saw their money at risk to an entrepreneurial company, John Hobley made one more 
effort to control our overdraft. In a letter dated 3 January, he pointed out that our overdraft had 
continued  to  rise  and  that  Lloyds  was  ‘not  in  a  position  to  fund  this  outflow’.  It  was  clear  that  Lloyds  
expected us to sell Virgin Music within the month. John reminded us that our overdraft had to be paid 
off in full by the end of the month and that in the  meantime we could not extend our overdraft facility 
again. He expressed surprise that we had even considered holding on to Virgin Music in the hope of a 
better  offer  than  Thorn  EMI’s.  This was as bad as the Coutts crisis in 1984. Even then we had time and  were able to see some 
other banks to form a syndicate. But January 1992 was as bad a month for bankers and airlines as 
January 1991 had been, when Air Europe and Dan Air went under. All the bankers were in a tailspin 
and it was difficult to remain calm.  
We owed £55 million to Lloyds. As we headed into February and March the airline would need 
cash funding of a further £30 million. The winter months are the most expensive since we have to pay 
for all the major aircraft maintenance at the same time as the nu mber of passengers drops off. So much 
for the unsecured debt. Looking at the cash coming in, we knew that Virgin Music had sales of £330 
million that year, making operating profits of £38 million; next year we were forecasting sales of £400 
million with op erating profits of £75 million. But Lloyds were not willing to wait. I could see that 
something had to give.  
A second Thames Television programme about the battle between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic 
was due to be broadcast at the end of February. T his  time  it  was  Thames  Television’s  flagship  national  
current -affairs programme, This Week . Will and I had first met the producer, Martyn Gregory, at the 
beginning of January, when he had come to see us about the documentary. We had told him as much 
as we could about British Airways, and then left him to carry out his own independent research. 
Martyn had spoken to Peter Fleming, along with various other ex -British Airways staff whom we had 
not come across, and had managed to verify many of my accusations of  BA’s  dirty  tricks.  British  
Airways refused to participate in the programme and their legal director, Mervyn Walker, wrote to 
Martyn  Gregory  and  accused  him  of  falling  ‘into  the  trap  of  being  used  as  a  vehicle  for  Richard  
Branson’s  propaganda’.  Nothing  cou ld have been guaranteed to infuriate an independent television 
producer more.  
I was in two minds about the programme. I could see that by showing people all the dirty tricks 
we were up against they might have two responses. One possible response was that t hey would be able 
to see our vulnerability and thus might back away from Virgin Atlantic as a likely loser. Just the 
words  ‘A  plane  will  fall  out  of  the  sky’,  even  if  they  were  spoken  by  Brian  Basham,  who  was  working  
for British Airways, might remain in pe ople’s  minds  and  worry  them  about  flying  Virgin  Atlantic.  
But, equally, the public might rally round and support us as the underdog. This was my main hope. 
Gerrard  also  pointed  out  that,  since  the  television  audience  is  so  wide,  it  might  jolt  some  people’s  
memories and prompt them to telephone Virgin Atlantic and tell other stories that would help us as we 
compiled all our evidence against British Airways. I organised thirty salespeople to sit at the 
switchboard of our sales office in Crawley on Thursday 27  February in case anyone telephoned us.  
The This Week  film,  ‘Violating  Virgin?’,  opened  with  a  bird’s -eye view of all the mothballed 
planes lined up in the Mojave Desert, which is like an aeroplane morgue where the planes are parked 
in the dry air so that they will not rust. They are drained of their oil, stripped of some of their parts, 
and then their engines and valves are sealed with silver foil. Over this haunting picture came the 
narrator’s  voice:  
‘Virgin  Airways  is  crying  “Rape!”  and  Richard  Branson  c laims that British Airways is putting 
him  out  of  business.’  
‘There’s  fair  competition  and  unfair  competition,’  I  said  to  the  interviewer.  ‘And  I  can’t  believe  
that  British  Airways  is  resorting  to  these  dirty  tricks.’  The documentary interviewed Peter Flemi ng, with his face completely concealed and his voice 
distorted, as he described the special unit British Airways had set up to discredit me, and the mass 
document shredding which had taken place. A similarly concealed American witness described how 
BA had shredded documents relating to Virgin in the USA. In New York, Ronnie Thomas told the 
story of BA buttonholing Virgin passengers as they were dropped off by his limousines, and a Los 
Angeles travel agent described how passengers were switching to BA since they had heard that Virgin 
was about to go bust. Then, with subtitles to spell out what he was saying, we heard Brian Basham 
telling  Chris  Hutchins  that  Virgin  was  a  ‘dicky  business   – just  dicky’.  Sir  Freddie  Laker  repeated  his  
advice to sue the bastards.  
Thames Television interviewed me standing next to one of the Tristars in the Mojave Desert. I 
was dwarfed by a line of over twenty PanAm planes spanning almost a mile. I stood underneath one of 
the seven marooned British Airways planes. It was odd to think  that my entire fleet consisted of only 
eight aircraft.  
‘I  know  a  lot  of  these  stories  come  from  Brian  Basham,  who’s  employed  by  British  Airways,  and  
Brian Basham reports to a man called David Burnside, who is the head PR person at British Airways, 
who the n  reports  to  Lord  King,’  I  said.  ‘I’ve  never  sued  anyone  in  court  for  anything.  We’ve  probably  
got  a  good  case  to  say  that  someone’s  tried  to  damage  our  business,  but  you  know  it  takes  hours  of  
management time. I think our best bet is to get it out into th e  open  and  hopefully  there’ll  be  people  at  
BA  who’ll  realise  it’s  counterproductive,  and  that  they  should  not  carry  on  in  the  future  behaving  in  
this  kind  of  way.’  
British Airways staff were doorstepped by This Week .   Dick   Eberhart,   one   of   BA’s   vice  
preside nts, was confronted in New York, and David Burnside outside his London home in Chelsea. 
Both men refused to answer any questions. The final shots of the documentary were aerial views of 
the dead aeroplanes stretching across the desert, gleaming impotently in the Californian sunshine, just 
where BA would like to see the Virgin fleet.  
‘Perhaps  it’s  time  for  Richard  Branson  to  put  up  or  shut  up,’  said  the  final  voice -over,  ‘or  Virgin  
Atlantic’s  planes  could  end  up  like  Laker’s:  in  the  desert  sand.’  
‘Violating   Virgin?’  was  seen  by  over  7  million  viewers  and  that  evening  the  Virgin  switchboard  
received over 400 calls. Most of the callers just wished us well and said that they would never fly BA 
again, but among all the well -wishers were many people who said that they too had stories to tell of 
being approached by British Airways at the airport as they tried to check into Virgin. And then we hit 
the jackpot.  
On  6  February  Yvonne  Parsons  was  at  home  when  someone  purporting  to  be  from  Virgin’s  
reservations department  called  her  to  say  that  her  flight  was  overbooked.  Since  she  hadn’t  been  issued  
with a ticket, would she mind changing to a British Airways flight? This was the last straw. Yvonne 
Parsons had flown to and from the States four times in the last eight months , and each time there had 
been  an  alleged  ‘booking  error’  with  Virgin.  The  previous  October,  Parsons  had  been  called  in  her  
New  York  office  by  a  ‘Virgin  representative’  who  gave  her  name  as  ‘Mary  Ann’  and  told  her  that  her  
Virgin flight was overbooked and,  to compensate for the inconvenience, she could fly – at no extra 
cost – the following day on Concorde. Parsons refused. She flew to and from New York and London 
regularly, and she preferred Virgin – once she got on to the plane. She was a valuable custome r, and she was rather surprised that Virgin was being so casual about her. She asked to be wait -listed for her 
flight and asked Mary Ann to call her the next day to let her know whether she was on or not.  
As  with  ‘Bonnie’  from  Virgin  in  August,  who  had  tol d her that the flight was delayed, and 
‘Larry’  from  Virgin  in  September,  who  said  that  all  nonsmoking  seats  were  full,  Mary  Ann  failed  to  
call Yvonne Parsons back. So Parsons called up Virgin reservations and asked to speak to Mary Ann.  
‘There’s  no  Mary  An n  here,’  she  was  told.  
‘Then  who  called  me  yesterday  and  said  that  I  was  bounced  off  the  16th  of  October  flight?’  
Parsons asked.  
‘The  16th  of  October?  No,  you’re  confirmed  on  that  flight,  nonsmoking.’  
Yvonne Parsons was baffled. She was also furious with V irgin and switched to American 
Airlines and United for her flights for the rest of the year. When she decided to give Virgin one last try 
in  February,  she  couldn’t  believe  it  when  another  member  of  the  Virgin  reservations  staff  called  her  to  
tell her that the flight was overbooked and would she mind flying British Airways.  
Then  she  watched  ‘Violating  Virgin?’  The  next  day  she  called  up  Virgin  and  was  put  through  to  
our lawyers. She told her story to Gerrard.  
‘As  I  watched  the  programme,’  she  told  him,  ‘it  s uddenly dawned on me that I must have been 
the  victim  of  an  elaborate  and  disgraceful  deception  by  British  Airways.  I’d  always  been  offered  
flights on British Airways, never on other airlines. I wondered whether these people were British 
Airways staff impe rsonating  Virgin.’  
‘We’ve  got  an  amazing  statement,’  Gerrard  told  me  after  taking  down  this  story.  ‘We  could  build  
a  court  case  around  her  alone.’  
To  drive  the  point  home,  I  wrote  to  Sir  Colin  Marshall  the  day  after  ‘Violating  Virgin?’,  28  
February 1992, and asked him to reconsider my letter to the nonexecutives of 11 December 1991. I 
pointed out:  
  
Given the haste of your reply, I take it that you d id not have sufficient time within which to 
investigate the matter. There have been numerous further independent reports in the media on 
this subject which have all supported the complaints that Virgin have made, culminating in the 
broadcast on ITV last ni ght of the This Week  television documentary. This Week  have 
independently uncovered many more facts which go to prove that our allegations are totally 
correct. The content of the programme speaks for itself and in fact confirmed that the problem is 
even mo re serious and deep -rooted than we originally thought. The least your shareholders can 
now expect is a full and proper explanation as to what exactly has been going on within British 
Airways and of the activities of Mr Brian Basham and those to whom he rep orts at British 
Airways.  
I asked him directly whether he would now intervene:    
I should now like from you in your role as deputy chairman and chief executive of British 
Airways a clear assurance that you will make certain that the activities that have been highlighted 
will immediately cease and that you will give a clear apology.  
Well,  I  thought,  it  wasn’t  too  late   – just.  But  he’d  better  make  sure  that  his  apology  was  a  good  
one. 
I was up in Kidlington on Friday when Will rang me.  
‘Richard,’  Will  said.  ‘I’m  in  a  call  box.  I’ve  just  landed  at  Gatwick  and  I’ve  picked  up  a  copy  of  
BA Ne ws. The front -page headline says, “BRANSON  ‘DIRTY  TRICKS’  CLAIM  UNFOUNDED” . 
They’re  calling  you  a  liar.’  
Will had been on a skiing holiday when the programme was broadcast. The dates of both the 
programme and his skiing holiday had been changed several tim es  so  that  they  didn’t  coincide,  but  as  
luck would have it they still did. Since so many people were calling us, I had asked Will to come back 
to manage the PR storm which was brewing. In response he had just landed at Gatwick.  
The BA News  article went on to say:  
  
Thames  TV’s  current -affairs programme This Week  last night devoted its programme to Richard 
Branson’s  allegations  of  ‘dirty  tricks’  by  British  Airways  against  Virgin.  British  Airways  was  
invited to take part but declined after careful considerati on  for  reasons  explained  to  Thames’s  
producer Martyn Gregory in full in a letter from Mervyn Walker, legal director.  
The rest of the article reproduced the letter from Mervyn Walker which accused Thames 
Television of falling into my publicity trap and said  that  BA  would  not  be  ‘provoked  into  playing  Mr  
Branson’s  futile  game  and  must  therefore  decline  to  take  part’.  
‘What  a  load  of  bollocks!’  we  said  together.  ‘They’re  calling  me  a  liar  and  this  is  libel.’  
It was the last straw. Will faxed me the article fro m Holland Park. We tracked down Gerrard, 
who immediately agreed that they had libelled me. Suing BA for libel would be a far easier case to 
bring to court and make clear to a jury than a highly complicated case about BA abusing its 
monopolistic position at  Heathrow. It would also push everything out into the open.  
On Monday morning I discovered that Lord King had written personal letters back to any viewers 
who  had  written  in  to  question  him  about  British  Airways’  dirty  tricks,  and  he’d  assured  them  that  
there was no truth whatsoever in my allegations. In effect, it was the same libel repeated, and once 
again to members of the public. I decided that I should sue Lord King as well.  
That morning, I also received a letter from Sir Colin Marshall. He called my a ccusations 
‘unjustified’,  said  he  had  nothing  to  add  to  his  previous  letters  to  me,  and  asserted  that  the  allegation  
of  a  ‘dirty  tricks’  campaign  was  ‘wholly  without  foundation’.  I stared with amazement at the letter. Perhaps Sir Colin Marshall had been un able to watch 
‘Violating  Virgin?’  Perhaps  he  had  been  stuck  in  a  traffic  jam  or  on  board  a  delayed  flight.  Perhaps  he  
remained blithely unaware of what was going on in his company. If so, it seemed very odd: by 
reputation Sir Colin Marshall was a workaholi c, a man who was obsessed with detail, who knew every 
single thing that went on in any of the companies where he worked.  
The next week the sale of Virgin Music finally overtook me.  
 
 
28 Victory  
March 1992 –January 1993  
THERE WAS £560 MILLION  – $1 billion – on the  table,  but  I  didn’t  want  it.  
‘They  need  to  know  by  2p.m.  this  afternoon,’  John  Thornton  told  me.  I  rang  off  and  looked  
across at Simon and Ken. We had spent the last twenty years building up the company but nothing had 
prepared us for selling it.  
In m any ways the signing of The Rolling Stones was the culmination of everything I had ever 
wanted to do at Virgin Music. We had been fighting to sign them for twenty years, and now at last we 
had the greatest rock and roll band in the world on our label. From  being a start -up label back in 1973 
that had relied on the genius of Mike Oldfield, we had now come of age: now we were the label of 
choice  for  many  of  the  world’s  biggest  bands.  Artists  had  seen  how  we  had  launched  Phil  Collins’  solo  
career, and how we p romoted UB40 and Simple Minds, what we had been able to do with Culture 
Club and Peter Gabriel, and they wanted to sign with us. But, just as we reached this height, it was 
over. 
‘Ken?’  I  asked.  
‘It’s  your  call,’  he  said.  
‘Simon?’ 
‘Take  the  cash.  You’ve  go t  no  option.’  
Whenever  anyone  tells  me  that  I’ve  got  no  option,  I  try  to  prove  them  wrong.  Over  the  last  few  
days  Thorn  EMI’s  offer  had  changed  from  an  all -share offer, which would have left me as the largest 
shareholder in Thorn EMI with 14 per cent, or a  lower cash alternative, to a higher cash offer. Even 
though Thorn had now switched tactics and was offering more cash than shares, I was more attracted 
to the share exchange since it would mean that I could keep a stake in Thorn EMI which I might use in 
the future as the basis to bid for the company. The difficulty was that everyone told me it would be too 
risky to use this stake as security to borrow any more money to support Virgin Atlantic. Shares in 
Thorn EMI were not seen as a cast -iron security. Alth ough I had already drafted a letter to the staff explaining that I was going to take up Thorn EMI shares and so keep an interest in the company, I 
reluctantly had to change my mind and go for the cash offer.  
Before finally agreeing, I called up Peter Gabriel and broke the news to him. I wanted his advice, 
and I was also aware that the sale would affect his career.  
‘Don’t  do  it,  Richard,’  he  said.  ‘You’ll  wake  up  one  night  in  a  cold  sweat  and  wish  that  you’d  
never  done  it.  You’ll  never  get  it  back  again.’  
I knew that he was right. It was exactly what Joan had been saying. But the pressure from BA 
was too great. By now I felt so sure that Lloyds was going to foreclose on us that I had no alternative. 
I was also a ware that Simon wanted to sell, and that he wanted to take cash rather than prolong his 
involvement with the Group by taking shares. If taking shares in Thorn EMI would prolong the agony 
at Virgin Atlantic, then it would defeat the whole point of the exerc ise. My overriding objective was to 
save Virgin Atlantic from going under, and – cruelly – the only reason I was selling Virgin Music was 
because it was so successful. If I sold Virgin Music, the Virgin name would be saved. Rather than 
having one strugglin g airline and a record company, there would be a secure airline and a secure 
record company, albeit owned by Thorn EMI. And, although I knew that Simon would leave it, I 
could stay on as president of the company. Most importantly, Ken was going to remain i n charge of 
Virgin within Thorn, and he would safeguard the Virgin reputation.  
I  called  up  Trevor,  who  confirmed  the  bank’s  line:  
‘Cash  is  the  only  choice,’  he  told  me.  ‘It  means  that  we  can  pay  back  all  the  debt  and  start  afresh.  
It’ll  give  you  complete  f reedom. And, when thinking about Thorn shares, remember what happened in 
the stock -market  crash.’  
That made up my mind. If I took Thorn shares and they fell dramatically in value, I could be 
powerless to stop the bank moving in. Sir Freddie Laker had remin ded me how it happens so fast that 
it takes your breath away. Rather like Virgin, his airline had fought a long battle against British 
Airways and, just when he needed their support, the banks pulled in their loans. He was invited in to 
see the banks, expe cting them to agree to a small increase in his overdraft on the back of an expected 
boom the following year, but when he arrived he was shown into a side room. Nobody came to see 
him for thirty minutes. Finally, he managed to get hold of the bank director,  who then invited him up 
to another room. One look at their faces as he walked in made him realise that something terrible had 
happened.  
‘We’ve  put  Laker  Airways  into  receivership,’  they  told  him.  
It was all over. There was nothing Sir Freddie could do to prevent the receivers from sacking all 
the staff, changing the locks on the buildings, confiscating all company property, leaving passengers 
stranded and handing the planes back. The Laker check -in desks at Gatwick vanished overnight and 
the   sales   desk   stopped   taking   bookings.   The   telephones   were   unplugged   and   a   lifetime’s   work  
disappeared  in  six  hours.  It  was  Sir  Freddie’s  experience  which  more  than  anything  else  made  me  hold  
back from pushing the banks too far. Once I let them take control, Virgin Atlantic would be finished. 
It would be scant consolation to know that $1 billion had once been on the table.  Obstinate  as  I  am,  I  recognised  that  there  is  a  time  to  back  down.  ‘Live  for  the  present   –’  I  heard 
my  parents’  old  maxim  in  the  back  of  my  head  ‘ – and  the  future  will  look  after  itself.’  My  instinct  for  
continued involvement with Virgin Music and taking Thorn EMI shares was tempered by the need for 
financial security. John Thornton, who was advoca ting that I should take the shares, did not know the 
whole  picture;;  nor  did  Peter  Gabriel,  who  was  arguing  that  I  shouldn’t  do  it  at  all.  And  so,  pushing  
Virgin Music into the past tense, I picked up the phone and called John Thornton at Goldman Sachs.  
‘I’ll  take  the  cash,’  I  heard  myself  say.  ‘I’ll  leave  the  rest  to  you.’  
‘Fine,’  he  said.  ‘The  lawyers  are  on  their  last  round  now.  I’ll  call  you  when  it’s  time  to  come  
over.’ 
Although I had saved the airline, I felt that I had killed something inside me. Look ing at Simon 
and Ken, I was saddened that we would each go in separate directions. In some ways I was happiest 
for Ken: he was going to stay with Virgin within EMI, and would soon be releasing records by Janet 
Jackson and The Rolling Stones. I had no idea what Simon would do, but I suspected that he would 
enjoy a quieter life. I knew that, as soon as Virgin Music had gone, I would have to come back out of 
the  corner  and  slug  it  out  with  British  Airways.  I’d  already  lost  count  of  the  rounds  we  had  fought  and  
was beginning to feel punch -drunk and exhausted.  
We had to wait before signing contracts, since Fujisankei, our 25 per cent shareholder, had a pre -
emptive clause that allowed them to match any offer for Virgin Music. We also had to decide whether 
to accep t  Thorn  EMI’s  offer  of  £510  million  in  cash  and  taking  on  Virgin’s  debts  fixed  at  £50  million;;  
or £500 million in cash and whatever debts were in the company at the date of completion in four 
weeks’  time.  Although  we  had  to  continue  to  run  Virgin  Music  in   the normal manner, Ken felt sure 
that by completion the debt would be smaller.  
‘There  are  some  good  sales  going  on  at  the  moment,’  he  said.  ‘Let’s  take  all  the  money  now.’  
And so we opted for £510 million plus £50 million of debt in Virgin Music. In the ev ent Ken was 
right (as always!) and we earned an extra £10 million by choosing this option. In the meantime, we 
had  to  wait  until  3a.m.  before  Fujisankei  finally  threw  in  their  lot  with  us  and  opted  for  Thorn  EMI’s  
cash. We signed contracts as dawn was brea king. The next morning Thorn EMI announced the 
purchase of Virgin Music for exactly $1 billion – or £560 million.  
Simon, Ken and I went to see the staff at our Harrow Road offices.  
‘It’s  like  the  death  of  a  parent,’  Simon  said  to  me  as  we  went  inside.  ‘You  think  that  you’ve  
prepared  for  it,  but  when  it  happens  you  realise  that  you’re  totally  unable  to  cope.’  
I felt that it was more like the death of a child. Simon, Ken and I had started Virgin from scratch, 
kept it going through all the times when it looked  as if it was coming to an end, and reinvented it with 
every generation of music so that it continued to be the most exciting record label in the business. 
While other record labels such as Apple still symbolised The Beatles and Abbey Road, Virgin had 
leapfrogged from Mike Oldfield and Gong to The Sex Pistols, then Boy George, then Phil Collins, 
then Peter Gabriel, then Bryan Ferry, then Janet Jackson and The Rolling Stones. Throughout each era 
– hippie, punk, new wave – Simon’s  taste  had  prevailed  and  Ken   had kept everything together.  Ken now stood up and told everyone that they would become part of Thorn EMI, and that he 
would  be  staying  with  EMI  to  ensure  Virgin’s  independence.  Simon  started  to  speak  but  instead  burst  
into tears. Everyone looked at me. I stood up, on the verge of tears myself. It was no good. I was in an 
impossible  situation.  I  couldn’t  tell  them  the  real  reason  why  their  company  had  been  sold.  If  I  told  
them  the  truth  about  the  bank’s  attitude  to  Virgin  Atlantic,  then  the  airline  and  the   rest of the Virgin 
companies would be damaged by lack of confidence. Airlines are all built on confidence, and an 
admission of weakness would scare away passengers. And so, hating myself for appearing to have 
cashed in, I stood there and offered everyone a  job at Virgin Atlantic if they were unhappy with EMI, 
and assured everyone that Ken would look after them. When Jon Webster proposed a vote of thanks to 
me,  Simon  and  Ken  for  ‘the  best  years  of  our  lives’,  I  could  bear  it  no  longer.  I  left  the  room  and  se t 
off at a sprint down Ladbroke Grove, tears streaming down my face.  
Oblivious to the stares of passers -by, I must have run for almost a mile. When I passed a 
newspaper stand I saw an Evening Standard  poster that should have dried the eyes of most grown 
men:  ‘BRANSON SELLS FOR £560 MILLION CASH ’.  I  ran  past  it,  tears  still  streaming  down  my  
face, and somehow made my way home. Joan was out, so I went into the kitchen and put on the kettle. 
It was a cold March morning, but the cherry trees at the end of the g arden and in Holland Park were 
just beginning to blossom. As I stared outside, a fox broke cover from the hedge and trotted across to 
the back door, where Joan left out scraps for it. It picked up a chicken carcass and then turned on its 
heel and vanished into the undergrowth. The last photograph I had seen of Lord King had shown him 
on horseback, resplendent in full hunting gear.  
‘Feeling  thoroughly  depressed,’  I  wrote  in  my  notebook  about  my  decision  to  go  for  cash  rather  
than  shares.  ‘Decided  to  go  for  t he conservative route for the first time in my life. All my advisers (bar 
John  Thornton)  were  advocating  it.’  
As well as picking up an extra £10 million by choosing the fixed -debt option, Ken also gained us 
another £9 million profit over the currency trans fer to Fujisankei. Thorn EMI paid us the £510 million 
in cash, of which we had to pay £127.5 million to Fujisankei. Fujisankei wanted their money in yen, 
so  we  had  to  change  it.  We  had  a  month’s  grace  between  taking  the  money  and  passing  it  on  at  
completio n on 1 June. We had to choose when to switch into yen. Simon and Trevor wanted to do it 
immediately so that we all knew where we stood. Ken and I were a little more relaxed and inclined to 
gamble with it. We kept it in sterling and, as luck would have it, sterling appreciated against the yen. 
We let it run and changed it at the last moment, earning ourselves a further £9 million profit. Nothing 
like a bit of luck!  
And so the crisis was resolved. From the original cash purchase price of £510 million, Fujisan kei 
received £127.5 million, and we received more than £390 million. Simon and Ken took their share of 
the proceeds and went their separate ways. I used my proceeds to repay the bank and invested the 
remaining cash in Virgin Atlantic. Rumours about Virgin Atlantic having to pay for fuel in cash were 
now well and truly scotched. We had more disposable cash than British Airways.  
The banks immediately started calling me with renewed impatience – no longer to demand their 
money back, since we had returned their  debt to them, but to offer to put my funds in high -interest 
deposit accounts, offshore accounts; to invest it; to invite me for lunch; to do some kind of business 
with me; and – of course without seeing the irony – offering to lend me as much money as I w anted to 
finance any future deals!  It took a while for me to understand the implications of the sale. For the first time in my life, I 
had enough money to fulfil my wildest dreams. In the immediate future I had no time to dwell on this, 
because that very w eek the British Airways story took a turn that occupied all my attention. In some 
ways  I  was  pleased  that  I  didn’t  have  time  to  think  about  the  sale  of  Virgin  Music.  I  hate  living  in  the  
past.  I  particularly  didn’t  want  to  think  about  all  the  lost  friendsh ips. But the weight had been lifted 
from my shoulders and at the back of my mind I was aware that the Virgin Group was now free to 
develop in whichever direction we chose. Virgin Music may have gone; Ken and Simon and I had 
split up; but the best was yet t o come.  
‘Penni,’  I  asked,  ‘please  can  you  give  me  Freddie  Laker’s  number  in  Miami?’  
I dialled the number.  
‘Freddie,’  I  said.  ‘It’s  Richard  here.  I’ve  decided  to  take  your  advice:  I’m  suing  the  bastards!’  
‘Go  for  it!’  said  Freddie.  
* * *  
As we embarked on the court case, the single thing that I had to keep reminding myself was that this 
was a libel case, not an argument over business practices. I had to clear my name.  
Marshalling the evidence happened in three stages: we had all our own ev idence which we 
already knew; we received a vast collection of documents from British Airways under the rules of 
legal disclosure; and a great deal of evidence began to materialise from disillusioned British Airways 
staff. It was this evidence that was the  most powerful.  
Out of the blue, Gerrard received a call from an ex -BA employee called Sadig Khalifa who had 
worked in the airline industry since 1974, when he was employed by British Caledonian in Tripoli. 
When British Airways took over B -Cal in 1988, Kha lifa joined a division within BA called Special 
Services which dealt with any special passenger problems. In 1989 he started work as a check -in agent 
at Gatwick Airport and then joined the Helpline section, which was ostensibly there to meet BA 
passengers,  help them transfer between flights, and look after elderly people. Another more 
clandestine  activity  was  to  try  to  poach  other  airlines’  passengers.  There  was  an  equivalent  team  at  
Heathrow  nicknamed  the  ‘Hunters’.  
In April 1990 the Helpline team was take n over by Sales and Reservations and the new boss, Jeff 
Day,  came  into  the  Helpline  office  and  announced  to  Khalifa  and  his  team  of  fifteen  staff  that  ‘money  
doesn’t  come  from  helping  old  ladies  to  the  gate.  What  you  have  to  do  is  get  out  and  get  more  
passengers  from  other  airlines.’  Khalifa  told  Gerrard  about  a  second  meeting  in  August  which  Jeff  
Day  specified  had  to  be  a  ‘closed  meeting’:  no  non -Helpline staff could attend or were to hear about it.  
At this meeting, Jeff Day told Khalifa and his colleagues  that Helpline had a new task: to 
accumulate as much information about Virgin Atlantic as possible. This included flight information: 
the number of passengers booked on flights, the actual number of passengers who went on board the 
aircraft, the mix betwee n upper class and economy, and the time of departure. At the end of each shift 
the Helpliners had to fill out a form on each flight and personally give it to a Mrs Sutton, who gave it to Day. And how were they to get the information? Jeff Day told the Help liners that they could get it 
by using the Virgin flight numbers to gain direct access to the British Airways Booking System, 
known  in  the  trade  as  BABS.  This  was  something  they  had  assured  Virgin  that  they  wouldn’t  do.  The  
locks on the Helpline room were changed, and they were to keep the nature of their activities secret. 
One woman working alongside Khalifa refused to join in these activities since she thought that they 
were immoral, and the rest of the team covered for her.  
Gerrard took a statement from Khalifa, and we sent it across to British Airways. It was set to 
become one of the main planks of the court case.  
Immediately  after  Khalifa’s  affidavit  arrived  with  BA’s  lawyers,  I  received  a  call  from  Michael  
Davis, a BA nonexecutive director who was a lo ng-standing friend of my parents. He asked me 
whether we could meet for breakfast.  
At  our  meeting,  Michael  began  talking  about  ‘egg  on  face’.  This  was  the  first  hint  of  apology.  He  
had obviously been singled out as the one nonexecutive who could talk to me . Lord King and Sir 
Colin Marshall were still clearly unwilling to bring themselves down to my level and acknowledge 
that there was any truth in my accusations, but Michael Davis – as a family friend – had been 
designated the person who could best finesse the difficult idea that BA might have made some 
mistakes.  
‘I  think  the  three  of  us  should  have  a  little  chat,’  Michael  said.  ‘A  little  chat.  The  three  of  us   – 
you,  me  and  Sir  Colin.’  
‘Sir  Colin?’ 
‘Yes,  he’s  going  to  be  around  for  the  next  ten  years,  you  se e. You see, the King is dead; long live 
the Marshall. I think it would be a sensible thing to do to meet up, the three of us, and see if anything 
sensible  can  come  out  of  it.’  
I watched Michael Davis grope for the appropriate words. Reading between the lin es, he was 
telling  me  that  Lord  King’s  days  at  British  Airways  were  over.  
‘You  see,  certain  people  at  British  Airways  recognise  that  there’s  been  a  certain  amount  of  egg  
on  face,’  he  confessed.  ‘There  has  been  an  acceptance  of  that  egg,  but  if  we’re  going   to have a sensible 
relationship  in  the  future  I  think  you,  me  and  Sir  Colin  should  sit  down  together.’  
As I listened to his tortured syntax and his attempt to offer me a deal, I realised that I was 
listening  to  someone  talking  about  somebody  else’s  money  a nd  somebody  else’s  livelihood.  Michael  
Davis, Sir Colin Marshall, Robert Ayling and Lord King would receive their salaries no matter what 
they had initiated at British Airways. The BA shareholders would stump up money to pay for Brian 
Basham, to pay for th e detectives, and to pay for their lawyers when I sued them. Perhaps it was a 
good investment: if they had managed to put Virgin Atlantic out of business it would have been 
money very well spent. But Virgin Atlantic was primarily my own company. It was a p rivate company 
and, if BA poached an upper -class passenger to New York, that was £3,000 that Virgin would lose: 
£3,000  that  we  couldn’t  reinvest  in  the  business.  And,  unlike  BA,  I  had  no  vast  corporate  reserves  I  
could draw on to fund salaries. So, for all  his  talk  of  ‘egg  on  face’,  Michael  Davis  was  missing  the  
point: BA had tried very hard to put me out of business and my staff out of their jobs. They had also forced me to sell Virgin Music, which had affected a whole group of other people who had nothing  to 
do  with  the  airline.  It  made  me  furious.  I  was  not  going  to  sit  back  over  a  gentleman’s  breakfast  and  
agree  that  it  was  all  just  a  certain  amount  of  ‘egg  on  face’.  
Throughout the entire dirty -tricks  episode  I  had  been  accused  of  being  ‘naive’:  naive  to  believe 
that British Airways could behave in such a manner, naive to think that British Airways would ever 
stop behaving in such a manner, naive to believe that I would ever be able to bring British Airways to 
court, naive to think for a moment that I cou ld  win  a  court  case.  The  word  ‘naive’  echoed  round  and  
round in my head and at some points had almost undermined my resolve to go on. Sir Michael Angus 
told  Sir  Colin  Southgate  that  I  was  naive  to  take  on  British  Airways  ‘as  if  it  was  a   Boy’s  Own  story’;;  
Jeannie  Davis  told  my  parents  that  ‘Ricky  should  learn  to  take  the  rough  with  the  smooth’;;  and  even  
people  like  Sir  John  Egan  of  the  BAA  told  me  ‘not  to  shake  the  money  tree’.  Perhaps  I  was  naive  in  
fighting for the justice I wanted; perhaps it was idealism ; or perhaps I was just plain stubborn. But I 
knew  that  British  Airways’  activities  were  unlawful  and  I  wanted  compensation.  I  was  determined  to  
make  all  those  people,  who  had  dismissed  my  stance  as  ‘naive’,  eat  their  words.  
I called Gerrard Tyrrell after the breakfast and told him how sympathetic and persuasive Michael 
Davis had been.  
‘Rubbish,’  he  retorted.  ‘BA  had  the  chance  to  settle  at  the  beginning  but  they  didn’t.  It’s  only  
because  their  lawyers  are  now  looking  into  a  black  hole  of  guilt  that  they’re  being forced to consider 
settling.’ 
I had never heard Gerrard sound so angry.  
‘You’ll  never  have  a  better  opportunity  than  now  to  nail  them,’  he  went  on.  ‘Don’t  cave  in  now.’  
‘Just  testing  you,’  I  said.  ‘Of  course  I  won’t  cave  in.’  
The next week we met George Carman, our formidable QC who was preparing our case. With his 
white  hair  and  impeccable  manners,  George  seemed  like  everyone’s  favourite  uncle  outside  the  courts.  
Inside, he had the subtlety, tenacity and killer instinct of a p raying mantis. People went to 
extraordinary lengths to avoid him.  
‘What  do  you  think  of  my  opening  line  of  address?’  George  asked  us.  ‘The  World’s  Favourite  
Airline   has   a   favourite   pastime.   It’s   called   “shredding   documents   which   are   liable   to   be  
misconstru ed”.’ 
I  called  Michael  Davis  and  told  him  that  I  couldn’t  agree  to  let  my  accusations  slip  under  the  
carpet. The court case was set to start in January and the British Airways directors would be cross -
examined  by  George  Carman.  I  didn’t  even  need  to  hint  a t how much George Carman would relish 
this. Sobered by this prospect, Michael Davis put down the phone.  
By now I felt really confident that we could beat BA. Not only had we discovered so much about their 
dirty tricks, we had also found out details of an e xtraordinary BA undercover operation.  
Someone contacted my office to say that he had some information about an undercover operation 
set up by BA involving various private detectives. He said that he had a computer disk containing a diary of everything the private detectives had done. He insisted that I meet him personally before he 
handed over the disk.  
I felt rather strange as I climbed into the car with one of my assistants, Julia Madonna. This was 
partly due to the fact that I was wearing a microphone hi dden in my crotch area so that I could tape 
my  conversation  with  the  contact.  I  knew  how  vital  the  tape  of  Brian  Basham’s  meeting  with  Chris  
Hutchins  had  been,  and  I  wasn’t  going  to  leave  anything  to  chance  with  this  meeting.  When  I  set  up  
Virgin Atlantic I had no idea that I would have to resort to James Bond -style activities in order to run 
it! 
I scribbled in my notebook as our contact talked:  
  
Trying  to  find  out  what  we  were  up  to  [but]  didn’t  want  to  give  that  impression.  Not  at  Lord  
King’s  level  …  Being  careful  not  to  be  seen  to  do  any  investigation  only  putting  up  defences.  
Most importantly, our contact gave us the computer disk. When I had i t printed out it was a 
revelation. The private detectives had kept an extremely detailed log of what they had been up to and 
who they had been reporting to at British Airways. The log revealed that the operation had been 
codenamed  ‘Covent  Garden’.  The  firs t  entry,  dated  30  November  1991,  stated,  ‘First  sight  of  Project  
Barbara  report  seen  in  S1’s  office  in  Enserch  House  [BA’s  central -London  HQ].’  ‘S1’  turned  out  to  be  
the  codename  for  David  Burnside,  and  ‘Project  Barbara’  was  the  report  on  Virgin  that  Basha m had 
given to Chris Hutchins.  
Most   of   BA’s   top   management   had   been   named,   but   they   had   been   given   alphanumeric  
references so that their real names never appeared in print. I found it relatively easy to establish who 
was  who:  Lord  King  was  ‘LK’  or  ‘C1’;;  Co lin  Marshall  was  ‘C2’;;  and  Basham  was  ‘S2’.  There  were  
others,  ‘R1’  and  ‘R2’,  who  were  unknown  to  us.  They  turned  out  to  be  the  private  detectives,  Nick  Del  
Rosso and Tom Crowley, who were leading the team under the guise of trying to find the mole inside 
BA who was leaking information to us. Operation Covent Garden was supposedly run by Ian Johnson 
Associates,  ‘international  security  management  consultants’.  The  log  detailed  how  Johnson  and  Del  
Rosso  briefed  BA’s  director  of  security,  David  Hyde,  and  the  l egal director, Mervyn Walker, on the 
progress of operation Covent Garden. It also recorded meetings with Robert Ayling and Colin 
Marshall.  
The  log  contained  astonishing  details  of  how  the  team  of  detectives  had  convinced  some  of  BA’s  
senior management that  we were running an undercover operation against BA. The amount of money 
they estimated we were spending on our nonexistent operation was £400,000. We later found out that 
BA was spending £15,000 a week on Covent Garden.  
The sheer absurdity of the operatio n was revealed by details of how the detectives had staked out 
the Tickled Trout Hotel in Lancashire with secret cameras and sound -recording equipment. The idea 
was  to  secretly  record  a  meeting  between  Burnside  and  an  ‘agent’  that  the  Covent  Garden  team  ha d 
convinced themselves was working for Virgin. The log recorded how their plans came unstuck when 
Burnside failed to turn on his bugging device! I could have spared BA the trouble: I never have 
employed private detectives and never will. That is not how I or Virgin operate.  When I had finished reading the Covent Garden log I felt as if I had returned from a parallel 
universe – one  created  in  the  imaginations  of  BA’s  hired  conspiracists  and  senior  management  at  the  
cost of thousands of pounds. I really began  to look forward to the libel case, which was being heralded 
as  the  ‘mother  of  all  libel  trials’.  
7 December 1992  
‘BA  have  collapsed,’  George  Carman  told  me.  ‘They  have  today  paid  just  under  half  a  million  pounds,  
£485,000  to  be  precise,  into  court.  They’v e  admitted  in  effect  that  they’re  entirely  guilty  as  charged.’  
We  later  discovered  that,  just  before  the  court  case  was  due  to  start,  BA’s  lawyers  had  told  them  
that they had no hope of winning. If they wanted to avoid the humiliation of having to stand in  the 
witness box and be cross -examined by George Carman, and seeing all their activities written up in the 
press, then their only option was to make a payment into the court and start negotiating an out -of-court 
settlement.  
At first I was in two minds over  whether to accept the money. I was innocent, and we could put 
all the BA directors in the witness box and destroy them. But then, as we talked about it, I realised 
that, although this was tempting, such a move could be seen to be vindictive and was highly  risky. 
‘You’ve  got  to  remember  why  you  brought  this  case,’  George  Carman  advised  me.  ‘You  wanted  
the dirty tricks to stop and you wanted to clear your name. BA have admitted that you are totally right. 
You’ve  cleared  your  name.  
‘If  you  persist  with  the  ca se, then two things may go wrong. The jury might award you damages 
but  they  might  think  that  you  were  such  a  rich  man  that  you  didn’t  need  £500,000  and  just  award  you  
£250,000. That would be seen as a failure for you and a triumph for British Airways. If t he jury award 
you less than British Airways have paid into court, then you will have to pay both sets of costs. So you 
may win the case but lose a lot of money, and people will be confused as to why Virgin Atlantic has to 
pay  £3  million  of  costs.’  
This las t  part  of  George’s  advice  was  very  persuasive.  Although  in  some  ways  my  decision  to  
settle  out  of  court  could  be  something  of  an  anticlimax,  in  that  we  wouldn’t  have  the  satisfaction  of  
watching George Carman cross -examining the directors, by deciding to a ccept  BA’s  offer  we  won  a  
completely clear -cut victory with no risks attached and were immediately free to get on and run the 
business.  
‘What  do  we  have  to  do  now,  then?’  I  asked.  
‘We  have  21  days  in  which  to  take  the  money  out  of  court  if  we’re  going  to  a ccept  it.’ 
‘So  we’ll  do  that?’  
‘Good  Lord,  no,’  George  said,  looking  shocked.  ‘I’m  not  going  to  accept  it.  I’m  going  to  get  them  
to  give  us  at  least  £600,000.  If  they’ve  given  £485,000  they  can  go  up  to  £600,000.  Every  £100,000  
makes an inch bigger headlin e.’ George spent a week negotiating over the payment. On 11 December 1992 we agreed the terms 
of the highest uncontested libel payment ever made in British legal history: £500,000 to me personally 
to compensate for the personal libel, and £110,000 to Virgi n Atlantic to compensate for the corporate 
libel. 
11 January 1993  
‘VIRGIN SCREWS BA ’  was  the   Sun’s  headline.  There  wasn’t  much  room  for  anything  else  on  the  
front page.  
‘I’d  have  preferred  it  the  other  way  round,’  Kelvin  MacKenzie,  the   Sun’s  editor,  told  m e.  ‘It  
would  have  made  a  better  headline.’  
I  was  in  George  Carman’s  chambers  with  Gerrard  Tyrrell  and  my  father,  whom  I  was  delighted  
to share in the triumph. We walked round to the High Court in the Strand and jostled our way through 
the mass of photograp hers outside. The corridor outside court eleven, where the hearing would take 
place, was teeming. Inside the court it was very quiet. British Airways were noticeable by their 
absence: Lord King, Sir Colin Marshall and Robert Ayling, the three main protagon ists,  weren’t  there.  
David Burnside was absent. Brian Basham had gone abroad, but his lawyers were there making a last -
ditch attempt to have his name removed from the statement of apology. The judge listened to the plea 
and  then  asked  British  Airways’  coun sel  their  opinion.  They  agreed  with  Virgin  that  Brian  Basham’s  
name should be included in the apology. The judge ruled that the apology should stand as prepared.  
George Carman stood up and read the agreed statement. When he came towards the end, there 
was complete silence in court:  
‘British  Airways  and  Lord  King  now  accept  unreservedly  that  the  allegations  which  they  made  
against the good faith and integrity of Richard Branson and Virgin Atlantic are wholly untrue. They 
further accept that Richard Branson a nd Virgin had reasonable grounds for serious concerns about the 
activities of a number of British Airways employees, and of Mr Basham, and their potential effect on 
the business interests and reputation of Virgin Atlantic and Richard Branson. In these circ umstances, 
British Airways and Lord King are here now by leading counsel to apologise and to make very 
substantial payments to the plaintiffs by way of compensation for the damages and distress caused by 
their false allegations. They also seek to withdraw their counterclaim against Virgin Atlantic and 
Richard Branson.  
‘In  addition,  British  Airways  and  Lord  King  have  agreed  to  pay  Richard  Branson  and  Virgin  
Atlantic’s  legal  costs  in  respect  of  the  claim  and  the  counterclaim  and  have  undertaken  not  to  repeat  
the  defamatory  allegations  which  are  the  substance  of  this  action.’  
George Carman paused and took a breath. The court held its breath.  
‘British  Airways  and  Lord  King  are  to  pay  Richard  Branson  £500,000  damages  and  are  to  pay  
Virgin  Atlantic  £110,000  damages.’  
George had to raise his voice to make himself heard above the sudden noise in the court:  ‘In  the  light  of  the  unqualified  nature  of  the apology and the payment of a very substantial sum 
by way of damages, Richard Branson and Virgin Atlantic consider that their reputation is publicly 
vindicated  by  agreeing  to  settle  the  action  on  those  terms.’  
I  saw  tears  running  down  my  father’s  cheek s as he listened to the settlement. He had a large silk 
handkerchief in his breast pocket and he took it out to wipe his eyes. I clenched my fists under the 
table to stop myself from jumping to my feet.  
The single jarring note was in the British Airways ap ology when, although they apologised 
unreservedly, they then went on to absolve themselves of any blame:  
‘The  investigation  which  British  Airways  carried  out  during  the  course  of  this  litigation  revealed  
a number of incidents involving their employees whic h British Airways accept were regrettable and 
gave Richard Branson and Virgin Atlantic reasonable grounds for concern. I should however like to 
emphasise,’  their  counsel  said,  ‘that  the  directors  of  British  Airways  were  not  party  to  any  concerted  
campaign against  Richard  Branson  and  Virgin  Atlantic.’  
A number of people in the court snorted with derision. It had been the one phrase that British 
Airways had refused to take out of the apology.  
‘Let  them  leave  it  in,’  George  Carman  had  finally  advised  me.  ‘People  will  see  exactly  what  it  
really  means.  We  haven’t  heard  the  last  of  that  word  “concerted”.’  
Then,  with  the  judge’s  permission,  Basham’s  counsel  stood  up  to  point  out  that  his  client  did   not 
accept that the references to him in the foregoing statement were an accurate summary of his actions 
on behalf of BA.  
Outside, in the mad hustle of journalists and photographers, I held up both hands and shook my 
fists in triumph.  
‘I  accept  this  award   not  only  for  Virgin,’  I  said,  ‘but  also  for  all  the  other  airlines:  for  Laker,  for  
Dan Air, Air Europe and B -Cal.  They  went  under  and  we  survived  British  Airways,  but  only  just.’  
Back at Holland Park the party started. I decided to share the £500,000 damag es which had been 
given to me among all the Virgin Atlantic staff, since they had all had to suffer from the pressure 
which British Airways had put us under, in the form of reduced salaries and cuts in their bonuses. The 
television was on in the corner and  every news programme covered the Virgin success as the main 
story of the day. ITN even interviewed Sadig Khalifa and Yvonne Parsons. The party stopped to cheer 
them momentarily, and then went on.  
Much later, I was in the middle of talking to someone when a wave of exhaustion hit me. I 
realised that we had won. All the stress relaxed out of my shoulders; I smiled a wide, happy, contented 
smile, toppled sideways and fell deeply asleep.  
 
 29 Virgin territory  
1993 –1998  
NINETEEN NINETY -THREE  was a watershed for V irgin. From that moment onwards, and for the 
first  time,  we  had  the  luxury  of  money;;  and  in  ‘Virgin’  we  had  a  strong  brand  name,  which  could  be  
lent to a wide variety of businesses. We faced uncharted territory, but at last we could afford to follow 
our in stincts, rather than spend all our time persuading others to do so. Once we had made the lateral 
and surprising jump from Virgin Records to Virgin Atlantic, we could try our hand at anything. We 
were a long way from when we first copied out an old record c ontract on the houseboat and signed 
Mike  Oldfield.  Times  had  changed  and  we  had  £500  million  in  the  bank.  But  I  didn’t  believe  in  
leaving it there.  
At this point I could of course have retired and concentrated my energies on learning how to 
paint watercolo urs  or  how  to  beat  my  mum  at  golf.  It  wasn’t,  and  still  isn’t,  in  my  nature  to  do  so.  
People  asked  me,  ‘Why  don’t  you  have  some  fun  now?’  but  they  were  missing  the  point.  As  far  as  I  
was concerned, this was fun. Fun is at the core of the way I like to do b usiness and it has been key to 
everything  I’ve  done  from  the  outset.  More  than  any  other  element,  fun  is  the  secret  of  Virgin’s  
success. I am aware that the idea of business as being fun and creative goes right against the grain of 
convention,  and  it’s  cer tainly not how they teach it at some of those business schools, where business 
means  hard  grind  and  lots  of  ‘discounted  cash  flows’  and  ‘net  present  values’.  
Even  though  I’m  often  asked  to  define  my  ‘business  philosophy’,  I  generally  won’t  do  so,  
because I  don’t  believe  it  can  be  taught  as  if  it  were  a  recipe.  There  aren’t  ingredients  and  techniques  
that will guarantee success. Parameters exist that, if followed, will ensure a business can continue, but 
you cannot clearly define our business success and the n  bottle  it  as  you  would  a  perfume.  It’s  not  that  
simple: to be successful, you have to be out there, you have to hit the ground running; and, if you have 
a good team around you and more than your fair share of luck, you might make something happen. 
But yo u  certainly  can’t  guarantee  it  just  by  following  someone  else’s  formula.  
Business  is  a  fluid,  changing  substance,  and,  as  far  as  I’m  concerned,  the  group  will  never  stand  
still. It has always been a mutating, indefinable thing and the past few years have d emonstrated that. 
But it is only when you come to write a book such as this that you discover how far you still want to 
go.  That’s  how  I  see  this  book:  a  comprehensive  account  of  the  first  fifty  or  so  years  of  my  life   – the 
struggling years – but also a wo rk and a life in progress. This book was never intended to be as dry as 
a balance sheet, but will, I hope, give an idea of what has been important to my life and to the people 
around me thus far.  
Virgin has expanded over the last few years, perhaps more qu ickly than any other European 
group, and has developed radically in the process. Our way of doing business may remain the same, 
but the context has changed dramatically. After the sale of Virgin Music and our victory over British 
Airways in January 1993, I  realised that, for the first time in my business career, I had climbed the 
wall  and  could  at  last  peer  into  the  promised  land.  It  hadn’t  always  been  possible.  For  anyone  who  
starts without financial backing there is a very thin line between success and fa ilure. Survival is the 
key priority. No matter how many successes Virgin had had, there was always the danger that the cash 
would run out. Virgin has made money, but I have always invested it in new projects in order to keep 
the group growing. As a result,  we had rarely had the luxury of spare cash to use as a cushion.  Over the years we have clung on through three recessions; we have suffered losses; we have 
closed down some businesses and, in some instances, we had to make some staff redundant. But after 
1993 no bank would ever again be able to dictate to us how to run our business. We had financial 
freedom.  I  was  one  of  a  rare  breed:  most  entrepreneurs  don’t  manage  to  survive  that  far  or  for  that  
long. In the process of gaining that freedom, we had to over come all kinds of obstacles thrown without 
warning into our path.  
When we were established as a mail -order record company, and thus dependent on the post, out 
of the blue came a six -month  postal  strike.  If  we  hadn’t  reinvented  ourselves,  we  would  have  gone  
bust. There was no choice. Within days of the strike we had opened our first Virgin Records shop. It 
may have been up a dark, narrow flight of stairs above a shoe shop and have consisted merely of some 
shelves, a shabby sofa and a till, but in its own sma ll way it taught us all we now know about retailing. 
I can draw a straight line from that tiny shop to the Virgin Megastores in London, Paris and New 
York.  It’s  just  a  matter  of  scale,  but  first  you  have  to  believe  you  can  make  it  happen.  
In the same way, as the record label gathered momentum through those early years, every deal 
was make -or-break. We may have failed to sign 10cc, but we were still willing to put the company on 
the line when we tried again with the next band. We launched the airline on a wi ng and a prayer, and 
when the engine blew up on our test flight it might have been over before it had begun. We were 
lucky: each time something went wrong, we were the smallest jump ahead of the banks.  
However tight things are, you still need to have the b ig picture at the forefront of your mind. The 
most vivid proof of this came during the depths of the recession in 1992. At the time, I was trying to 
raise money to install individual seat -back videos in all our aircraft – I have always believed that 
Virgin  should offer the best in -flight entertainment. We needed £10 million to install the equipment. 
Nobody at Virgin Atlantic could raise the necessary funding and we were all sitting down at Crawley 
one day in despair, on the point of giving up, when I though t I would try one last gamble.  
Nervously, I picked up the telephone, called Boeing and asked to speak to the CEO, Phil Conduit. 
I asked him whether, if we bought ten new Boeing 747 –400s, he would throw in the individual seat -
back videos in economy class. P hil was amazed that anyone was thinking of buying planes during that 
recession, and he readily agreed. I then called Jean Pierson at Airbus, and asked him the same question 
about the new Airbus. He agreed. After a few further enquiries, we discovered that it was easier to get 
£4 billion credit to buy eighteen new aircraft than it was to get £10 million credit for the seat -back 
video sets. As a result, Virgin Atlantic suddenly had a brand -new fleet of planes, the youngest and 
most modern fleet in the industr y,  at  the  cheapest  price  we’ve  ever  been  able  to  acquire  planes  before  
or since.  
The Virgin Group has always had a life of its own and I have always tried to think ahead with it. 
When I tried to sell Student to IPC Magazines back in the early 70s, they shi ed away from me because 
I started talking about all the other business opportunities I wanted to explore: a Student travel 
company that would offer cheaper travel than the existing airlines, a Student bank because I thought 
that students were being ripped off when they had no income to protect them. I even wanted to hire 
trains from British Rail because their tickets were so expensive and their trains were always late. Even 
then, I was attempting, with limited resources, to explore what was possible by want ing to go into 
some of these businesses and turn them upside down. At the time, it was all theoretical and beyond my 
capacity, but some interesting ideas emerged from the process. I may be a businessman, in that I set up and run companies for profit, but, when I try to plan ahead and dream up new products and new 
companies,  I’m  an  idealist.  
My  grandiose  plans  didn’t  work  for  Student.  But,  following  the  sale  of  Virgin  Records,  I  was  
once again ready to start pushing at the barriers. This time it was rather d ifferent:  I  didn’t  have  just  a  
few pounds in the Student biscuit tin – which we ended up spending on takeaway curries – but a 
treasure chest of hundreds of millions of pounds. In an intoxicating moment, everything seemed 
possible. We had the finance, and, even  more  importantly,  we  had  the  name,  ‘Virgin’,  which  already  
had a track record of reinventing itself. There was nothing to stop us becoming something else.  
I give free rein to my own instincts. First and foremost, any business proposal has to sound fun. If 
there  is  a  market  that  is  just  served  by  two  giant  corporations,  it  appears  to  me  that  there’s  room  for  
some healthy competition. As well as having fun, I love stirring the pot. I love giving big companies a 
run for their money – especially  if  they’re  offering  expensive,  poor -quality products.  
In the early 1990s, there were already scribblings in my notebook about the possibility of 
launching a range of Virg in soft drinks, led by Virgin Cola, which could take on the might of Coca -
Cola,  one  of  the  world’s  top  ten  companies.  The  Cott  Corporation  specialises  in  bottling  own -label 
colas and was looking for a brand that could have global appeal.  
‘You’ve  got  the  X   factor, the Y factor – you’ve  got  every  factor  there  is,’  Gerry  Pencer,  the  chief  
executive  of  Cott  Corporation,  said  to  me.  ‘People  like  Virgin;;  they  trust  the  name;;  they’ll  buy  a  
product  because  it’s  a  Virgin  product.  So  how  about  it?  We’ve  got  the  recip e;;  you’ve  got  the  name.  
What  do  you  say  to  Virgin  Cola?’  
As usual, when people warn me against doing something once my mind is made up, I grow 
increasingly determined to try it. In this case we all recognised that it would be an inch -by-inch fight 
along th e shelves of the supermarkets but, once we established that there was minimal financial risk if 
we failed, we decided to proceed. We knew that the product was as good as either Coke or Pepsi, and 
the first blind tasting we had at the local school, which wa s followed by many across the country, 
established that most people preferred Virgin Cola to the others. And so we went into Virgin Cola. 
Within a few months we were selling £50 million worth of Virgin Cola across the country and had 
grabbed 50 per cent of  the market in the outlets that stocked it. We went on to launch it in France, 
Belgium and South Africa, and we even managed to place a Virgin Cola machine right underneath the 
Coke  sign  in  Times  Square,  New  York.  This  was  after  we’d  driven  a  Chieftain  tan k through a wall of 
Coca -Cola and Pepsi cans, and fired at the Coke sign hanging above Times Square!  
Initially Coca -Cola  head  office  didn’t  take  Virgin  Cola  seriously  as  a  threat  so  we  had  no  
opposition  from  them.  What  I  didn’t  know  was  that  based  in  Atlan ta,  in  Coke’s  head  office,  was  an  
English lady working in a senior position for Coca -Cola. She warned the management there that 
Virgin had the power and the brand to rock Coke on a wordwide basis and she persuaded her directors 
to let her set up a SWAT tea m in England to try and stamp us out. Within days she and her team had 
moved to England. Retailers were offered unbeatable terms from Coke to take their cola over ours. 
Smaller retailers were threatened with removal of Coca -Cola fridges. The campaign from Coca -Cola 
was even more potent than the dirty tricks campaign from British Airways to stamp out Virgin 
Atlantic but Virgin Cola survived. Ironically this very same lady now holds a senior position at 
Virgin’s  main  clearing  bank.  Looking to the future, I ha d no idea whether Virgin Cola would become a global leader in soft 
drinks or not, but, as with all of our businesses, I keep an open mind. But I do know that Virgin Cola, 
which has now expanded to become Virgin Drinks, is indicative of the Virgin philosoph y – beneath all 
the fun and razzmatazz of selling it there is a sound business plan. The decision to launch Virgin Cola 
was founded on three key things: finding the right people, the positive use of the Virgin brand name, 
and protection of the downside.  
The business plan for Virgin Cola was clear: we would never lose much money selling it. It is so 
cheap to produce that, unlike most other products, the manufacturing cost is negligible. We could 
therefore balance the advertising and distribution costs direct ly against the sales. One look at Coca -
Cola’s  balance  sheets  is  enough  to  reveal  what  a  profitable  business  it  is,  and  with  that  kind  of  margin  
we knew there must be plenty of room for someone else to come in with a decent cola to sell alongside 
Coke and P epsi. 
Once I was convinced that we had protected the downside – which is always my first concern – 
the other significant question to resolve was whether the move into Virgin Cola really enhanced the 
Virgin brand name. Despite objections from colleagues, I was persuaded that cola has a number of 
attributes that people associate with Virgin: fizz, fun and freedom. Not only that, but ours was a better, 
cheaper cola than the others. We thrived on the fact that we were small and a newcomer up against the 
two gia nts. And it meant that we kept the brand alive in the youth market.  
‘All  right,’  people  admitted,  when  they  heard  my  defence  of  Virgin  Cola.  ‘I  can  see  that  cola  is  
fun.  It’s  fizzy  and  profitable  and  fits  the  Virgin  image.  But  surely  not  life  insurance?  Wh at on earth are 
you  doing  selling  life  insurance,  mortgages  and  investments?’  
I have to admit that some healthy discussions about life insurance took place before we decided 
to  launch  Virgin  Money.  ‘Life  insurance?’  everyone  snorted  when  they  heard  the  ide a.  ‘People  hate  
life insurance. All the salesmen seem so unscrupulous, barging into your home and taking secret 
commissions.  It’s  a  terrible  industry.  It’s  definitely  not  a  Virgin  kind  of  business.’  
‘Exactly,’  I  said.  ‘It’s  got  potential.’  
It is no secret that  I  love  playing  devil’s  advocate.  I  could  see  all  the  bad  points  about  the  
financial -services industry. The idea of setting up Virgin life insurance and a Virgin bank would have 
horrified our original staff at Albion Street, or our customers who lounge d about on the beanbags at 
the record shop. And yet, whenever I see people getting a bad deal, I want to step in and do something 
about it. Of course, this is not pure altruism – there’s  a  profit  to  be  made,  too.  But  the  difference  is  that  
I’m  prepared  to   share  more  of  the  profit  with  the  customer  so  that  we’re  both  better  off.  The  maverick  
in me was also quietly amused that the guy who brought you The Sex Pistols could sort out your 
pension, too. Another part of me was equally amused by the idea that we we re going to set up our own 
bank to give those very banks that nearly foreclosed on us a run for their money.  
My attention had first been brought to the financial -services industry by Rowan Gormley, a 
venture capitalist I had asked to work for Virgin to ide ntify new business opportunities. One of the 
first things he did was review the Virgin pension policy, which he told me made no sense. When he 
asked six different pension advisers to give quotes as to how best to restructure it, he was the bemused 
recipien t of six different answers.  ‘I  don’t  understand  it,’  he  told  me.  ‘I’ve  three  degrees  in  finance,  but  none  of  what  they’re  saying  
makes  sense.’  
Instinctively, I felt that the world of financial services was shrouded in mystery and rip -offs and 
that there mu st be room for Virgin to offer a jargon -free alternative with no hidden catches.  
As with our other ventures, we needed a partner who both knew the industry and could put up the 
money to go alongside the Virgin name. Despite some of our past difficulties, I  still believe that a 
fifty-fifty partnership is the best solution to financing. When something goes wrong, as it invariably 
will at some point, both partners have an equal incentive to put it right. Such is not always the case. At 
worst, such as with Rand olph Fields and Virgin Atlantic, Virgin will buy out the partner entirely. At 
best, as with Sprint, our partner with Virgin Mobile in America, it stays at fifty -fifty and both sides 
remain content. In between these poles there can be many variations and we  have tried out most 
combinations. Ultimately, you never know what to expect when dealing with other people and, 
although you might both appear to go into a project with the same enthusiasm, situations can change. 
Knowing when and how to renegotiate a cont ract is all part of the challenge of business.  
Virgin Money, our financial -services company, started off as Virgin Direct with Norwich Union 
as a fifty -fifty partner. After Virgin entered the financial -services industry, I can immodestly say it 
was never t o be the same again. We cut out all commissions; we offered good -value products; and we 
were practically trampled by investors in their rush to buy. We set up a new office in Norwich rather 
than rent a gleaming tower block in the City of London. We never e mployed fund managers, some of 
the  world’s  most  highly  paid  people,  since  we  discovered  their  best -kept secret: they could never 
consistently beat the stock -market index.  
We launched aggressively and the initial signs were good but, in spite of our success , we realised 
that we were going faster and further than was comfortable for Norwich Union. It looked like we 
would be three times the size we had originally predicted. After a short time we arranged for Norwich 
Union to sell their shareholding to a partne r who shared our ambitions, Australian Mutual Provident 
(AMP). Together with AMP and our great team at Virgin Money, we had cut a broad swathe through 
the financial -services jungle. From a standing start in 1995, it is staggering to think that Virgin Money  
had  become  the  country’s  most  popular  investment  house,  and  250,000  people  had  trusted  us  with  
over £1.5 billion, and all this had been achieved within three years.  
The success of Rowan Gormley and his vision for Virgin Money illustrates one of the great 
strengths of the Virgin Group: we thrive on mavericks. The quality that I recognised in Rowan when I 
first asked him to work for Virgin was that he would make things happen. When he started work 
perched at a desk on a half -landing at 11 Holland Park, neith er of us had any idea that a few months 
later he would start up a financial -services company. When – unsurprisingly, with hindsight – he 
alighted upon financial services, we arranged a company structure that gave him and his team a 
shareholding in the busi ness and let him get on with it. Like all the managers of Virgin companies, 
Rowan was given a high incentive to succeed because he could clearly see the wealth that success 
would bring him and his team.  
Virgin Money may appear to have been an incongruous d eparture  for  Virgin,  the  rock’n’roll  
company: it was a lateral leap in the same way as it had been from records to airline. But it was still all 
about service, value for money and offering a simple product. The vision I have for Virgin does not run along t he orthodox lines of building up a company with a vast head office and a pyramid of 
command from a central board of directors. I am not saying that such a structure is wrong – far from 
it. It makes for formidable companies from Coca -Cola to Pearson to Micr osoft. It is just that my mind 
doesn’t  work  like  that.  I  am  too  informal,  too  restless,  and  I  like  to  move  on.  
People  have  always  asked  me  what  the  limits  to  Virgin  are,  and  whether  we  haven’t  stretched  the  
brand name beyond its natural tolerance. With monotonous regularity, they point out that there is no 
other company in the world that puts its name to such a wid e variety of companies and products. They 
are absolutely right, and it remains something of which I am proud.  
It  doesn’t  stop  me  thinking  about  the  question  nonetheless,  and  the  answer  isn’t  easily  explicable.  
I have always lived my life by thriving on opp ortunity and adventure. Some of the best ideas come out 
of the blue, and you have to keep an open mind to see their virtue. Just as an American lawyer called 
me to suggest setting up an airline in 1984, a Swedish ballooning fanatic asked me to fly across t he 
Atlantic with him in 1987. The proposals come in thick and fast and I have no idea what the next one 
will be. I do, however, know that, if I listen carefully enough, the good ideas somehow all fit into the 
framework that Virgin has become. By nature I a m curious about life, and this extends to my business. 
That curiosity has led me down many unexpected paths and introduced me to many extraordinary 
people. Virgin is a collection of such people and its success rests on them.  
The more diffuse the company be comes, however, the more frequently I am asked about my 
vision  for  Virgin’s  future.  I  tend  either  to  avoid  this  question  or  to  answer  it  at  great  length,  safe  in  the  
knowledge that I will give a different version the next time I am asked. My vision for Vir gin has never 
been rigid and changes constantly, like the company itself. I have always lived my life by making 
lists: lists of people to call, lists of ideas, lists of companies to set up, lists of people who can make 
things happen. Each day I work throug h these lists, and it is that sequence of calls that propels me 
forward. Back in the early 1970s I spent my time juggling different banks and suppliers and creditors 
in  order  to  play  one  off  against  the  other  and  stay  solvent.  I’m  still  living  the  same  way ,  but  I’m  now  
juggling bigger deals instead of banks. Once again, it is only a matter of scale.  
As  anyone  in   my  office  knows  when   I’ve  misplaced  it,  my  most  essential  possession   is   a  
standard -sized school notebook, which can be bought at any stationery sho p on any high street across 
the country. I carry this everywhere and write down all the comments that are made to me by Virgin 
staff and anyone else I meet. I make notes of all telephone conversations and all meetings, and I draft 
out letters and lists of telephone calls to make.  
Over the years I have worked my way through a bookcase of them, and the discipline of writing 
everything down ensures that I have to listen to people carefully. Flicking back through these 
notebooks now, I see some ideas that escap ed me: I was asked to invest in a board game called Trivial 
Pursuit and a wind -up radio. But, when I turned down the offer to become an underwriting name at 
Lloyds Insurance, my guardian angel must have been looking after me.  
Whenever  I’m  on  a  flight  or  a   train or in a record store, I walk around and ask the people I meet 
for their ideas on how to improve the service. I write them down and, when I get home, I look through 
what  I’ve  written.  If  there’s  a  good  idea,  I  pick  up  the  phone  and  implement  it.  My  st aff were 
maddened to hear that I had met a man on the airport bus who suggested that we offer onboard 
massages – and  please  could  they  organise  it?  They  tease  me  and  call  it  ‘Richard’s  Straw  Poll  of  One’,  but, time and again, the extra services that Virgin  offers have been suggested to us by customers. I 
don’t  mind  where  the  ideas  come  from  as  long  as  they  make  a  difference.  
I also insist that we continually ask our staff for any suggestions they might have, and I try my 
hand at their jobs. When I tried pus hing a trolley down the aisle of a jumbo, I found I crashed into 
everyone. When I talked to the crew about this, they suggested that we introduce a more waitress -style 
service and keep the trolleys to a minimum. As it turned out, by getting rid of trolleys  altogether in 
Upper Class, we were able to use up some of the aisle space to provide the longest and largest seats in 
the air.  
My  vision  for  Virgin  was  ultimately  summed  up  by  Peter  Gabriel,  who  once  said  to  me,  ‘It’s  
outrageous! Virgin is becoming everyt hing. You wake up in the morning to Virgin Radio; you put on 
your Virgin jeans; you go to the Virgin Megastore; you drink Virgin Cola; you fly to America on 
Virgin  Atlantic.  Soon  you’ll  be  offering  Virgin  births,  Virgin  marriages,  Virgin  funerals.  I  think   you 
should  rename  Virgin  the  “In  and  Out  Company”.  Virgin  will  be  there  at  the  beginning  and  there  at  
the  end.’ 
As ever, Peter, who is an astute businessman as well as a gifted musician, was very close to the 
truth. He had no idea at the time that we had t wo hundred people down in Eastbourne working on a 
range of Virgin cosmetics, another team designing a range of Virgin clothes, or that we were just 
about to bid for two British Rail franchises that would make us the largest train operator in Britain. I 
doubt  that  we’ll  ever  go  into  Virgin  funerals,  but  Virgin  Births  has  a  certain  ring  to  it.  If  there’s  a  good  
business  plan,  limited  downside,  good  people  and  a  good  product,  we’ll  go  for  it.  
In some ways it all boils down to convention. As you might have noticed, I do not set much store 
by such so -called wisdom. Conventionally, you concentrate on what you are doing and never stray 
beyond fairly narrow boundaries when running a company. Not onl y do I find that restrictive, I also 
think  that  it’s  dangerous.  If  you  only  run  record  shops  and  refuse  to  embrace  change,  when  something  
new like the Internet or MP3 is launched you will lose your sales to the person who makes use of the 
new medium. Even in the heady days of 1999 I felt it was far better to set up your own Internet 
operation  to  which  your  record  shops  lost  business  than  lose  it  to  somebody  else’s  Internet  operation.  
Various outside advisers did try to get us to launch an Internet site, biz arrely suggesting that we do 
this  without  using  our  name.  ‘This  is  the  age  of  Currant  Bun,  Handbag  and  Jamjar,’  they  said.  They  
just  didn’t  understand  brands.  
This partly explains the jigsaw of companies we have. As well as protecting each other, they have  
symbiotic relationships. When Virgin Atlantic starts a flight to South Africa, I find that we can launch 
Virgin Radio and Virgin Cola there. In the same way, we can use our experience in the airline industry 
to make buying train tickets easier and cheaper . We can draw on our experience of entertaining people 
on planes to entertain people on trains.  
Despite employing around 40,000 people, Virgin is not a big group – it’s  a  big  brand  made  up  of  
lots of small companies. Our priorities are the opposite of our large  competitors’.  Convention  dictates  
that a company should look after its shareholders first, its customers next, and last of all worry about 
its employees. Virgin does the opposite. For us, our employees matter most. It just seems common 
sense to me th at, if you start off with a happy, well -motivated  workforce,  you’re  much  more  likely  to  
have happy customers. And in due course the resulting profits will make your shareholders happy.  Convention  also  dictates  that  ‘big  is  beautiful’,  but  every  time  one  of  our ventures gets too big we 
divide it up into smaller units. I go to the deputy managing director, the deputy sales director and the 
deputy  marketing  director  and  say,  ‘Congratulations.  You’re  now  the  MD,  the  sales  director  and  the  
marketing director of a  new  company.’  Each  time  we’ve  done  this,  the  people  involved  haven’t  had  
much more work to do, but necessarily they have a greater incentive to perform and a greater zest for 
their work. The results for us have been terrific. By the time we sold Virgin M usic in 1992, we had as 
many as fifty subsidiary record companies, and not one of them had more than sixty employees.  
But there is little point in looking back, except to note that, since then, Ken Berry consolidated 
and made Virgin Music the most profitab le  jewel  in  EMI’s  crown,  before  moving  on  early  in  2002.  
For us, we were now free to start again with V2 Records, using the same techniques and skills. Our 
first signing may not have made quite the same impact as Mike Oldfield, but The Stereophonics were 
still named Best Newcomers in the Brit Awards for 1998, and have gone on to great things since.  
The Virgin way has been to develop many different ventures and grow organically. For most of 
our companies, we have started from scratch rather than merely buyin g them ready -made. We want 
each of the Virgin subsidiaries to be an efficient, manageable size. When it comes to setting up new 
companies,  one  of  my  advantages  is  that  I  don’t  have  a  highly  complicated  view  of  business.  When  I  
think about which services I want to offer on Virgin Atlantic, I try to imagine whether my family and I 
would  like  to  buy  them  for  ourselves.  Quite  often  it’s  as  simple  as  that.  
Of course life becomes more complicated when you move away from organic growth. In recent 
years Virgin has bought companies to add to the ones that we have set up. The purchase of MGM 
Cinemas was the first big acquisition we made, and we also bought two substantial British Rail train 
franchises. While we were able to fix the cinema chain relatively quickly, bef ore selling it to the 
French company UCI, the trains are a much longer -term prospect. In some ways we became a victim 
of our own success in that the train passengers expected that, as soon as Virgin had taken over the 
running of the trains, miraculous chan ge would take place. Unfortunately, the logistics of the task 
were against us: our two train companies had 3,500 employees and we needed to build a completely 
new fleet of trains and at the same time negotiate with Railtrack over how they could upgrade the  
tracks and signalling.  
Despite  a  difficult  time  in  the  railway  industry  as  a  whole,  we’re  confident  that  Virgin  Rail  will  
come to be seen as one of the best things Virgin ever did with its brand.  
 
 
 
 
 
 30 Diversity and adversity  
1998 –2005  
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT  has happened in the last decade. This book opens with my first attempt 
to fly around the world in a balloon, a trip that ended up in the deserts of Algeria. It was my last 
ballooning trip, at the end of 1998, however, which finally knocked some sense into me.  I realised that 
it  was   perhaps   time  to   put   to   better  use  everything   I’d  learned  during  my  personal   adventures.  
However, it had been a magnificent trip.  
When  we  were  about  to  set  off,  someone  suggested  to  me  that  I  keep  a  diary,  and  I’ve  dusted  that  
down t o  use  here.  Rather  than  cut  it,  I’m  going  to  let  you  see  it  as  I  wrote  it,  so  that  you  can  get  a  sense  
of  what  it’s  like  to  be  adrift,  thousands  of  feet  above  the  surface  of  the  Earth,  with  just  the  wind  to  
power you.  
Day 1, 18 December 1998  
This is a dail y diary for Theo, my godson, who saw us lift off today from Marrakech, for Lochie, 
India, Woody, for all my special nephews and nieces, and for my children Holly and Sam.  
The delightful Moroccans welcomed us like brothers. Holly and Joan arrived at the air port. The 
balloon looked like a magnificent mosque and the sun was rising up over the Atlas Mountains. 
Strangely,  I  wasn’t  enormously  nervous  on  this  occasion:  we’d  had  such  a  good  team  planning  this.  
We’d  been  through  so  much  heartache  in  the  past  that  I   really felt that this time we had a good chance. 
The only serious problem was that last night the Americans and British had started bombing Iraq. And 
we  are  due  to  fly  along  the  Iraqi  border  in  thirty  hours’  time   – some fifty miles from it.  
We have Bob Ric e, the best weatherman (meteorologist) in the world. He believes he can help us 
find  the  winds  to  carry  us  right  along  the  border  without  crossing  into  it.  I’ve  promised  him  that  we  
will stuff him instead of the turkey this Xmas if he gets it wrong. That i s if we are not already stuffed 
ourselves.  
Almost all of my closest friends and family, except Sam, who had to be at school, had flown in to 
see us off, after having just travelled all the way with us to the Caribbean the day before to go on 
holiday. The m oment we arrived there, I was told to go all the way back because we had found the 
perfect weather. Weather so perfect that, if nothing goes too wrong, we could be back on my 
grandfather’s  birthday   – Boxing Day.  
We arrived to a wonderful welcome of musicia ns, camels, jugglers and even flying carpets. Alex 
Ritchie’s  children,  Alistair  and  Duncan,  my  daughter  Holly  and  Per’s  daughter  Jenny  were  together  to  
press the button to launch us into the air. We put on our parachutes. We said our goodbyes – to my 
mum a nd dad, my brother -in-law, my daughter and my friends. Tears were in their eyes.  
Countdown – 10–9–8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1 – then lift -off! We gently climbed 2,000 feet. The door was still open. Everyone was clapping and cheering. 
Then suddenly we started to sink: we had hit a weather inversion. We burned hard to warm the 
helium. We burst through the inversion. I realised we had overburned.  
We were shooting up and the bottom of the balloon was smouldering – 1,700 feet a minute, 1,800 
feet, 1,900 feet – until at last  we were slowing, but the liquid burners had burned holes in the bottom 
of the hot -air balloon. Fortunately for us they were right at the bottom. It was the helium balloon that 
was the critical one. We could fly on: ugly holes, but nothing to stop us.  
It’s wonderful. We are flying up with the birds and we are on our way. Everything seems to be 
working: we are up to flight altitude and the capsule has pressurised and the balloon has not burst. We 
are on our way at the beginning of a magnificent adventure, an d there below us are the beautiful Atlas 
Mountains covered in snow.  
Day 2, 19 December 1998  
For hours we had a magnificent flight watching the massive range of the Atlas Mountains that 
stretches across the whole of the north of Africa, from Morocco across Algeria, Libya and almost, I 
believe, to Egypt. We bade farewell to the Moroccans after about seven hours of flying and then 
headed out over Algeria.  
Algeria has become a very sad country due to a terrible civil war that is going on. We were 
plunged into t hat  two  years  ago  when  our  balloon  failed  at  night  and  we  had  to  land.  But  tonight  we’re  
flying along the Atlas Mountains, over the rugged desert where Alex and I had once had to throw 
everything we had out of our balloon to stop a rapid descent – we even threw out an envelope full of 
dollars! Alex saved our lives on that occasion by climbing out on the roof and releasing fuel tanks just 
before we hit the deck.  
This time everything seemed to be going well.  
Almost too well! When it began to get dark and the helium above us cooled, we turned on the 
burners. Instead of plunging, as we had on our last attempt around the world, the heat stopped any 
descent and the flames lit up the Arabian skies around us. We had to be careful not to fly higher than 
we had during  the day or the heat would vent the helium and shorten the time we had in the sky. So 
we took it in turns to fly during the night.  
Then, very tired, we suddenly had a major spanner thrown in the works. A message from Libya 
came through saying they had withdrawn our right to fly over their country. It was night -time, pitch 
black, and we could never land before crossing their border. St eve, Per and I debated what we could 
do about it. If we had gone very low we might have been able to crawl around the south of Libya, but 
that would mean abandoning our dreams. In the end we decided to slow up the balloon by dropping 
lower to give us time to try to persuade Colonel Qaddafi, who rules Libya, that ours is a sporting 
mission undertaken in the interests of peace. The King of Jordan had been a great help to us 
previously, and I had also been honoured in the past to know Nelson Mandela – and I kn ew he knew 
Colonel Qaddafi quite well. So my wonderful secretary Sue opened up my office in the early hours of 
the morning and got hold of their telephone numbers.  Our next concern was the realisation that they would all be asleep. The King of Jordan is un well 
with cancer, and Nelson Mandela is not a young man, so I decided to write one of the most important 
letters in my life to Colonel Qaddafi.  
  
Excellency  
I am making this personal and direct appeal to you from the ICO Global Challenger Balloon in 
which the general post and telecommunications company of Libya has a significant investment.  
A mutual friend of ours, his Royal Highness King Hussein of Jordan, spoke to you about my 
plans to try to circumnavigate the globe in a balloon. You graciously granted us permission to 
cross your country.  
Early today we took off from Morocco in the certain  knowledge that we had permission to 
overfly your country. We would not have done so had we not had the permission and goodwill of 
both Algeria and Libya. We are currently over Algeria and we will cross your border in the early 
hours of this morning.  
Libya n overflight clearance permit OVG11@01001 was graciously extended on 20 July 
1998 to us for this flight. Your Air Traffic Control personnel have just informed us that this 
permission has been rescinded. We obviously understand that they have every right to  do this, but 
I’m  afraid  that  it  is  impossible  to  land  a  balloon  at  night  due  to  the  icing  that  forms  on  the  helium  
valve. We are unable to vent the helium to descend.  
Because of this emergency condition, we simply do not know how to avoid crossing your 
airspace. We hope that you will grant us emergency permission under these circumstances via 
your air -traffic control services.  
Thank you for your understanding of this problem.  
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,  
Richard Branson  
By that point we were all extremely tired and purposefully flying much slower than the balloon was 
capable of, to give us time. Then the onboard phone rang and we were told that, even though it was 
one  o’clock  in  the  morning,  Colonel  Qaddafi  had  granted  us  permission  to  go  on.  Alth ough our route 
to go around the world had been made more difficult by the slower path, the bigger, immediate 
problem was that by slowing down we had changed direction and were headed towards a storm over 
Istanbul in Turkey. Hopefully we could ride above it . 
Whether through the pressure of all of this, or some bug, I was beginning to lose my voice. We 
decided I should go on a course of penicillin just in case.  Per remains as calm as I have ever seen him. His dream, that started so many years ago, is finally 
coming true. And Steve is a pleasure to have on board. He is the only one of us who ventures into the 
kitchen,  producing  an  excellent  ‘Steve  Soup’.  
Morning has now broken and we have crossed the Libyan border. Miles and miles of desert and a 
warm welcome f rom air -traffic control in Tripoli. No military planes. Thank you, thank you, Colonel 
Qaddafi, from all of us in the ICO Global Balloon team.  
Day 3, 20 December 1998  
I  haven’t  slept  since  I  last  wrote  my  diary  24  hours  ago.  With  good  reason.  Let  me  share  t hese 24 
hours with you. I only wish right now that you could be up here with us. However, there were some 
moments in the day I would not wish on you.  
Let me first explain the challenge that faces all us balloonists who want to go around the world. It 
is no t just the elements, or the technological challenge. Sadly, it also involves people and politics. As 
always  in  life,  it  is  not  the  ordinary  people  who  get  in  the  way.  It’s  a  handful  of  politicians  at  the  top  
who selfishly make their country and this world a sadder place to live. After all, this is a sporting 
challenge and a mission flown in peace.  
Let me begin by suggesting that you pull out a map; imagine you are a balloonist in Switzerland, 
in America or in Morocco as we were. Then cross out some of the c ountries whose politicians say you 
cannot cross: Russia, Iran, and Iraq (remember, two balloonists who did cross the Russian border three 
years ago were cruelly shot down and killed).  
Imagine  you’re  in  a  race  to  be  the  first  around  the  world,  and  there  are  seven other balloonists 
waiting to take off. All of them will likely go well south of Russia and Iraq. You know that they will 
not experience the same hold -ups that you have, so every second counts and taking a risk becomes a 
necessity. So, when your weat herman says he believes he can squeeze you between Iran and Russia, 
instead of saying no, you take that risk. Even though it means flying down a 24 -mile-wide piece of 
land that is 2,600 miles from where you are taking off, and which is owned by Turkey and flanked by 
two countries in which you are not welcome.  
Remember, a balloon has no propulsion except the wind. The only way of steering is to change 
height as you go along to try to find winds going in a different direction. It helps you to have the best 
weatherman in the world.  
That weatherman tells you he thinks it can be done. You and your team decide to go for it. Then 
the night before you launch you are told that the British and the Americans are bombing Iraq and you 
are British and Steve Fossett is Ame rican. And this particular path is within fifty miles of Iraq.  
You would probably be certifiably mad to continue and until an hour ago I thought we were mad. 
But we knew our weatherman – we had worked with Bob Rice before over the Atlantic and Pacific – 
and we knew that, if anyone could help get us through this narrow crack between two countries in 
which we have no permission to fly, it would be him. And the very minute I am writing this diary, we 
are coming out of the other end of the crack, with Iraq and Iran on one side of us and Russia on the 
other. We, with the help of our magnificent team back at base, have miraculously crept through.  Twenty -four hours ago we said goodbye to Libya as it was getting dark and headed out over the 
Mediterranean towards Cyp rus. An RAF Hercules flew overhead. They said they were on their way to 
bomb Iraq. They wished us good luck, and we wished them the same.  
I  had  just  tried  to  lie  down  to  get  some  sleep  when  Steve  shouted,  ‘Get  your  parachute  on   – we’ve  
been  told  there’s  a   very  high  thunderstorm  ahead.’  Steve  had  lost  his  balloon  in  a  similar  thunderstorm  
over the Pacific only two months before, so he knew only too well what havoc they could wreak. By 
climbing, the wind would blow us over Iraq. What was worse – a possible st orm  ahead  or  the  ‘storms’  
of Iraq? In the distance, we could see the traces of anti -aircraft fire. We decided to risk the thunder and 
pressed on. Somebody was looking over us. We not only missed the storm but also missed Iraq by 
thirty miles, Iran by seven  miles and Russia by ten miles. Right now our weatherman can do no 
wrong. If he gets us home for Boxing Day, the champagne is on me.  
The views from where we are flying are breathtaking. We are crossing the snow -clad Armenian 
mountains; below us is a little  village called Ararat, where Noah landed in his Ark. Over our headsets 
came the crackly sound of the air -traffic  controller  from  Armenia:  ‘On  behalf  of  all  the  Armenian  
people  we  would  like  to  say  welcome.’  It  was  said  with  such  genuine  friendliness.  If  o nly all countries 
could be so welcoming.  
About 2,600 miles gone – the width of the Atlantic Ocean – 20,000 left to go. Everybody feeling 
incredibly  exhilarated.  I  for  one  need  to  borrow  somebody  else’s  nails  for  the  rest  of  the  trip   – because 
I no longer h ave any of my own left!  
Day 4, 21 December 1998  
We are still flying, and our voyage becomes more awesome by the minute. We have moved from 
Turkey through our secret passage out into Armenia and over Mount Ararat. From there we went 
through Azerbaijan, a new independent state in the former USSR, out across the Caspian Sea, through 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (what wonderful names these states have). We then passed over 
Afghanistan, where a bloody civil war has raged for years. Afghanistan was one of the countries that 
Alexander the Great once conquered.  
Then, early this morning, a wonderful but rather frightening prospect dawned on us: the wind s 
had unexpectedly changed, and we would not now be able to fly to the north of the largest mountain 
range in the world, but would have to go straight across them.  
These were the awesome Himalayas, never crossed before by a balloon. We would cross Nepal, a  
remote kingdom between India and Tibet. Nepal is where the Buddha was born, but is also known for 
the largest mountain on earth – Mount Everest – which soars up to nearly 30,000 feet.  
This sounds wonderful, but, as with everything about trying to fly a ba lloon around the world, 
there  was  a  catch.  It  is  what’s  known  as  ‘deadly  curl -over’.  A  balloon  can  be  grabbed  by  the  wind  and  
literally smashed into the other side of the mountain, as one crosses it. To avoid this we will need to 
fly 1,000 feet above the m ountain for every 10mph we are travelling.  
We did our calculations based on our present speed of 80mph, and this meant we had to fly 8,000 
feet  above  the  mountain.  At  present  we  couldn’t  fly  more  than  30,000  feet,  so  we  would  have  to  fly  
40,000 feet over E verest to avoid being smashed on to the other side of it.  We  couldn’t  do  that.  Could  we  and  our  team  back  home  steer  us  between  Everest  and  the  next  
highest mountain, K2?  
Well,  we  won’t  know  for  a  few  more  hours,  so  tomorrow  if  we  succeed  I’ll  let  you  know . 
Day 5, 22 December 1998  
Well,  I’m  still  here  writing  my  diary,  so  we  must  have  missed  Everest  and  K2.  In  fact  we  steered  right  
between them – more by luck than skill this time, since the mountains had taken control of our 
direction and they were not goin g to let us go.  
We spent the last twenty -four hours following the beautiful mountain range. In the day they were 
exquisite. At night having them a few thousand feet below was an eerie feeling. Adding to our 
problems were masses of ice forming on top of the  balloon, blocking the helium valve.  
As daytime approached, enormous clumps of it would fall down on to our capsule. It was actually 
very  beautiful  and  I’ve  made  a  wonderful  film  of  our  crossing  of  the  Himalayas.  Hannibal  would  have  
been proud of us.  
Becau se  the  winds  died  on  us  we  didn’t  suffer  the  deadly  ‘curl -over  effect’  that  I  wrote  about  in  
yesterday’s  diary.  
Day 6, 23 December 1998  
We  were  three  hours  from  crossing  the  Chinese  border  when  they  dropped  a  bombshell  on  us.  ‘We’re  
revoking your permissio n  to  cross  China.  You  will  not  enter.’  We  had  no  choice.  We  couldn’t  land  in  
the Himalayas. That would mean almost certain death. But to fly into China when specifically told not 
to can also mean very serious trouble.  
The Chinese had originally given us pe rmission to cross the south of China. Because we had been 
sucked into the Himalayas we were going to enter China 150 miles north of where they had asked us 
to. 
So we had three hours to try to persuade them to let us in. I knew Sir Edward Heath, who was 
once Prime Minister of Britain and who had excellent relations with the Chinese. So our people first 
contacted him and he was good enough to speak to his contacts. I got through to Saskia in my office 
and  asked  her  to  contact  Tony  Blair.  ‘But  I  don’t  have  the  number  for  Downing  Street,’  she  said.  Tired  
out,  and,  to  be  frank,  pretty  worried  by  now,  I  raised  my  voice.  ‘Dial  192.  Get  it  from  Directory  
Enquiries!’ 
Tony Blair was good enough to write a personal letter to His Excellency Premier Zhu Rongji. I 
also co ntacted Peter Such – the head of one of our rival airlines, Cathay Pacific – who was based in 
Hong Kong, and who was also very helpful. And our British Ambassador in Beijing and his team were 
enormously helpful. Finally – a half -hour before we crossed the border – we got the word that we 
could enter as long as we stayed in the very bottom section of China. We soon realised this would be 
impossible. The winds would take us towards Shanghai – coincidentally a city I visited only two 
weeks ago, and a city that  Virgin Atlantic has recently applied for permission to fly to.  We then had word that the Chinese had held a press conference in Beijing and had stated that we 
had violated their airspace without permission – if we did not rectify this promptly the consequ ences 
could be severe. At the same time we received a message from our base in London, going through the 
probable sequence of actions that an escort fighter plane would adopt. We went through the sequence 
of events that we would try to adopt ourselves in o rder to comply.  
We were high over snow, cloud, mountains – to land would be suicidal. We then received a 
message from the Chinese Civil Aviation Authorities:  
  
PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT YOU MUST LAND AT LHASA AIRPORT AND CANNOT 
CONTINUE FLYING OVER OUR AIRSP ACE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT OBEY OUR 
REQUIREMENTS. PLEASE CONTACT LATER. YOU MUST OPERATE THE BALLOON 
AS REQUESTED BY LHASA ACC. THANKS FOR YOUR CO -OPERATION.  
BEST REGARDS@OPS OF CAAC  
Well,  the  words  ‘thanks  for  your  co -operation’  were  the  only  friendly  words  w e had heard in a while. 
A balloon cannot land at an airport. The weather conditions were atrocious, it would be dark in two 
hours, we were over mountains, and we were carrying five tons of propane. We were being asked, in 
effect, to commit suicide. I wrote  back to Virgin ICO Global Balloon Base asking them to contact the 
Chinese, explaining all our problems. We received a response one hour later:  
  
PLEASE BE INFORMED YOU MUST LAND. YOU CANNOT CONTINUE OVER OUR 
AIRSPACE.  
We were in a Catch -22 situation: to attempt to land would mean certain death, but to continue, without 
permission,  would  mean  that  we’d  almost  certainly  be  shot  down.  
I contacted the British Ambassador in Beijing and explained our predicament. He promised that 
he and his team would stay up all night to try to resolve it. I sent the Ambassador a note to pass on to 
the Chinese:  
  
WE KINDLY ADVISE THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO LAND NOW WITHOUT 
SEVERELY ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF THE CREW AND ANY PERSONS ON THE 
GROUND. WE CANNOT STEER THE BALLOON AS IT GOES WHERE THE WIND 
TAKES IT. WE HAVE FULL CLOUD COVER AND CANNOT SEE THE GROUND. WE 
CANNOT DESCEND THROUGH CLOUD AS IT WILL CREATE ICE ON THE BALLOON 
RESULTING IN US CRASHING. WE KINDLY BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT WE 
ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION AND 
APOLOGISE PROFUSELY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPLY WITH YOUR 
INSTRUCTIONS. WE ARE NOT BEING DISRESPECTFUL TO THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES. WE ARE JUST IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION THAT WE CANNOT 
RESOLVE AT PRESENT WITHOUT ENDANGERING LIVES. WE KINDLY REQUEST 
THAT YOU GIVE OUR TEAM MORE TIME TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM.  
OUR PILOT S HAVE TRIED EVERY FREQUENCY THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO US 
BUT ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT YOU. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO TRY. PLEASE CAN 
YOU ADVISE SOME MORE HF OR VHF FREQUENCIES.  
WE KINDLY REQUEST A RESPONSE TO THIS MESSAGE.  
We flew on nervously. After all the person al pleas from so many world figures, we hoped the Chinese 
wouldn’t  do  anything  too  dramatic.  
In the early hours of the morning, to our great relief, the following fax came through:  
  
SINCE THE VIRGIN GLOBAL CHALLENGER HOT -AIR BALLOON HAS INFRINGED 
THE PRIN CIPLES AGREED BY THE TWO SIDES AND THE PROMISES MADE BY THE 
UK SIDE AND DID NOT ENTER THE AIRSPACE WITHIN THE DESIGNATED AREA 
THE CHINESE SIDE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO DEMAND THAT IT SHOULD LAND. IN 
RESPECT OF THE APPEAL MADE BY AMBASSADOR GALSWORTHY THE CHINE SE 
SIDE HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES AND HAVE 
NOW DECIDED TO ALLOW THE BALLOON TO CONTINUE ITS FLIGHT. BUT THEY 
REQUEST THAT IT SHOULD LEAVE CHINESE AIRSPACE AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. 
IF THE CHINESE SIDE HAVE NEW REQUESTS THEY WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH THE 
BRITISH SIDE.  
We cannot thank the Chinese enough. Thank you.  
Day 7, 24 December 1998  
A bizarre thing happened to me as we left the Chinese coast. I received word from England:  
  
MANY CONGRATULATIONS! VIRGIN ATLANTIC HAS BEEN GIVEN PERMISS ION TO 
BE THE ONLY AIRLINE TO FLY TO SHANGHAI DIRECT FROM ENGLAND. BRITISH 
AIRWAYS HAS BEEN TURNED DOWN. HURRY HOME.  
It’s  a  strange  world.  One  minute  terrified  of  being  shot  down  over  Shanghai  in  a  balloon,  the  next  
being given permission to start flying a  747 there!  
It  would  have  been  delightful  news  if  we  hadn’t  found  ourselves  heading  for  North  Korea.  It  
seems that every country that did not welcome balloonists had a magnetic attraction to them. And 
North Korea is one of the most closed, heavily militari st countries in the world. We had been told not 
even to bother to apply for overflying rights.  Bob went into overdrive to find winds to take us south through South Korea. In the meantime, 
Kevin Stass – who with Erin Porter had been battling back at base to  get our overflight rights – 
thought, give it a go, and contacted the North Koreans.  
To the surprise and delight of all of us, a quick response came, welcoming us to overfly. Maybe 
as a nation they are now ready to become part of the wider world. For whate ver reason, we were 
extremely grateful. They were the last political headache we had to face before heading home. We 
now  had  ‘only’  the  biggest  ocean  in  the  world  to  cross   – 5,200 miles of the Pacific, America, and then 
the Atlantic Ocean.  
After everything  that had happened, in the first five days we had only travelled a third of the way 
around the world. The Pacific has claimed many other hot -air balloonists who have attempted a 
crossing. The day before Per and I successfully crossed the Pacific in a hot -air balloon, ten years ago, 
a delightful Japanese balloonist attempted it and perished. Only three months ago Steve Fossett hit a 
thunderstorm over the Pacific and was brought down near Fiji.  
We therefore all have enormous respect for the Pacific Ocean, and  yet strangely we were so 
relieved to have got through the political problems of the last few days that we felt somehow we 
would have a drama -free trip. It started well: we ended up crossing South Korea as it turned out, since 
Bob had already been working on changing our track successfully before North Korean permission 
came through. We then travelled on to a beautiful dawn over Mt Fuji, and Kansai in Japan. We could 
see literally thousands of people thronging the streets looking up at the balloon as we pas sed overhead. 
Will Whitehorn, my right -hand  man,  who  was  in  Kansai,  contacted  the  balloon  and  said  that  ‘it  was  
one of the most remarkable sights of my life – standing  and  watching  the  whole  place  come  to  a  halt’.  
The winds began to pick up, to our great r elief. We found speeds of between 150 and 180mph. 
We were being sucked into the jetstream and we needed it. We had used up a lot of fuel flying over 
the  Himalayas  and  had  to  race  home.  We  had  no  more  than  five  or  six  days’  duration  left,  and  two -
thirds of the way to go. But, with these speeds, we calculated we could cross the Pacific in less than 
forty hours; a day to cross America, another to cross the Atlantic and then home. Our spirits were 
high; we really thought we were in with a chance.  
Then we receiv ed  an  urgent  message  from  Bob  Rice.  It  began:  ‘We  have  a  potential  problem  that  
is   giving   me   great   concern.’   If   Bob   had   great   concern   about   something   then   so   should   we.  
‘Specifically,’  he  went  on,  ‘there’s  a  trough  out  there  that  will  have  an  elongated  she ar line from 
around Hawaii, northeastward. The result of a pattern shift like that will take the balloon southeast 
towards Hawaii and back into the Pacific Ocean. We need to get to the trough before it starts to shear. 
Maximum speed is critical: more so th an  on  any  other  occasion.’  
We knew what he meant – if we did not get through on time, we would be turned southward and 
end  up  in  the  water.  Or,  as  Mike  Kendrick,  our  base  commander,  said  five  minutes  later,  ‘This  is  a  
matter of saving you going into the dr ink,  so,  for  God’s  sake,  fly.’  So  we  went  as  high  as  we  could  to  
get  extra  speed,  but  we  could  only  find  ten  knots  more  at  altitude.  We  have  had  a  long  night’s  flying  
towards this trough. Bob reran the figures to see if ten knots was sufficient to push us through and on 
into America. If not, it is fortunate that the capsule was built to float. But I have no plan or wish to test 
it! The  diary  ends  here,  just  as  things  started  to  turn  for  the  worse.  I  didn’t  complete  it  as  we  were  
too busy just trying to stay  alive. I remember just before going to sleep on that last day when we had 
all but crossed the Pacific and had the States ahead, with the weather forecasters saying that we would 
be home in two days. The winds were so strong, about 200mph, and it looked as  if we were going to 
cross America on Christmas Day, with Father Christmas dangling far below us, and be home for 
Boxing Day.  
As I was going to sleep, I thought that this was almost too much for one person in their lifetime, 
to have such fantastic experien ces, and to be so fortunate. It was only when I woke up that I realised 
that fortune was not going to shine on us this time and that we were going to end up landing in the 
Pacific rather than being the first to travel around the world in a hot -air balloon.  
The wall of bad weather that we tried to beat had got there before us. We went as high as we 
could to get through it; we went as low as we could to get through it. But to no avail. It was as if a 
solid brick wall had been built right down the coast of Ame rica to stop us.  
We were very fortunate to find winds that took us back out into the Pacific, towards the only 
islands for thousands of miles – Hawaii. Once we were sixty miles from them, we crashed into the sea. 
The balloon dragged over the waves, bouncin g 300 feet each time, like the bombs in the Dambusters  
film. Pushing the dome on the roof open, we climbed out, hanging on for dear life. Then, finally, as 
the balloon hit the sea for the tenth time, we threw ourselves off, once again to be plucked out of the 
sea  by  helicopters,  which  just  managed  to  reach  us.  No  wonder  Virgin  sponsored  London’s  helicopter  
ambulance service!  
On Christmas Day I landed in Hawaii and decided to get to Necker Island, where all the family 
were. On Boxing Day I landed to find a s lightly surreal thing happening when I arrived. Nobody was 
in the big house. All my best friends and relatives were gathered at the very far end of the island, 
having  a  children’s  party.  The  reason  it  was  surreal  was  that  I’d  written  my  will  the  day  before  I’d  
taken  off  in  the  balloon  and  in  it  I’d  instructed  that,  if  the  balloon  had  gone  down  and  my  body  had  
been recovered, I was to be buried at that end of the island. I wanted my best friends and family to be 
at my funeral, and I wanted to be laid for eve r in this very special place. And so it was strange to be 
there in person, looking around and thinking, My God, what a different kind of party this could have 
been. 
And  it  was  at  that  time  that  I  thought,  OK,  I’ve  had  these  incredible  experiences;;  somebody  has 
been  kind  to  me  and  I’ve  survived  them.  These  exploits  had  helped  me  put  Virgin  on  the  map,  put  me  
on  the  map,  and  given  me  some  fantastic  memories  to  tell  the  grandchildren  one  day.  But  I’d  pushed  
my luck as far as I should. Now I could see that if I  could  use  the  position  in  which  I’d  found  myself   – 
where I could pick up the phone to President Mandela or Bill Clinton or Tony Blair and get straight 
through – I might be able to do something worthwhile. To use that power and position to try to fulfil 
my original dream – from when I was fifteen, starting the magazine and writing in my first editorial – 
about trying to change the world. I have always tried to use my position to help charities. When Diana 
died I was flying back from America and, like everyo ne else, I was deeply affected by her death. But, 
as a great friend of the princess, I felt it was important that I try to find a way to make something 
positive come out of her death. So I decided to put together the best album ever in her memory and 
pledg ed 100 per cent of the profits to a Diana memorial fund. Eric Clapton, Sting, George Michael, Chris de Burgh and Paul McCartney all contributed willingly. But I also wanted a fantastic song that 
would  reflect  Diana’s  life  and  which  could  be  sung  at  her  fun eral and then go on the album.  
I knew Elton John was a friend of Diana so I asked him if he would be prepared to perform 
‘Candle  in  the  Wind’  at  the  funeral  and  if  Bernie  Taupin  would  adapt  the  words  to  make  them  more  
appropriate for the occasion. I also made it clear that I wanted the song to go on the tribute album. All 
of  this  had  to  be  cleared  not  just  by  Diana’s  family  and  the  Queen,  but  also  by  the  church.  Three  
frantic days of negotiation followed but the Queen was minded not to allow it so I called Tony Blair 
and asked him if he would  intervene.  Fortunately  he  did,  because  Elton’s  performance  of  ‘Candle  in  
the  Wind’  captured  the  imagination  of  the  entire  world  and  made  what  was  already  a  terribly  difficult  
occasion almost unbearably poignant.  
At  the  time  Elton  John’s  career  was  in  a lull, but imagine my surprise when, a few days later, 
Elton withdrew permission for the single to go on the charity album. I wrote him a long letter 
expressing my anger which I decided not to make public. But, as is the way of these things, someone 
unscrupulous  found  it  when  rummaging  through  Elton’s  dustbins  and  inevitably  it  found  its  way  on  to  
the front page of the Sun. Fortunately our tribute album went on to make millions of pounds and was 
the biggest single contributor to the Diana, Princess of Wal es  Memorial  Fund.  And  ‘Candle  in  the  
Wind’  ended  up  by  being  the  largest -selling single in the history of music, selling some 33 million 
copies.  
What  I’d  always  thought  was  that  Virgin  should  be  more  than  just  a  money -making machine, and 
that, as Virgin ha s the wealth of a small nation, we should use that wealth to tackle social issues more 
than we had in the past. Companies do have a responsibility to tackle them. Bill Gates, over the last 
few years, has invested enormous amounts of money trying to develop  vaccines to stamp out deadly 
diseases.  Despite  the  difficult  time  he’s  had,  and  the  bad  press  Microsoft  has  received,  he’s  given  an  
awful  lot  back  to  the  community.  He’s  a  tremendous  example  to  all  other  entrepreneurs.  
When I was last in South Africa, I v isited some hospitals, particularly ones in Soweto. It was 
devastating to see the number of people whose lives have been destroyed by HIV/AIDS, including the 
millions of orphans who have become heads of households at the ripe old age of nine. After the lau nch 
of Mates in the UK, Virgin continued to support a number of organisations in the fight against 
HIV/AIDS around the world – but after this trip I vowed that we would in some way do even more to 
help stop this disease from wiping out entire generations.  
In  Africa,  I’m  also  a  supporter  of  an  organisation  that’s  trying  to  make  sure  that  the  2  per  cent  of  
Africa currently set aside for wildlife is increased to 4 or 5 per cent, giving the wildlife of Africa more 
wild areas in which to roam – areas that are no t just given over for cattle and farmers. Among my 
favourite animals in the world are the African wild dogs, a dying breed of animal, which I find 
fascinating. It would be a fantastic legacy for the next generation if twice as much land as is currently 
used can be fenced in for wild animals, giving them a greater chance of long -term survival.  
Another area of the world that has seen more than its fair share of trouble is Northern Ireland. 
Although there will always be extremists from both factions – Catholic  Republicans and Protestant 
Unionists – by the 1990s the public were increasingly getting tired of years of sectarian bombings and 
killings. In May 1998 Mo Mowlam was appointed Northern Ireland Secretary – an inspired choice. 
Mo is a completely down -to-earth woman who could relate to the ordinary man and woman in the street (literally – as it turned out). She decided to go above the heads of the politicians and directly to 
The People to hold a referendum on the future of Ireland. If she won, permanent peace  was a strong 
possibility. If she lost, the alternative was to go back to the last 30 years in which 3,500 people had 
been murdered. The referendum proposed that Northern Ireland would remain part of Great Britain 
but that, if one day the majority of citiz ens of Northern Ireland ever wanted a unified Ireland and they 
voted for it, they could have it.  
Two days before the vote the outcome looked uncertain. Mo is an old friend of mine and she rang 
me to ask if I would walk the streets with her. I think Mo felt  that I was popular in Ireland because of 
my ballooning and boating adventures and that I had no political or religious associations; she may 
also have wanted to send the message that with peace would come prosperity in the form of 
investment in business.  
Either way, the next day I set out for Heathrow with one of our PR staff, Wendy, who happened 
to  be  from  Northern  Ireland  herself.  In  the  lounge  she  turned  to  me  and  said,  ‘Richard,  I’m  sorry.  I  just  
can’t  come  with  you.  My  dad  will  kill  me  if  he  sees  me  w ith  you  campaigning  for  this  peace  treaty.’  
I’d  never  thought  of  her  as  Protestant  or  Catholic,  just  a  delightful  Irish  girl.  It  brought  home  to  me  
just what a difficult job Mo had ahead of her.  
In the end I persuaded Wendy to come. She bravely stayed with  Mo and me for the rest of the 
day.  By  the  end  of  the  day  Wendy  was  so  convinced  by  the  arguments  that  she  decided  to  vote  ‘yes’  
and  also  persuaded  her  mother  and  sisters  to  vote  ‘yes’  as  well.  Unfortunately,  she  realised  her  dad  
was a lost cause.  
That nig ht, having walked the streets of Northern Ireland and shaken hundreds of hands, we all 
went  back  to  Hillsborough  Castle,  the  Northern  Ireland  Secretary’s  beautiful  residence,  for  dinner  and  
bed to await the outcome. At least I knew my trip had secured four  extra votes!  
The next day the good news came through – the  ‘yes’  vote  had  been  won.  Peace  finally  had  come  
to Ireland. Since it was a peace voted by the people this time it felt like it just might hold.  
In  my  life,  I’ve  come  to  expect  the  unexpected.  It  s ounds easy enough to say, but all the things that 
have happened to me, to the family and to Virgin have taught me that you have to be prepared at all 
times to deal with surprises. You just develop a way of picking up your feet and getting on with it. But 
nothing  I’ve  ever  faced  made  me  ready  for  what  happened  on  11  September  2001.  
It was a quarter past three in the afternoon in Brussels, and I was about to stand up to address yet 
another  European  Union  inquiry  into  competition.  I’ve  sat  through  dozens  of  me etings like this, and 
there was nothing out of the ordinary about that September day. The same grey suits, it seemed, sat 
there, ranged against us. I knew the strength of our position, so I was already thinking ahead of that 
meeting, about getting home, se ttling back into the routine at work after a summer break with the 
family on Necker. This time it was not about an airline, nor was it about the music business, retailing 
or  the  railways:  it  was  about  the  incredibly  ‘interesting’  subject  of  ‘block  exemptio n’  for  European  car  
manufacturers. In other words, about the fact that the people who make cars rip us all off by 
controlling  who  sells  them,  and  at  what  price  they’re  sold  on  to  us.  I  was  there  because,  as  the  years  
rolled on and the world of the Internet  and call centres lowered the cost of distribution, it had become possible for Virgin to sell and deliver cars direct to the public at prices up to 25 per cent cheaper than 
the corner garage. In the previous year, we had sold more than six thousand.  
As I was about to launch into a withering attack on the vested interests of those who were sitting 
all around me in the room, someone quietly handed a note to the chairman, who looked up with an 
ashen face and announced to the shocked room that there had b een a terrorist attack in New York, 
which involved a number of aircraft. He then asked me if I wished to continue. None of us there knew 
quite how serious things were but they did not sound good; there was also some concern that the 
European Union building  could be a target. Nonetheless, I decided to carry on, deliver the speech, and 
answer  questions  from  the  members  of  the  European  Parliament,  knowing  full  well  that  everyone’s  
mind would be on New York.  
An hour later I was about to board a Eurostar train b ack to HQ, when I finally managed to get 
through  to  London.  ‘It  looks  like  Middle  Eastern  terrorists  took  over  four  aircraft,’  Will  said.  ‘The  
Twin Towers have just come down and there could be over ten thousand dead. Reports are also 
coming in of other ai rcraft  being  hijacked.  They’ve  closed  US  airspace.  In  your  absence,  we  turned  the  
planes  back;;  only  three  had  passed  the  point  of  no  return.  Since  then  they’ve  shut  US  airspace.  I  
suggest  we  talk  in  more  detail  once  you’re  back  and  all  gather  tomorrow  morn ing first thing at 
Holland  Park.’  
As I sat on the train with the chief executive of Virgin Cars, the full horror began to sink in. 
There was a woman sitting opposite us who was a banker, and was frantically phoning friends in 
London and New York to find ou t what she could. She began to give us a blow -by-blow account of 
what she knew: that the brokers Cantor Fitzgerald had been completely wiped out; that several French 
and American banks may have had severe casualties. Her distress was evident and I did what  I could 
to help her. I still had not seen any pictures, but I could tell from her tears just how awful things were.  
Only  that  morning,  I’d  run  my  mind  over  how  the  businesses  were  going.  In  the  run -up to 11 
September, Virgin Atlantic had continued its rem arkable success story. Singapore Airlines had 
become our partners, paying a record £600 million for a 49 per cent stake in March 2000, and we had 
remained the only profitable airline flying across the North Atlantic in 2001. The business felt so good 
that year, as others struggled with out -of-control costs, unfriendly service and ageing fleets. Indeed, I 
felt so confident about the business that I had continued expanding by starting a new airline in 
Australia almost exactly a year to the day before the Twin  Towers tragedy. It is called Virgin Blue and 
was based on the low -cost model of Southwest Airlines. Despite the weak Australian dollar and high 
fuel costs, it had thrived, driving airfares down and doubling the number of people flying on its routes.  
This was not the only new investment of the previous few years. We had done a lot to rationalise 
Virgin and its brand in the late 1990s and, by 11 September, we had a clear strategy in place, based on 
the  concept  of  ‘branded  venture  capital’.  Instead  of  being  a  conglomerate with lots of subsidiaries, 
Virgin  had  become  a  diverse  investor.  So  we’d  choose  business  sectors  carefully,  trying  to  bring  more  
competition  to  sectors  that  would  benefit  the  consumer.  Then  we’d  find  good  partners  and  managers  to  
take the bus inesses forward, with the eventual aim of letting them stand on their own two feet, just as 
companies like Virgin Records and Virgin Radio had already done.  But we were also turning our attention to whether we could make a difference in other areas. For 
nearly 250 days of the year I travel around the world, trying to make Virgin the most respected brand 
in the world; not necessarily the biggest, but the best.  
We had also built a great management team, both at UK and international levels, that could act as 
our eyes and ears across all the businesses, so the new investments had come at breakneck speed over 
the  previous  couple  of  years.  Virgin  Active  had  become  the  world’s  third  largest  health -club chain; 
thetrain -line.c om, selling rail tickets via the Internet across all the networks, had 5 million customers 
by  11  September.  Virgin  Mobile  was  Europe’s  fastest -growing mobile -phone company and, on the 
fateful day, was on the verge of doing a deal with Sprint to take our no -nonsense mobile offer to the 
American public.  
As part of the expansion of Mobile, we had also finally consigned the Our Price brand to the 
dustbin of history. Since we had bought the business from WHSmith in 1998, we had taken the 
decision to rebrand it a s  Virgin  to  sit  alongside  the  successful  Megastore  chain.  It,  and  Virgin’s  other  
presence on the high street, helped Virgin Mobile to achieve nearly 2 million customers by the 
beginning of 2002, and now over 5 million customers.  
One  of  the  first  things  I’d  checked, on hearing about the terrorist attacks, was whether or not 
anyone we knew had been involved. Frances Farrow, who had worked for us on the airline business 
over here and then moved to New York to marry her fiancé only that spring, lived near the T win 
Towers. She was helping out on the deal with Sprint for Virgin Mobile. We lost contact with her for 
three  days;;  later,  we  found  out  that  she’d  been  driving  near  the  World  Trade  Center  just  as  the  first  
tower started to fall. Luckily for us, all the oth er relatives and friends called to let us know they were 
OK. 
But  it  wasn’t  the  same  for  so  many  others,  and  I  had  a  taste  of  this  when  I  was  called  by  Howard  
Lutnick,  the  chairman  of  ‘Cantor’s’,  as  they  were  known  in  the  city.  On  the  Friday  night,  James  Ky le 
of Cantor Fitzgerald, the firm that had lost literally hundreds of employees in the tragedy, had called 
Will Whitehorn. They urgently needed to fly dozens of grieving relatives to New York but, since their 
entire operation had been wiped out, they did n ot know whether they would have a business, when the 
markets reopened, to pay the bill. On the Saturday morning we agreed to carry as many people as they 
needed across the Atlantic. Whatever problems we had, it was so very much worse for them.  
Howard rang that  afternoon  to  thank  me  personally.  I  couldn’t  begin  to  imagine  what  a  hellish  
time  he  was  having,  facing  the  loss  of  most  of  his  close  colleagues.  ‘Thanks  for  everything  you’re  
doing  for  us,’  he  said.  ‘It  means  a  lot  to  everyone  at  Cantor’s.’  I  felt  em barrassed that we could do 
only this much, especially when I learned, after his emotional and gracious phone call, that his own 
brother, Gary, had died in the devastating attack.  
I see from my diary entry on the computer for 12 September that all it says i s  ‘RB  – meeting all 
day  at  Holland  Park’.  And  it  was  a  gloomy  group  of  us  who  met  in  my  house  that  morning.  Present  in  
the sitting room were Richard Bowker, Patrick McCall, Will Whitehorn, Mark Poole and Simon 
Wright. Ironically, nobody was there from Virg in Atlantic. Steve Ridgway – the managing director – 
and his senior team had already enacted their emergency procedures and begun an urgent 72 -hour 
review of the entire business, with a view to making recommendations by the Friday of that week as to 
what w e should do. But all of us sitting around the table in Holland Park knew we were going to have to do something fast. With transatlantic routes closed to us, and the sudden drop -off in passenger 
numbers, Virgin Atlantic was set to lose £1.5 million a day. T hat  morning  I  had  spoken  to  BA’s  new  
boss – a delightful Australian called Rod Eddington – who had told me that BA could lose up to £8 
million a day. I suggested that we work together in our approach to government to see what assistance 
we might get, once American airspace opened again. I was heartened by his straightforward reply: 
‘Good  on  ya,  mate!  I’ll  call  you  at  the  start  of  next  week.’  
The  fact  that  BA  may  have  been  in  even  worse  trouble  than  we  were  wasn’t  much  consolation  to  
the six of us sitting ar ound my drawing -room table in the bright September sunshine. As we drew up 
lists of what we were up against, it was clear that we had enough cash in the various companies to see 
ourselves through the worst, but that the potential black hole at Virgin Atlan tic needed to be plugged 
as quickly as possible. The other uncertainty was what was going to happen to our competitors. We 
knew that Sabena in Brussels and Ansett in Australia were going into administration, but would they 
survive?  
That weekend, the plans we’d  had  ready  for  such  an  emergency  were  used  for  the  first  time.  The  
team  at  Virgin  Atlantic  did  a  fantastic  job  in  their  assessment  of  the  ‘market  failure’  between  the  UK  
and the USA, and, as a result, drew up an emergency restructuring plan. There were  some painful bits 
to this: more than 1,200 jobs would go at the airline in the UK, but they did what they could to make 
the thousands of others secure. Most importantly, they switched larger aircraft, such as the 747 –400s, 
on to booming routes in Africa, and put the smaller Airbuses into service across the North Atlantic.  
On the Sunday morning we pressed the button to go ahead with the restructuring and told the 
staff on the Monday. I will never forget the good grace and professionalism with which they too k the 
news and then got on with the job. The months that followed were sticky but we had called it right in 
the first week: by Christmas it was clear that Virgin Atlantic was through the worst and would survive. 
This was no mean feat given that our America n competitors went cap in hand to their government, and 
received massive cash handouts from them. This may be what got them through, but all we saw was 
that it gave them leeway to behave more anti -competitively than they usually do.  
The irony of the situat ion was this: not only had we built up such a fantastic team of people but, 
until  11  September,  we’d  been  profitable.  My  biggest  worry  at  that  point  was  how  morale  in  the  
business would react to these enforced redundancies. It was a testament to everybody involved that, 
not only did a lot of the older and part -time staff come forward and volunteer, but those who stayed 
really buckled down in the spirit that undoubtedly made Virgin Atlantic what it is today. The 
innovative nature of the airline – using bed -seats and in -flight masseurs, to make passengers more 
comfortable – now meant, ironically, that we were the first to install bulletproof Kevlar cockpit doors, 
to  further  ensure  passengers’  safety.  
It  would  have  been  harder  for  Virgin  Atlantic’s  management  to  be  as  single -minded as they were 
if they had to worry about short -haul  operations  as  well,  but  under  Virgin’s  investment  model  they  
didn’t  have  to.  We  have  two  other  airlines,  Virgin  Express  in   Brussels and Virgin Blue in Brisbane, 
Australia, both of which are separately run and publicly quoted. The effects of 11 September on these 
businesses were entirely different but equally challenging. In the case of one, it faced the collapse of 
the main st ate-owned carrier (Sabena), and the other the collapse of its main competitor (Ansett). Both 
have had to move quickly to reshape and grow their businesses. In each case they were able to focus 
completely on their own issues.  Similarly, Virgin Mobile faced challenges early in the twenty -first century: growth in the UK 
market, a recession in Singapore and the decision as to whether or not to press the button to expand in 
the US. If Virgin Mobile were one conglomerate there could have been paralysis in these d ecisions 
but, as each is under a separate joint -venture structure, once again the management teams could 
concentrate on the job in hand. By October, we took the momentous decision to go ahead with 
launching Virgin Mobile in the US in partnership with Sprin t, and began a fundraising exercise to help 
finance the $500 million venture.  
This was not as daft as it may seem. It was clear that the US economy was going into recession 
but what was also clear was that mobile -phone sales were finally starting to boom i n America after the 
uncertainties  that  followed  the  tragedy  of  11  September.  Virgin’s  low -cost model of prepaid phones 
seemed an ideal solution to help attract a youth market, one that had not warmed to mobiles and text 
messaging in the way that the Europe an, African and Asian youth markets had.  
Within another two weeks, on 7 October, the war against the terrorists started in earnest as the 
bombs  and  cruise  missiles  started  to  rain  down  on  their  enclaves  in  Afghanistan.  It’s  always  hard  to  
stay focused at t imes like these, as I knew from the first Gulf War, but people still had jobs to go to. 
So  it  was  another  shock  when  Virgin  Rail  Group’s  biggest  supplier,  Railtrack,  went  bust.  It  was  a  
blow to the railway -using public and to Virgin, which was at the time trying to negotiate a deal to save 
the upgrade of the West Coast mainline. Yet again, the consequences were quickly understood by a 
dedicated  management  team,  who  did  not  have  to  worry  about  the  rest  of  some  amorphous  plc’s  other  
activities.  
However, anoth er shock was to follow when the government pinched Richard Bowker to become 
head of the Strategic Rail Authority. As co -chairman of Virgin Rail, he had done a fantastic job in co -
ordinating our new train orders, as was proved when the first of our tilting trains were delivered from 
the  factory,  on  time  and  to  budget,  in  November  2001.  By  way  of  contrast,  Railtrack’s  cost  for  the  
upgrade had gone up fourfold, and was going to end up being years late.  
It was a proud and tearful moment, standing in the Alstom factory in Birmingham on a cold and 
sunny November day, watching Joan name one of our new trains Virgin Lady . It was an even better 
moment sitting by the fire that evening watching the Six  O’Clock  News  and hearing the words I had 
waited  five  years  for:  ‘Vi rgin  has  delivered  on  its  promises.’  This  was  no  mean  feat,  as  the  orders  had  
been  placed  in  1998  and,  despite  all  the  technological  difficulties,  Virgin  had  produced  the  world’s  
most advanced train, which tilted round corners at speeds of up to 140mph (22 5 kph). Of course the 
sting in the tail was that the track would not be ready for 125 -mph operation until 2004!  
The  winter  of  2001  saw  yet  more  midnight  oil  being  burned  by  Virgin  Rail’s  finance  team  as  they  
negotiated with Railtrack, its administrators, t he Strategic Rail Authority, the Department of Transport 
and the train suppliers to ensure that our trains got the track they deserve – and the public the service it 
deserves. I thought how ironic it was that every critic of our deal to upgrade the railway  in 1997 had 
predicted that we would never get the new trains to work and that we would go bust in the process of 
trying.  As  it  was,  about  the  only  tangible  successes  of  privatisation  were  Virgin’s  electric  Pendolinos  
and diesel Voyagers. The railway exper ts who had also predicted in 1997 that upgrading the track 
would be easier than the trains were dumbfounded.  Meanwhile, in Australia, the effects of 11 September continued to be felt in the airline business. 
Following the collapse of Ansett, Virgin Blue su ddenly  found  itself  Australia’s  second -largest airline. 
Its chief executive, Brett Godfrey, had been steadily building the business for a year but almost 
overnight was running an airline that promised to be more profitable than easyJet and had enormous 
opportunities, if only he could raise the finance. Our corporate finance director, Patrick McCall, was 
on a plane to Australia within three days of the Twin Towers attack. One month later Virgin Blue had 
announced the appointment of Goldman Sachs to prepare f or a flotation in 2003 with a potential 
valuation being talked about of over AUS$1 billion.  
It  nearly  did  not  turn  out  this  way  as  Ansett’s  parent  company,  Air  New  Zealand,  had  made  an  
offer to buy Virgin Blue for US$250 million shortly before 11 September . Our friends at Singapore 
Airlines had a 20 per cent stake in ANZ, so it was the CEO, Dr Cheong (CK), who telephoned me to 
make  the  offer.  ‘Richard,  I  really  think  you  should  accept  this  offer,’  he  said.  ‘It  is  a  very  generous  
valuation  and  if  you  don’t  t ake  it  we’ll  put  the  money  into  Ansett  instead,  and  they  will  wipe  out  
Virgin  Blue  within  six  months.’  Was  he  bluffing?  
It was a difficult decision. My instinct told me that the company was worth more than that, but it 
wasn’t  an  ungenerous  offer.  However,   there  was  something  in  the  desperate  insistence  in  CK’s  voice  
on the long -distance phone line that made me hesitate. I decided to be a little mischievous, and to call 
a press conference. I wanted the competition authorities to understand how strongly the p ublic felt 
about  the  need  for  healthy  competition.  I  announced,  with  a  sombre  and  straight  face:  ‘This  is  a  sad  
day,  but  I’ve  decided  to  sell  up.  This  means  that  cheap  air  tickets  in  Australia  will  be  a  thing  of  the  
past – others  won’t  want  to  follow  what   we tried to do. It will, of course, mean that our staff will be 
part  of  Ansett,  and  that  there  will  be  redundancies.  But,  anyway,  I’ve  done  well  out  of  it,  so  I’m  off  
back  to  the  UK  right  away  with  my  $250  million  profit.’  There  was  a  deadly  hush,  and  the   packed 
room seemed in deep shock. A journalist from the Press Association rushed off to file her copy. And 
then I caught sight of some of our staff across the room, who were not meant to be at the press 
conference.  I  realised  they  were  in  tears.  ‘Only  joki ng,’  I  added  quickly,  and  publicly  tore  up  the  
US$250 million cheque.  
Five days later, Ansett went bust and Brett could barely contain himself on the phone as he 
enthusiastically outlined his plans for rapid expansion of what had become, overnight, Austral ia’s  
second -largest  airline.  It  was  that  call  that  made  me  realise  that  Brett’s  team  had  built  a  truly  Virgin  
business: it had revolutionised the market for Australian air travel; it had built a fantastic reputation 
for quality; and all this had been done as a small -scale, venture -capital start -up, with only AUS$10 
million.  
By December 2003 this AUS$10m start -up had captured over 30 per cent of the market and was 
the first of our new generation of companies to float. This was a remarkable achievement given the 
chaos in the aviation market and the tragic terrorist attack in Bali the previous year, which had dented 
Australians’  confidence  in  their  immunity  from  the  problems  of  the  rest  of  the  world.  By  the  time  we  
took the company public on the Australian stoc k market we had a new partner in Virgin Blue called 
Chris Corrigan, and, with his investment and the float, we had made over $780m in just over three 
years of trading. After the float Virgin retained a 25 per cent stake and the company continued to 
prosper  for over eighteen months until Qantas finally woke up to the destruction of their domestic 
market and, like all good monopolists, they launched a low -quality clone of Virgin Blue in the spring 
of 2004 called JetStar. By January 2005 Virgin Blue was locked  in a price war. Despite this, Virgin Blue  is  still  one  of  the  world’s  most  profitable  airlines.  Indeed,  one  of  the  remarkable  achievements  of  
2004 –5 was that Virgin Blue and Virgin Atlantic both remained profitable at a time when most of the 
US airlines f inally went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  
Even our newer dotcom businesses – those launched since 1998 – seemed to go from strength to 
strength after 11 September, largely because they were modelled on a real brand, selling real things. 
Virgin Cars sold its six thousandth vehicle that winter and, despite a blip after the New York attacks, 
car sales actually improved in the run -up to Christmas. The same was true of thetrainline.com . Again, 
sales rocketed as nervous execu tives decided that a train from Manchester or Newcastle was a better 
bet than a plane. By the beginning of 2002 these and several other of our e -commerce businesses had 
turned cash -flow-positive. There was only one exception, Virgin Wines, which, despite w inning 
100,000 customers, still could not get the margins it needed in a cut -throat  market;;  but  we’re  confident  
that it will turn the corner soon enough.  
Virgin Wines was a good example of our management philosophy of giving our people the 
chance to become  entrepreneurs in their own right. Rowan Gormley, of Virgin Money, had begun to 
feel by the end of 1999 that our financial -services business was maturing and needed a different sort 
of manager. The former venture capitalist had been bitten by the entrepren eurial bug and simply 
wanted to start something new – an online wine retailer. I sympathised with him and, in spite of our 
misgivings about entering such a different sector, we decided to back him almost as a matter of 
principle. Virgin Wines was establish ed as a joint venture by Virgin and Rowan.  
I could go on, but hopefully the point is well made. By investing in separate businesses with 
partners – ‘ring-fenced’,   as   the   bankers   keep   telling   me   – we had been able to withstand the 
management pressures of 11  September, spread risk and take what we hope have been a lot of good 
decisions. Couple these with a venture -capital private -equity model of creating individual companies 
with their own business case, shareholders and financial resources, and you have the Virgin that 
existed in 2001, and continues to exist now.  
It’s  been  interesting,  with  the  collapse  of  Enron,  to  see  how  people  still  want  to  build  enormous  
companies; but if something major goes wrong the whole lot falls. What we are trying to do at Virgin 
is not to have one enormous company in one sector under one banner, but to have two hundred or even 
three hundred separate companies. Each company can stand on its own feet and, in that way, although 
we’ve  got  a  brand  that  links  them,  if  we  were  to  have  an other tragedy such as that of 11 September – 
which hurt the airline industry – it  would  not  bring  the  whole  group  crashing  down.  So  we’ve  
managed to avoid the danger that we might wake up one day with one awful thing going wrong that 
threatens to bring all  the companies down.  
As  it  turns  out,  we’ve  never  let  a  company  go:  we’ve  always  paid  off  its  debts;;  we’ve  always  
managed to keep our reputation as an organisation that honours its obligations. But in the event of an 
absolute catastrophe we could let a com pany go; we could cut it out and, because of that, the rest of 
the  group  would  not  be  affected.  Obviously,  our  reputation  would  suffer,  and  we  wouldn’t  want  it  to  
happen, but at least it would avoid a disaster and the loss of 40,000 jobs.  
The sheer diversi ty  of  Virgin’s  businesses  has  proved  the  test  of  time  and  circumstance.  With  
each management team focused on its own business and entrepreneurial goals, we can achieve just 
about anything, as long as it is right for the brand. I had learned a lot in the la te 1990s and I had come to realise that sticking our name on products was not the best way to create value. Virgin Vodka might 
sell well on the planes and at the airports, but we did not have the worldwide distribution of firms such 
as UDV or Scottish Cour age to back it up. However, find entrepreneurial managers like Frank Reed 
and Matthew Bucknall at Virgin Active, and give them the resources, and the sky will be the limit.  
The omens were not good when Virgin Active opened its first club in Preston, Lancas hire, in 
August  1999.  A  fire  swept  through  the  club,  doing  tens  of  thousands  of  pounds’  worth  of  damage,  and  
a distraught Frank phoned me to give me the bad news. However, one can often turn bad news into 
good news. When he said it would give them a chance  to do one or two things differently and have 
longer to train the staff, I was relieved. I was also beginning to get the measure of why Frank had such 
a strong reputation in the leisure industry.  
At the same time, Frank helped me fulfil a pledge of many ye ars’  standing  to  invest  in  South  
Africa. One of the first casualties of the stock -market decline that preceded the Twin Towers attack 
was  a  quoted  South  African  company  that  happened  to  own  the  country’s  largest  chain  of  health  clubs.  
I was in the bath whe n Nelson Mandela called, and explained that it would be a particular blow to 
have eighty health clubs owned through a black -empowerment scheme closed down with the loss of 
several  thousand  jobs.  He  asked  whether  we  could  rescue  it,  and  save  those  people’s   livelihoods. We 
could, and we did, so that, by the end of 2001, Virgin Active had mushroomed through growth and 
acquisitions into one of the top five health -club operators in the world.  
In the years that followed, Virgin Active became one of the silent suc cess stories of the Virgin 
empire. Even internally very few people knew how well it was doing. We brought venture -capital 
partners into the business and, by the beginning of 2005, it was making a profit of £34m a year.  
Our method of expansion through brand ed venture capital may not suit everyone, but it is 
heartening to see that one entrepreneur is now following a not -too-dissimilar model. EasyJet has been 
so successful that it now has a stock -market quote and its entrepreneurial founder, Stelios Haji -
Ioann ou, is developing new businesses using the same brand, such as easyCar, through his separate 
private venture -capital vehicle easyGroup.  
In the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September, Virgin Atlantic has completely restructured its 
operations,   whilst   BA’s   main   response   was   to   wrap   itself   in   the   Union   Jack   and   pursue   the  
government to back yet another attempt for it to create a transatlant ic monopoly with American 
Airlines. Instead of trying to prevent more than 60 per cent of UK –US airline traffic and slots at 
Heathrow from falling into the hands of one monolithic structure, it was clear that the British 
Department of Transport was going t o help!  
On a warm and sunny November day in Washington, while I was presenting our case against the 
deal  in  front  of  the  Senate,  the  transport  department’s  hypocrisy  was  brought  home  to  me.  The  British  
Embassy put out a press release supporting the merger,  and  an  attendant  ‘Open  Skies’  deal   – amazing 
considering the only beneficiaries were likely to be the two airlines creating the monopoly. With 
considerable pomposity, our diplomats tried to capture the pro -British mood on Capitol Hill with the 
words,  ‘Two  allies, united in so much else, should be able to reach agreement on something that 
would  be  to  their  mutual  benefit.’  If  anyone  could  have  told  me  what  ‘mutual  benefit’  the  attempt  to  
create a North Atlantic airline monopoly had for two allies locked in conflict with the Taliban and 
Osama Bin Laden, I would happily have given them a free Upper Class ticket for life.  That was not the end of it, though. In trying to defend the deal, BA made the ludicrous claim in 
the Sunday Telegraph  that there was no short age of slots at Heathrow; this was, in the immortal words 
of  Sid  Vicious,  ‘bollocks’!  Virgin  responded  by  offering  to  give  £2  million  to  charity  for  every  slot  
that Lord Marshall managed to procure for us. Naturally, he was unable to rise to the challenge,  and he 
must have groaned when the United States Department of Justice slammed the deal as anti -
competitive and confirmed that its investigations concluded that the shortage of slots was a major 
reason why the deal should not go ahead as proposed.  
It was n ot  until  late  January  2002  that  BA’s  game  with  American  Airlines  finally  played  itself  
out. The US Department of Transport announced that it would let the two monopolists merge their 
operations if BA gave up slots to the other American carriers. The proble m was the price: the US 
regulators realised that Heathrow was overcrowded and that they would have to give their airlines a lot 
of access as the price of the deal. For BA, though, the price was too high; in the last week of January 
they abandoned their mer ger  plans  and  went  back  to  the  drawing  board  on  the  whole  ‘Open  Skies’  
issue. 
Since the start of their attempted merger in 1996, BA had wasted thousands of man -hours, not to 
mention tens of millions of pounds, on a hopeless scheme, more in tune with the 19 70s view of the 
airline business than the modern world of deregulation, competition and low -cost airlines. Rod 
Eddington wisely bit the bullet and, instead of trying to create a monopoly to get out of difficulties, 
announced  the  ‘Future  Size  and  Shape’  pro ject to restructure BA.  
One  of  the  things  I’ve  learned  over  my  years  in  business  is  that,  once  you  have  a  great  product,  it  is  
essential   to   protect   its   reputation   with   vigilance.   It’s   not   just   a   question   of   getting   it   into   the  
marketplace. As a result, eve ry day I receive a bundle of press cuttings – everything that mentions 
Virgin. These – and staff letters – are the first things I read in the morning. When I launched the 
airline, I realised that I would have to use myself to raise the profile of Virgin At lantic and build the 
value  of  the  brand.  Most  companies  don’t  acknowledge  the  press  and  have  a  tiny  press  office  tucked  
away out of sight. If an inaccurate story appears in the press and is allowed to run for more than one 
issue of the paper, it becomes fa ct. Then, every time your product is mentioned, this same story will be 
repeated.  
My reputation has been threatened on two major occasions – first  by  British  Airways,  which  I’ve  
covered in detail, and second by Guy Snowden and his company GTECH, the drivin g force behind the 
creation of Camelot, which won the franchise to run the British National Lottery. For both companies 
I was a spanner in the works, costing them millions of pounds in lost earnings.  
The GTECH incident was a particularly crucial one in terms of reputation. I met Guy Snowden in 
1993 when the British Government had finally agreed to go ahead with the National Lottery. Various 
commercial consortia were beginning to form, but I felt strong ly that the Lottery should be run by a 
company that would donate all the profits to charity. This would be possible because it would be a 
monopoly with no risk involved at all. I had asked John Jackson, with whom I had worked on the 
Healthcare Foundation w hen he was chief executive of Body Shop, and with whom I had launched 
Mates condoms, to pull together our charitable bid. GTECH was the leading supplier of lottery 
equipment, so we thought that we should meet them to see whether they would be interested in  
supplying us in the event that their consortium failed to win the contract.  John Jackson and I met with Guy Snowden for lunch on 24 September. The conversation we had 
has since become the stuff of legal legend. After we reached a stalemate, in that Guy Sn owden  didn’t  
want  to  quote  for  supplying  equipment  to  us  and  I  didn’t  want  to  join  his  consortium,  there  was  a  
pause. Then Snowden pointed out to us that if we went ahead with our bid it would cost the GTECH 
consortium millions of pounds, since they would have to reduce the percentage they were going to 
charge as the operators from the 15 per cent of turnover mentioned in the government guidelines to 13 
per cent and possibly lower. Assuming that the annual sales of Lottery tickets reached £4 billion 
(which they  did),  each  percentage  reduction  of  the  operators’  slice  was  worth  £40  million  a  year.  
There was a great deal of money at stake.  
We were sitting in the conservatory in the garden at 11 Holland Park, and I noticed that Snowden 
began to sweat. He shifted  in his seat and looked at me.  
‘I  do  not  quite  know  how  to  phrase  this,  Richard.’  
I looked across at him, wondering what he was going to say.  
‘There’s  always  a  bottom  line.  I  will  get  to  the  point.  In  what  way  can  we  help  you,  Richard?’  
I  didn’t  know  what   to say. Snowden clarified his intentions.  
‘I  mean,  how  can  we  help  you  personally?’  
My mind reeled at the question. I was being offered a bribe.  
‘What  on  earth  do  you  mean?’  I  said,  astonished  and  angry  and  trying  to  give  him  the  chance  to  
stop. But he did n’t. 
‘Everybody  needs  something  in  life,’  Snowden  said.  
‘Thank  you,’  I  answered.  ‘I’m  quite  successful.  I  only  need  one  breakfast,  one  lunch  and  one  
dinner  a  day.  The  only  way  you  could  have  helped  was  by  providing  technical  services  for  our  bid.’  
And with  that  I  stood  up  and  left  the  conservatory.  I  wanted  no  further  part  in  this  man’s  world.  
While John and I were trying to pull together a bid for the National Lottery that was intended to give 
many millions of pounds to charity, this man was trying to brib e me to stand aside and enable his bid 
to go through, which, as well as giving less money to charity, would simultaneously enrich him and 
his company.  
I bounded down the stairs and into the loo. There I scribbled the words he had used on to a piece 
of pape r. I had never been offered a bribe before. Then I went back upstairs, and John and I ushered 
Snowden out of the house.  
‘I  wasn’t  mistaken,  was  I?’  I  asked  John.  ‘That  was  a  bribe,  wasn’t  it?’  
‘It  most  certainly  was,’  John  told  me.  Later, John told me how he nearly fell off his chair when Guy Snowden said those words. To cut 
a long story short, in the court case that ensued, the jury found in my favour against Guy Snowden and 
GTECH. In his summing -up, the late George Carman QC pointed out to the court that,  above any 
commercial  success  one  might  enjoy,  one’s  reputation  for  honesty  is  the  most  important  thing.  Guy  
Snowden  had  ‘picked  the  wrong  man,  said  the  wrong  thing,  in  the  wrong  place  at  the  wrong  time’.  
I decided in 1999 when the licence for the National  Lottery again came up for tender that I would 
bid once more with a not -for-profit consortium to take over the Lottery. I was convinced that New 
Labour’s   commitment  to   the  not -for-profit approach we had taken in 1993 would ultimately be 
honoured. As before , most of my close Virgin advisers tried to persuade me not to bid because of the 
risk to the brand that a fight with Camelot – which few of them believed we could win – could do. 
Nonetheless, I felt so passionately about this that I decided to go ahead, a nd kicked things off by 
picking up the phone to my old friend Simon Burridge. He had spent the intervening years at the J 
Walter Thompson advertising agency as managing director, but had lost none of his enthusiasm for 
either  the  principle  of  a  People’s  Lo ttery or the inevitable fight with Camelot that would follow the 
decision.  Simon  was  not  a  man  to  mince  words:  ‘I’ve  been  following  things  at  Camelot  very  closely,  
Richard, and all our predictions in the 1993 bid are coming true. Sales are falling like a s tone, the 
GTECH technology is crap, their games are unexciting and with the right suppliers I think we can do 
it!’ 
He set to work immediately and brought together everybody from Anne Leach and John Jackson 
right the way through to Colin Howes at Harbottle & Lewis. The only exception to the previous team 
was Will Whitehorn, who again felt strongly that there should be a clear demarcation between Virgin 
and  what  was  to  become  known  this  time  round  as  the  People’s  Lottery.  We  were  in  the  middle  of  
investing in  a whole new range of businesses, which, with the exception of the airline, might not see 
profits for the first couple of years. Will told me that he thought they would really go for the jugular 
and try to destroy my business reputation. He wanted to conce ntrate on fighting that bigger picture – 
the PR for the group and the brand – and suggested instead using an outside PR agency for the 
People’s  Lottery.  
And so we assembled a new team of suppliers, agencies and people, built around the core team 
from the 1 993 bid. In all, we ended up with more than twenty suppliers, from Energis and Microsoft to 
J Walter Thompson, JP Morgan and our previous rivals, AWI. Camelot, for its part, had brought in the 
Post Office as a shareholder to replace the now disgraced GTECH , although it still intended to bid 
with its equipment. Camelot had managed to improve one thing during their otherwise lacklustre six 
years: they had brought in the formidable Diane Thompson as chief executive. Diane was a good 
example of the new generati on  of  senior  female  executives  who  began  to  make  an  impact  on  Britain’s  
staid boardrooms in the 1990s. I relished the idea of a fight with her but, having heard her on BBC 
Radio  4’s  highly  respected   Today  programme several times, giving John Humphrys and J im Naughtie 
a run for their money, I knew she would not be a pushover.  
At the time, I was freshly back from our final, failed, round -the-world balloon attempt of 
Christmas  1998,  and  I  didn’t  appreciate  one  crucial  difference  between  the  Camelot  of  1993  and  that 
of 1999. Having won the bid to run the Lottery and run it for six years, they were prepared to do 
anything to keep it. More importantly, because most people thought they would win it again, we ended 
up being the only rival bidder, which meant they (a nd their friends) could concentrate all their 
firepower against us – and me personally.  The end game played itself out in the summer of 2000, while we were on our family holiday on 
Necker. A fax arrived from the boss of the Lottery Commission, Dame Helena Shovelton, telling us 
that we had not won, but we had sort of won. We were given a period of exclusivity to negotiate a 
deal. If we could guarantee enough money to cover any potential downside and clear up a few points, 
then the Lottery would be ours.  
If only it had been that simple. Simon and John saw the danger signs fairly early on in the process 
and were right in predicting that Camelot could take a judicial review against her decision. They did. 
And,  what’s  more,  they  won  it,  which  then  threw  the  entir e process into chaos that autumn, with the 
danger of there being no time to hand over the Lottery to us. A very bitter Dame Helena resigned and 
was replaced by Terry Burns, a former Whitehall mandarin. In a few short weeks Burns reversed 
Dame  Helena’s  enti re approach to the Lottery, and came to the (I felt) ludicrous conclusion that the 
licence should go to Camelot.  
None of us could believe it and, as the weeks went on into 2001, it became clear that the British 
public could not believe it either: they bega n to desert Camelot in their thousands. By the time 11 
September shook the world, sales were falling at a rate of 20 per cent per year. I took no satisfaction 
from this, because, of course, it was not Camelot that suffered, but rather the many good causes – 
sport, the arts, charities and other organisations – that simply got less money.  
Camelot’s  new  licence  to  run  Britain’s  National  Lottery  came  into  effect  in  January  2002,  amid  
falling numbers of people playing. Diane Thompson, the chief executive, said t hat this was because 
people found it boring – how sad, that someone who has the job of making many millionaires a week 
can’t  make  it  exciting.  
It also emerged that Camelot had managed to win the renewal of their licence by pledging to 
raise £15 billion for  good  causes,  but  the  government  hadn’t  asked  them  to  guarantee  this.  Within  a  
week  of  winning,  Camelot  were  publicly  looking  for  excuses  as  to  why  they  wouldn’t  raise  anything  
like  £15  billion.  ‘We  were  distracted  by  the  bidding  process’  etc.  etc.  But  it   was too late. They had 
their licence. It was a staggering outcome and one for which I think the government should hang their 
heads in shame: they had pledged at the election that the Lottery would be run with all the profits 
going to good causes – and they ’d  reneged  on  that  pledge.  
* * *  
The restructuring of Virgin Atlantic after the tragedy of 11 September really began to pay off in the 
years that followed and the confidence of the management was if anything enhanced by the ability of 
the airline to withst and the shocks that followed – the after -effects of the war in Afghanistan and the 
double whammy the following year of SARS in Asia and a second war in the Gulf. Virgin Atlantic 
truly came of age during these events and managed to return to profitability a fter April 2002, despite 
having lost nearly £100 million in the months that followed the Twin Towers tragedy.  
We also launched our secret weapon in the so -called  ‘battle  of  the  beds’  with  British  Airways.  In  
the  summer  of  2003,  Virgin  Atlantic  unveiled  its  Upper  Class  Suite,  which  is  the  world’s  only  first  
class -style truly flat bed in a business class. It took of f in every sense of the word and the summer of 
2004 we were making significant in -roads  into  our  rivals’  market  share.  The project to create the beds had the usual Virgin characteristics. We took the brave move to 
design the unique product ourselves and th e  task  fell  to  Joe  Ferry,  Virgin  Atlantic’s  head  of  design.  He  
achieved the holy grail of airline seat manufacturers, which is to make a comfortable seat into a 
genuine  bed  through  its  unique  flipping  mechanism.  The  risk  paid  off,  and  Joe’s  design  won  six   of the 
world’s  biggest  industrial  design  awards  during  2004  and  had  the  effect  of  moving  thousands  of  
British Airways regular travellers to Virgin Atlantic.  
As  Virgin  Atlantic  continued  to  recover,  I  felt  a  great  deal  of  unease  about  the  ‘war  on  terror’.  I t 
had long been the desire of the so -called neo -conservatives in America to conduct a more 
interventionist  role  in  the  Middle  East  to  ‘stabilise’  that  region.  By  the  autumn  of  2002,  it  was  clear  
that the Bush administration had taken a decision to interven e in Iraq regardless of what world opinion 
thought of the matter and, by early 2003, it was clear they would do it even if the UN did not back 
their decision.  
I found the whole episode deeply depressing and had a real foreboding about what I believe was 
an unjustified invasion. Apart from the obvious human cost of a conflict, I was sceptical about the 
weapons of mass destruction and could not fathom why the US government would possibly find Iraq 
so easy to democratise when so many others had failed before. George Bush continued to state on 
television,  and  at  press  conferences,  that  ‘War  was  a  necessary  evil’   – it is my belief that most 
‘necessary  evils’  are  far  more  evil  than  necessary.  Though,  after  11  September,  Will  Whitehorn  had  
counselled us against pub lic opposition to the Bush administration over the issue of Iraq on the basis 
that  it  was  inevitable.  By  February  2003  I’d  hatched  a  personal  plan  to  try  and  persuade  Saddam  
Hussein to stand down before the dogs of war were unleashed. With a heavy heart I called Nelson 
Mandela and followed this with this simple letter.  
Dear Madiba  
As  always  it  was  very  good  to  talk  to  you.  I  thought  I’d  send  you  a  very  brief  note  setting  
out our discussion.  
America and Britain have definitely decided to go to war. Inevitabl y there will be many 
civilian casualties.  
I believe there may be only one way to stop a war in Iraq and I believe you may be the only 
person in the world to achieve it.  
If Saddam Hussein could be persuaded to retire to Libya (or somewhere else), with full 
immunity, I do not believe it would be possible for America to press ahead with war. If he were 
to make this sacrifice to avoid his people going through yet more sufferi ng he would enhance his 
reputation considerably. The personal alternative will be the fate of Noriega, Milosevic or worse.  
Knowing your close relationship with President Qaddafi and the respect you are held in in 
Iraq you are perhaps the only person who co uld organise this.  
I believe that you would have the credibility to persuade Saddam Hussein to step down. By 
flying out with you – to, say, Libya – he could leave with his head held high. It would be the best 
thing he could ever do for his people.  If it he lps you I would be happy to send you a plane to take you there and back (hopefully 
via Libya!).  
I’ll  talk  to  you  once  you’ve  spoken  with  Thabo.  
Kind regards as always  
Richard  
It was a bold plan that might just have worked. But time was running out.  
Nelson Mandela wanted me to get the approval of Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary 
General, and the blessing of his own President Thabo Mbeki. I wrote to Kofi Annan and followed up 
with a phone call. He gave the idea his full support. On 17 March we positio ned two pilots and a Lear 
Jet in Johannesburg to take Mandela to Baghdad. We had managed to get the hostages out of Iraq 
some years before by sending Edward Heath. This time Nelson Mandela – the  world’s  most  respected  
person – had spoken out strongly again st the upcoming US invasion. If anybody could persuade 
Saddam it would be him. Enormous numbers of lives could be saved and injuries avoided.  
Sadly time ran out and two days later events overtook us. On 19 March 2003 the US bombed 
Baghdad and the rest is h istory. There is nothing in my life that I regret more.  
But what I realised from this experience – and from friends with vision, like Peter Gabriel – is 
that the world needed a group of elders – such as Nelson Mandela – who could step in on behalf of the 
world community in situations like this. I decided that, over the next couple of years, I wanted to help 
bring  together  a  group  of  individuals  who  could  serve  as  global  ‘Elders’  to  deliver  a  voice  to  the  
people of the world.  
In late 2003 Joan, Holly, I and some of the team from Virgin also had the wonderful opportunity 
to  attend  and  help  organise  Madiba’s  ‘46664’  concert  in  South  Africa.  Madiba  was  generous  enough  
to use his prison number, 46664, as a symbol for hope in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Sitting ne xt to 
him  and  his  wonderful  wife  while  listening  to  Peter  Gabriel  sing  ‘Biko’  for  the  first  time  in  South  
Africa was one of the most moving experiences of my life.  
Before this concert, but not long after the war was over, I saw a microcosm of Iraq first ha nd 
when we took the first relief flight into Basra. Appropriately, it was piloted by Mike Abunalla, an Iraqi 
exile whose family had fled Iraq twenty -two years earlier. Our mission was to deliver over 60 tons of 
generously donated medical supplies to the ho spitals  of  Basra  which  Saddam’s  army  had  stripped  bare  
in their rush northwards. During the flight we were all struck by the devastation of any infrastructure 
on the ground and the sheer emptiness and enormity of the country.  
The whole project had been a r emarkable co -operation between an Iraqi exile, Luay Shakarchy, 
who was based in the Midlands, in Birmingham, our own Jackie McQuillan and Air Marshal Brian 
Burridge. The spirit of co -operation between the British forces on the ground in Basra and a small 
team of operational staff from Virgin Atlantic was remarkable; in a matter of weeks they managed to 
open Basra Airport for a 747, getting this much needed aid into the country. I spent a lot of time 
talking to the servicemen and women in Basra and I could t ell that many of the British forces had a strong sense of foreboding regarding the situation unfolding with their American counterparts in the 
north of the country. How true that sense of foreboding turned out to be.  
Many of us were moved by what we saw an d experienced during this first civilian flight into Iraq 
since 1990. Not least Jackie who, joined by three Iraqi exiles who are now doctors in Britain, went 
downtown to visit some of the patients in Basra General Hospital. It was there she saw first hand not 
only the pain and suffering inflicted on civilians during war, but also the fact that there is always hope 
and beauty no matter how horrific the situation. In the hospital she met a young woman of twenty who 
had been severely wounded in the legs and st omach by shrapnel. Despite her agony, she could not 
drag her eyes away from her beautiful little baby girl, who had been born by emergency caesarean 
section  two  days  before.  Seeing  Jackie’s  tears  of  sympathy  the  woman  said:  ‘Please  don’t  cry  for  me,  
God ha s  given  me  the  greatest  gift  of  all  and  in  her  eyes  is  only  innocence  and  love.’  They  were  some  
of the most poignant words relayed to me that day.  
The Pentagon suggested that the cost of the conflict in Iraq would be approximately $75 billion 
per year over  ten years. In accepting the Niwano Peace Prize on 8 May 2003, Dr Priscilla Elworthy, of 
the   Oxford   Research   Group,   said,   ‘We   must   compare   this   $75   billion   to   the   costs   of   building  
international security in other ways.  
‘(a)  In  the  year  2000  world  leaders  e stimated that it would require $25 billion to $35 billion 
annually to raise levels of health and welfare in Africa to Western standards.  
‘(b)  Unesco  estimate  that  all  the  world’s  children  could  be  educated  if  we  were  to  spend  $7  
billion dollars per year fo r ten years.  
‘(c)  Clear  water  and  sanitation  could  be  provided  for  everyone  in  the  world  for  $9  billion  
annually.  
‘(d)  HIV  and  Aids  now  claim  5,500  lives  a  day  around  the  world   – more than the Black Death – 
and twelve million children in Africa have been o rphaned by the disease. Kofi Annan has called for 
$10 billion annually to address the Aids epidemic.  
‘So  all  these  goals  could  be  reached,  all  this  suffering  prevented  worldwide  for  less  than  the  
United  States  spends  on  military  action  in  Iraq.’  
However, she ended on a positive note by quoting Dr Müller, the Chancellor of the University of 
Peace in Costa Rica, and the Dalai Lama.  
‘Dr  Müller,  in  a  speech  earlier  this  year,  said,  “I’m  so  honoured  to  be  alive  at  such  a  miraculous  
time  in  history.  I’m  so  moved  by  what’s  going  on  in  our  world  today.  Never  before  in  the  history  of  
the world has there been a global, visible, public, viable, open dialogue and conversation about the 
very legitimacy of war. What will be the consequences? The costs? What migh t be the peaceful 
alternatives? What kind of negotiations are we not thinking of? What are the real intentions of 
declaring  war?”  
‘Many  millions  of  people  in  the  world  seem  to  have  found  a  new  voice.  Maybe  some  good  may  
emerge from the decision to invade I raq after all.  ‘And  finally  the  beautiful  quotation  purportedly  from  the  Dalai  Lama:  “If  you  wish  to  experience  
peace, provide peace for another. If you wish to know that you are safe, cause others to know that they 
are safe. If you wish to better understa nd seemingly incomprehensible things, help another to better 
understand. If you wish to heal your own sadness or anger, seek to heal the sadness or anger of 
another.  
‘“Those  others  are  watching  for  you  now.  They  are  looking  to  you  for  guidance,  for  help,  f or 
courage, for strength, for understanding and for assurance at this hour. Most of all – they are looking 
to  you  for  love.”’  
Back in London in the spring of 2004, it was business as usual in the Virgin empire. Gordon 
McCallum, previously Group Strategy Di rector for the Virgin Group, was busy preparing Virgin 
Mobile for its flotation on the London Stock Market with an expected valuation of £1 billion. It really 
had  been  a  remarkable  story.  In  only  four  years  we  had  created  the  world’s  first  virtual  mobile -phone 
network and established a base of 4 million customers who were the most satisfied in the industry. 
Even more exciting, in some ways, was the huge success of the US mobile venture, which we had 
started in the dark days of post -11 September America. Eve n by 2004, it was clear that Virgin Mobile 
USA could eventually be more valuable than the UK operation. It had become the fastest -growing 
company in the history of corporate America to reach a billion dollars and had done so in under three 
years. Hot on th e heels of the US, other colleagues, Robert Samuelson and Max Kelly, were beavering 
away in Canada recruiting the team for yet another mobile venture to launch there in 2005 in 
partnership with Bell Canada. By mid -2004, it was becoming obvious that the mod el really worked 
and  we  could  provide  a  better  deal  for  consumers,  through  leveraging  our  brand  off  other  networks’  
excess capacity. As the year drew on, more and more opportunities began to pop up in places as 
diverse as Africa and China.  
In July of that year Virgin Mobile UK floated on the stockmarket. In the five years since the 
company had started, it had become a major force in the UK mobile industry, gathering over 4 million 
customers and becoming one of the most profitable companies in the industry b ased on its simple and 
cheap  ‘virtual  network’  model.  As  usual  our  timing  was  impeccable!  The  stockmarket  was  the  worst  it  
had been since 11 September and flotations were getting pulled on a daily basis on both sides of the 
Atlantic. To add insult to injur y, the only other company floating on the stockmarket in Britain at the 
time  was  the  manufacturer  of  Branston’s  pickle   – so  it  won’t  take  much  for  you  to  imagine  the  
headlines that accompanied our dilemma on whether or not to float Virgin Mobile. I was on holiday 
on Necker when we took the final decision to go ahead at a reduced price of £2 per share. The 
psychology was very important to us in that the Virgin Group had once been quoted on the 
stockmarket in Britain and we had always said that, if we came ba ck, it would be with a single 
company  focused  on  a  particular  business.  I’m  glad  to  say  that,  in  the  winter  of  2004,  the  Virgin  
Mobile shares went from strength to strength. This has resulted in a huge amount of interest in our US 
mobile business and propo sals to float it, which we did in late 2007, with a share price of $15. Two 
thousand and five was also the year that we began to take the mobile concept around the world on the 
back of the success of the UK, Australia and the USA. The first big new mobile launch was in Canada 
in the spring with South Africa to follow in the winter and deals being done for launches in China, 
India and other parts of Africa.  
Not only had the successful flotation of Virgin Mobile allowed us to consider indulging in riskier 
projects such as space travel, but it also gave us the chance to try out one or two fun sponsorships of the  type  that  Virgin  had  not  been  able  to  do  since  11  September.  Steve  Fossett’s  Virgin  Atlantic  
Global Flyer was only one of these. In early 2005 we agree d to back a unique archaeological project to 
survey ancient Alexandria using the latest geophysical equipment – a georadar. Many important 
historical buildings, such as the tomb of Alexander the Great, the Great Library and Ptolemaic Royal 
Palace, have lai n hidden and undiscovered somewhere under the city of Alexandria since late Roman 
times when an earthquake destroyed the whole area. It felt like old times for me as Martyn Gregory, 
with  whom  I  had  become  a  friend  since  he  had  written  his  book  about  BA’s  d irty tricks and another, 
Diana, The Last Days , on the death of my friend Princess Diana, presented the idea. He had credible 
research behind his belief that a group of young archaeologists could unmask the secrets that lie below 
the modern city using groun d-penetrating radar. It would take until 2006 to find out whether he was 
right and if we would be part of the greatest archaeological discovery of all time or yet another 
forgotten sponsor of an ill -fated expedition to find one of the wonders of the ancien t world.  
Despite 11 September, we did not ignore the airline industry where it was clear there were still 
opportunities to create really exciting businesses. By the summer of 2004, Fred Reid, who used to run 
Delta Airlines, was recruited to lead one of Vir gin’s  boldest  moves  in  its  35 -year history – an all -out 
assault on the bankrupt US domestic air -travel market. Because of the historic protectionism of the US 
domestic market I would have to play a relatively minor role in the creation of Virgin America as  an 
airline, with the majority of the funding and the management coming from US institutions and 
companies. It was, therefore, bizarre – but deeply satisfying – to wake up one morning in May 2004 to 
read that my new airline was going to be called Virgin Am erica. For me, Virgin had come of age. We 
had  the  confidence  to  invest  in  the  world’s  toughest  aviation  market  and  be  prepared  to  not  have  full  
control  of  the  company’s  destiny.  The  very  rules  that  had  made  the  US  such  a  barrier  to  entry  to  us  in  
the past and which BA had tried to use to seal a monopoly, no longer held any fear for us. Over the 
years we had witnessed some of the most anti -consumer and monopolistic practices by the big US 
carriers. It finally appeared that the tables were turning. But for so me the desire to keep the barriers up 
to new players within this underserved market is still great. In July 2004 I received a letter from a 
friend who had attended the ACTC Aviation Conference in Washington. In attendance at this event 
were the chief execu tive officers of the leading five American carriers. During the meeting one of 
these  gentlemen  was  heard  to  remark:  ‘All  we  need  now  is  Branson  and  the  cookies  will  get  very  
burnt.’  This  sounds  vaguely  familiar.  If  not  flattering!  
However, it was not the n ew airline but another unique aviation event that took me back to 
America during mid summer that year. On a cold morning on 22 June 2004, I was fortunate enough to 
witness  one  of  the  most  amazing  sights  I  have  ever  seen  as  the  world’s  first  privately  funde d spaceship 
streaked into the skies above the little town of Mojave in the Californian desert. SpaceShipOne was 
the truly remarkable brainchild of Burt Rutan, a friend I had known for many years. Burt is one of the 
world’s  true  geniuses  and  his  designs  for  numerous aircraft had been groundbreaking for decades. He 
was already working with Steve Fossett and me on the Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer, a unique and 
beautiful  aircraft  that  we  were  planning  for  Steve  (or  myself,  if  he  got  ill)  to  attempt  the  world’s   first 
non-stop solo flight. The aircraft looked amazing, but not as amazing as the little spaceship I had seen 
hidden in the hangar earlier that year and was now streaking into space at 3,000 miles an hour above 
our heads in the desert.  
Another friend, Pau l  Allen,  who  is  one  of  the  founders  of  Microsoft,  had  funded  Burt’s  vision  of  
a cheap reusable spaceship for some years. Like Burt, Paul is a visionary. He was visibly excited as he 
watched his sci -fi  dream  unfold  and  become  tomorrow’s  reality.  Mike  Melvil le, an incredibly brave pilot, took the little spacecraft to 328,000 feet (100km) above the Earth. I watched with awe and 
realised that our own vision of cheap space tourism might finally be becoming a real possibility. At 
dinner with Burt and Paul the nig ht before, we had discussed the future of private space flight through 
a partnership with each other and I left the evening feeling uplifted. I had always felt that the 
government monopoly on space was a danger to mankind rather than the benefit often tout ed by 
cynical politicians and self -serving  missile  manufacturers.  Monopolies  don’t  work  in  any  industry  
whether  public  or  private.  Here  was  a  chance  for  Virgin  to  take  on  the  final  frontier.  I’m  sure  you  
won’t  be  surprised  that  we  had  registered  both  the  t rademark rights and a company for space travel ten 
years earlier – to be called Virgin Galactic Airways. The Virgin Group – ‘To  Infinity  and  Beyond’!  
‘You  must  be  joking,’  people  said  to  me.  ‘OK,’  I  responded,  ‘Virgin  Intergalactic  Airways!’  
All in all, 20 04 turned out to be a hugely important year for Virgin on every front. The Virgin 
Galactic joke became a very serious reality in September of that year. After months of intense 
negotiations Paul Allen agreed to sell the rights to the technology, which had made SpaceShipOne, to 
Virgin Galactic, which was officially born as a company on 15 September 2004. Within two weeks 
SpaceShipOne, carrying the Virgin banner, had completed two flights into space – the first -ever 
repeated private space flights – winning Bu rt and Paul the X -Prize, a US$10 million aviation incentive 
prize designed to jumpstart the space tourism industry. The media went wild and Burt rightfully took 
his place as an all -American hero. It was one of the proudest moments of my life to stand with Paul 
and Burt on a cool, still desert morning in Mojave to watch the second flight successfully completed. 
There was something about that day that just made you realise that we were watching history unfold 
and it reminded me of one of my favourite films of  all time: The Right Stuff . 
It  wasn’t  easy  to  persuade  my  level -headed colleagues at the Virgin Group of the sense in 
investing over $100m in building a spaceship. In fact, amusingly, I intercepted an email between some 
of  these  ‘level -headed’  colleagues  b y  mistake,  which  said  that  I  should  be  called  ‘Dr  Yes’  because  I  
said  ‘yes’  to  everything.  By  now,  Stephen  Murphy,  who  had  worked  for  Virgin  in  the  early  1990s  and  
had since returned to work with us again, had become the nearest thing that we had to a real  chief 
executive and, for the past three years, he had led a committee who scrutinised all of our investment 
decisions. When Will Whitehorn had to present them with the notion that I wanted to launch 
commercial space flights by 2008, they were just a littl e bit sceptical! Unless you have met Burt Rutan 
and understand his achievements, it would be hard for anyone to believe that a small group of 
buildings in the Mojave desert could possibly manufacture and safely fly a cheap private spacecraft. 
But, as the d eal to launch Virgin Galactic unfolded, so did the credibility of the project, and, by the 
beginning of 2005, even my hardheaded bean counters began to accept that the project was viable. As 
readers  of  this  book  will  know,  I’ve  often  been  accused  of  talkin g ahead of myself, but I do believe 
that  in  the  near  future  we  will  be  taking  the  world’s  first  private  astronauts  regularly  into  space  both  
safely and for $200,000 or less each.  
The  unique  features  of  Burt’s  spaceships  that  give  me  so  much  confidence  are   the safety of both 
his rocket motor and his feathering device for re -entry  into  the  Earth’s  atmosphere.  In  both  cases  his  
genius  has  been  to  take  very  old  ideas  and  apply  modern  technology  to  them.  Let’s  start  with  his  
rocket motor. It is unique in that it  burns laughing gas and rubber; by themselves both inert, put them 
together  and  you’ve  got  a  perfectly  credible  rocket  motor,  which  is  also  much  safer  than  the  highly  
combustible liquid -fuelled rockets of NASA. One cynic did point out that, if anything eve r happened 
up  in  space,  at  least  we’d  die  laughing.  The other feature turns the spaceship from a streamlined supersonic craft into the equivalent of a 
sycamore leaf or shuttlecock whilst in space. This allows the craft to re -enter  the  Earth’s  atmosphere  
much more slowly than a space shuttle would, which removes the risk of overheating.  
The  final  feature  of  Burt’s  design  is  his  use  of  plastic  and  what  are  called  composite  materials;;  
neither the mother ship that launches his spaceship nor the spaceship itself  are built of metal, but 
instead use new heat -resistant materials that are lighter and safer than aluminium or steel. The net 
result is a spaceship launch mechanism that is safe, cheap and environmentally friendly. To have the 
same impact on the environmen t as one space -shuttle launch would require many tens of thousands of 
launches by our spaceship. This means that the vision of millions of people – that they may one day be 
able to visit the stars – can  finally  be  realised.  However,  this  won’t  be  true  of  J oan Branson, who has 
not volunteered for the first flight, despite the fact that both my mum and dad and Holly and Sam all 
want to go. I suppose I should hardly be surprised as Joan still crushes my hand every time we fly 
anywhere together. My dad will be in his nineties when he flies. When asked whether he was worried 
about going into space, he responded by saying that, given his age, that was the least of his worries.  
If  my  confidence  in  Burt  Rutan’s  unique  status  as  the  Einstein  of  aerodynamics  needed  an y 
reinforcing  as  we  geared  up  to  build  the  world’s  first  truly  commercial  spaceship,  it  happened  at  the  
end of February 2005. When Steve Fossett had approached me in 2002 to be his back -up pilot in case 
of illness I readily agreed, and was equally pleased to fund and manage the building and flying of the 
world’s  first  high -altitude global circumnavigation aircraft. We could not have dreamed that three 
years later the project would also have produced one of the most extraordinarily beautiful aircraft ever 
built,  the  Virgin  Atlantic  Global  Flyer.  It  was  Steve’s  ambition  to  fly  it  solo  around  the  world  in  less  
than eighty hours, using a combination of one of the most efficient aircraft designs ever built and Burt 
Rutan’s  legendary  ability  to  build  large  composi te aircraft not containing any metal.  
It was a freezing evening on Monday 28 February when Steve Fossett took off from Salina, 
Kansas, to attempt his heroic flight. The aircraft looked magnificent as it trundled down the runway 
with 18,000lbs of fuel on bo ard out of a total weight of little over 21,000lbs. Thousands watched the 
take-off and all of our hearts were in our mouths for ten seconds when, having lifted off, Steve drifted 
back down towards the runway, but, before the fatal moment that we all saw in  our  mind’s  eye,  he  
swooped away like a beautiful swallow into the night skies of the Midwest.  
I followed him up for the first few hours in the chase plane, and was due to be dropped in 
Toronto by Will and the team in order that I could launch Virgin Mobil e the next day in Canada. As 
we headed into a freezing blizzard, it was clear that all was not well with the plane: in the climb out 
from Kansas, Steve had definitely lost some fuel and there seemed to be a problem with his GPS 
system as he crossed the Can adian border. I was unceremoniously dumped on the tarmac by the chase 
plane team and left to head into Toronto not knowing if Steve was going to make it. But, like most 
things  at  Scaled  Composites  (Burt’s  company  in  the  Mojave  desert),  every  contingency  ha d been 
thought of, and over the next twenty -four  hours  John  Karkow,  Burt’s  brilliant  aircraft  designer,  
crunched the numbers and came to the conclusion that if the jetstream winds remained strong around 
the Earth then Steve could still make it. For sixty -seven hours Steve battled with the elements and, at 
one point, flew as high as 49,000 feet above the Earth in order to try and catch the best fuel efficiency 
and winds.  Having left Kansas in freezing, wintery conditions on the Monday night, he arrived back at the 
same  airport,  having  not  slept  or  landed  anywhere  on  the  planet’s  surface,  to  the  beautiful  sunshine  of  
a  spring  day.  It  was  one  of  the  happiest  moments  I’ve  ever  had  and,  even  though  I  hadn’t  participated  
in the attempt directly, I felt not only pr oud of Steve, but also a strange comradeship with his 
achievement – the  type  you  can  only  feel  if  you’ve  been  there  once  before  with  him.  
There was no doubt about the importance of his achievement. For Steve it was a world record 
but, as importantly for a major international airline, we had proved the point that you could build a 
light, highly efficient aircraft with no metal in its fuselage or wings and achieve sustained high -
altitude flight. The Global Flyer used less fuel per hour than an American four -wheel-drive truck. If 
the lessons of this flight could be transferred to civil aviation and become integral to the cultures of 
Boeing and Airbus, commercial flying could finally become the most environmentally friendly way to 
carry large numbers of people a round the planet.  
The future of the airline industry around the world also took a leap into the dark in January of 
2005  on  a  cold  clear  winter’s  morning  in  Toulouse.  It  takes  something  really  special  to  bring  a  British  
prime minister and a French president  together in the same place since relations between the two 
countries  haven’t  exactly  been  their  best  once  the  war  on  terrorism  began.  But,  that  morning,  I  was  
privileged to stand and watch Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac open the doors on the most amazing 
aircraft  I’d  ever  seen  in  my  life.  It  was  the  huge  Airbus  A380,  and  it  is  a  monster.  My  mind  slipped  to  
the movie I had watched only two days earlier called The Aviator , which was about the life story of 
American businessman Howard Hughes. This Airbus was t he first plane built that made his giant 
‘Spruce  Goose’  flying  boat  of  1946  look  small.  In  the  A380,  Airbus  had  built  the  world’s  largest -ever 
aircraft capable of carrying over 800 people, although Virgin loyalists will be pleased to hear that our 
version will only carry 550 – so there will finally be room for the double beds, gymnasium and casino 
that I have long wanted to put on long -haul flights. Unlike Howard Hughes, who never really had a 
market for his white elephant, I looked at the Airbus A380 with confidence. Knowing the history of 
the dirty tricks affair, readers will not be surprised to learn that most of these giant A380s are going to 
end up at Heathrow where, in 2005, BA still controlled nearly 50 per cent of the landing slots, and 
where anyone who has had to sit stacked up waiting to land will know just how precious they are.  
In the summer of 2004, I also brought myself one step closer to my dream of using the strength of the 
brand and our people to change the world for the better by launching a  new part of the group called 
Virgin Unite. This new organisation was built by Virgin staff around the world and will be a vehicle to 
pull us all together, hopefully to make a difference with some of the tougher social challenges facing 
us. Holly volunteer ed to spend whatever time she had during her final year at medical school to help 
out with sexual health issues facing young people in the UK – right back to where I started some forty 
years  ago  when  I  opened  the  Student  Help  Centre,  which  I’m  happy  to  say  is still providing free 
counselling on Portobello Road in West London.  
The run -up to the war and its aftermath did not hold back the Branson household. Holly had sailed 
through her A -levels and fulfilled her (almost) life -long ambition to go to university  to study 
medicine. She celebrated her twenty -first birthday and our son Sam his eighteenth. Though Sam 
perhaps  hasn’t  got  the  same  sense  of  purpose  at  school  as  Holly  had,  he  certainly  knows  how  to  party,  
and (perhaps taking after his father here) knows h ow to enjoy life to its full.  Joan and I were incredibly proud of how well Holly was getting on in her medical degree so we 
decided to throw a big party for her twenty -first. The weather was beautiful in Kidlington in 
Oxfordshire that cold November night and Holly looked lovely in her white evening gown. Joan and I 
had to pinch ourselves thinking back to the little baby girl who  we had brought back to our London 
houseboat  in  the  Regent’s  Canal  back  in  1984.  It  was  not  many  months  later  when  Sam  had  his  18th,  
which  was  a  considerably  more  ‘laddish’  affair  in  the  Roof  Gardens  in  Kensington.  To  say  that  his  
friends’  speeches  were  ri squé would be the understatement of the year. On this occasion Joan and I 
had to put our fingers in our ears, rather than pinch ourselves.  
Our day in Toulouse with the Airbus A380 has since brought my mind back time and time again 
to Howard Hughes and that  film and has made me realise just how slim the line is between genius and 
insanity and between determination and stubbornness. Yet again, I thank my lucky stars to have had 
the stability of a family around me during all the years of turmoil that Virgin ha s had to navigate 
without the balance sheet of a multinational corporation or the luxury of a cosy state monopoly. Poor 
old  Howard  Hughes  didn’t  really  have  anyone  he  could  turn  to  for  honest  advice  or  the  friends  and  
family whose wit, charm and wisdom can  so often help all of us in life to keep our feet on the ground 
while we look at the stars.  
I have also taken a conscious decision to spend more time with my parents, in particular my 
father, Ted, who is the eldest. Though they are both well into their eig hties, they are still on and off 
aeroplanes, travelling around the world. They have enormous affection for Africa, as do I, and in 1999 
we  bought  a  beautiful  game  reserve  called  Ulusaba  in  South  Africa,  where  we’ve  built  a  lovely  house  
up on the hill looki ng over the jungle. We run this as a business, but make sure that we all find the 
time to go and visit it ourselves. These are the times that you remember and cherish. Over the previous 
decades,  I  had  more  and  more  come  to  appreciate  Ted’s  wisdom.  One  exam ple had been his very wise 
counsel about the war in Iraq, which he had also been vehemently against, but on which he had also 
reinforced my own views – that, once the shooting started, we had to stand by and support the many 
brave young men and women from all  the  allied  countries  who  were  ‘following  orders’  in  Iraq.  
By the spring of 2004, Ted had fully recovered from a complex hip replacement operation a few 
years earlier and I took a short sabbatical from the world of Virgin to go camping with him in the 
Serengeti. It is an awesome place where you can really feel that nature is still in charge of her destiny. 
Having been there, I can fully understand why so many anthropologists believe the region is where 
man originated as a species. We spent ten days follo wing the wildebeest migration and the predation 
of the lions upon their herds. For those of you who have not spent ten days in a tent with your father – 
if you are fortunate enough to be in a position to do so – I can thoroughly recommend it in every way. 
I think we developed an even better understanding of each other as we talked long into the evening.  
More than anything, I marvelled at the sense of humour of a man who had seen it all! One 
fantastic  example  of  this  was  early  one  morning  on  his  birthday;;  we’d  all  just  woken  up  and  were  
quite grumpy after a night in the tent but Dad was beaming. We were al l  intrigued  until  he  said:  ‘If  I  
was  Catholic  I’d  be  doing  penance  today.  I  had  the  most  wonderful  dream.  It  involved  a  girl.’  
‘Did  you  misbehave  with  her?’  I  asked.  
Quick   as   a   flash   Dad   replied:   ‘I   don’t   know   what  you mean. Well I behaved. She was 
outrage ously  naughty!’  And  this  from  a  man  in  his  eighties!  There are many influences on my life that affect the way I feel about things. Ulusaba is one of them. 
Ulusaba  means  ‘Place  of  little  fear’  because  it’s  a  kind  of  rock  citadel  or  watchtower  rising  out  of   the 
jungle where the original warriors who lived there could make a stand when attacked by their enemies. 
To me, it is a place of great peace where I can sit around a campfire at night with my friends and 
family and listen to stories and make plans – just like the people of this ancient landscape have always 
done. 
I spend a lot of time in Africa and have been fortunate enough to get out into the jungle. I think 
there is nothing more beautiful in the world than being out there and seeing the early morning su nrise. 
The  air  feels  cleaner  than  anywhere  else  in  the  world  and  you’re  completely  in  touch  with  nature.  I  
remember one dawn when I was down in the river bed at Ulusaba and for a long time watched two 
three -month -old lion cubs playing with their enormous m other. When she got tired of them she picked 
them up in her teeth and went back into the thicket again. I marvelled at how gentle she could be. We 
continued on foot and soon saw the dominant leopard which has been in our game reserve for such a 
long time w e’ve  given  her  a  name   – Makwele. She was also playing with her young cubs as they ran 
up trees together, fell out of them and chased each other in circles. Their agility, grace and playfulness 
were astonishing.  
The first time I went to Ulusaba was when I w as in South Africa to open a Virgin Atlantic route 
to Cape Town in 1999. At the time, I was looking for somewhere very special in the bush and I was 
directed to the Sabi -Sand region. As we drove, massive rocks emerged dramatically from the bush, 
pushed out  by some ancient convulsion of the earth. Having chosen the area, we asked Mark 
Netherwood, a friend who used to run Necker Island, to work with us to create something dramatic 
and  beautiful  yet  unspoilt  out  of  the  jungle.  There’s  nothing  quite  like  Ulusab a in Africa. Rock Lodge 
is high on a rocky ridge with spectacular views of the jungle and game, while down in the river bed is 
Safari Lodge, which has a wonderful Robinson Crusoe walkway through the trees to a dam where 
hippos and crocodiles wallow. There is   so   much   game   in   this   region   of   Africa;;   you’re   almost  
guaranteed to see most species without going very far. You can get up early in the morning or in the 
evening  and  go  for  a  drive  or  even  walk  (with  a  guide!),  and  you’ll  always  find  things  to  see  and  
marvel at.  
As I write this, I can see giraffes walking by and elephants in the distance. I have a particular 
affection for the elephants because they are so intelligent and playful. The young ones are just like 
children or teenagers. They love a tree called  the marula, which bears a small red fruit that elephants 
find irresistible. Just this morning, I spent hours watching a young bull elephant shaking the tree to get 
at the fruit. They were falling like sweeties, just ready to be hoovered up. But at the poi nt at which he 
got a carpet of them ready to eat, his brother came along and tried to sneak in. They ended up having 
the  most  almighty  fight.  The  first  young  bull  seemed  to  roar,  ‘How  dare  you  take  my  sweeties!’   – just 
like any human being. Elephants will never damage their sweet shop – the marula tree – but their 
numbers are growing and they do great damage to other trees. People want to have the elephants 
culled. We have tried to come up with an idea to help the elephants in order to avoid culling and I 
noticed that nobody has actually replanted trees in the jungle. So, partly with our global warming hats 
on,  partly  to  avoid  the  need  to  cull  elephants  and  partly  to  create  jobs  for  Africans,  we’re  setting  up  
tree nurseries and will work hard at getting tree s replanted in the jungle. Many will be trampled or 
eaten by the elephants or giraffes, but some will survive.  For the past forty years I have worked hard at developing Virgin as a major global business. On 
the way, along with some great successes, there h ave been many challenges, tempered by fun, and for 
a long time it seemed enough. But, while I had always been aware of the need to be socially 
responsible, perhaps I am growing older and wiser because, gradually, I feel I should do much more, 
on a far wide r scale, to help people. Setting up Virgin Unite was part of the process of my 
development as a social entrepreneur. One of my first trips with Virgin Unite was to South Africa with 
Brad Pitt. With HIV/AIDS at the top of our agenda, we took Brad to visit s ome  of  the  ‘hospitals’  in  
different townships and in very rural areas. When we arrived at one hospital we saw that the walls 
were plastered with posters of competing undertakers. Inside, I was shocked when I saw hundreds of 
people who seemed to be almost r esigning themselves to dying from HIV/AIDS. People were waiting 
in the corridors for the beds of the dozens who had died the night before – it was like a conveyer belt 
of death. There seemed no end to the suffering because even the hospital workers appeare d to accept 
the  outcome  as  an  inevitable  part  of  ‘Africa’.  
The figures, which have been published for some years, but often ignored, have always seemed 
too big to be comprehensible, which I think makes a lot of people switch off. It is too much to accept 
when you read that 15,000 people are dying every single day from HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, most 
of them in sub -Saharan  Africa.  If  this  were  happening  in  the  UK  or  the  US,  we  wouldn’t  allow  it.  
I was outraged by this ridiculous situation. These diseases are treatable,  yet  they  aren’t  being  
treated. Africa seemed to have so many insurmountable issues – how could they be turned around at a 
greater speed? We were rather subdued when I took Brad to meet with Nelson Mandela at his home to 
discuss the 46664 AIDS ca mpaign, in which Mandela used his prison number to call on South 
Africans not to allow AIDS patients to be reduced to statistics. It is easy to ignore statistics because 
you can get information fatigue when too many figures are thrown at you. A lighter mom ent was when 
I  introduced  Brad  to  Mandela  by  saying,  ‘Brad  Pitt’s  in  film,’  and  Mandela  turned  to  Brad  and  said,  
with  a  twinkle,  ‘Oh,  what  kind  of  film  do  you  do?’  
Then, while Brad was posing next to Nelson Mandela for a picture, dressed in a 46664 T -shirt, 
someone said, sotto voce , how lucky the former president was because so many young ladies would 
give their eye teeth to be sitting where he was. Deliberately misunderstanding, Brad grinned and 
replied,  ‘So  many  young  men  as  well!’  
Later that day, we took  Brad to meet Taddy Bletcher, a man who single -handedly started up 
CIDA,  Africa’s  first  free  university,  in  downtown  Johannesburg.  Taddy  had  started  with  nothing,  but  
got the idea that, if he could be given an empty building and if he could keep the costs down by asking 
the students to run the school and do all the cooking, the cleaning and the administration, and if he 
could get businesses to lend their top staff to come and do the lecturing, then he could offer students a 
fully accredited business degree at almost no cost. Most Africans had never had the chance to have 
this kind of education because they are all from very poor rural areas or townships. Poor children from 
the townships or rural communities have never stood a chance to get their feet on the first rung of the 
ladder, but 1,600 students a year are now being educated through CIDA to degree standard for under 
$300 for the full course, including books and accommodation. I appreciated what Taddy was doing 
and we soon started working in partnership with CIDA, Love Life and Life College, three small social 
entrepreneur organisations, to build a graduate programme called Women on the Move. This helps 
young women with peer education and mentoring. Once they are educated, they go back into their 
communit ies and find thirty other young people who they then have to mentor and educate. In this way, we have started to build an army of people across South Africa who are being educated. Part of 
the rationale behind it is that they will spread a serious message of health education, much needed in 
Africa.  
Many things had collided and come together during that trip to make me want to put more effort 
into working towards change, but it was the visits to the hospitals and overcrowded orphanages that 
had the most impa ct on me. I decided then to devote a more significant part of my time – about 50 per 
cent – to social and environmental issues. I felt I had come a long way in my personal journey to 
Africa in the five years since I had found Ulusaba.  
My African journey ha d been one of many miles and many experiences. Death has always been a 
part of the landscape, and, while animals might stalk and kill each other in the jungle, there is no 
reason why so many Africans should die of preventable diseases.  
Some opportunities t o help come out of nowhere. I was returning from Africa on Virgin Atlantic 
one day and, as always, I strolled around, chatting to passengers. A lovely lady sitting in economy 
class met my eye, and smiled. She invited me to sit next to her for a moment. Her  name, she told me, 
was Marianne Haslegrave, and she was the Director of the Commonwealth Medical Trust. Little fazes 
me,  but  even  I  didn’t  expect  to  be  discussing  fistulas  with  her.  
She  spoke  to  me  about  fistula,  which  was  the  first  time  I’d  even  heard  of  it. Fistula happens, she 
told me, when very young girls – often as young as twelve and thirteen, as is the custom in some areas 
of countries such as Nigeria and Somalia – struggle to give birth without any assistance. A tear in the 
vagina wall – called a fistula – leads to permanent incontinence; consequently, these young women are 
divorced by their husbands and shunned by their families. Thanks to good maternity care, the last case 
of fistula in the US was in 1890, but it is still a common problem in Afri ca. 
Marianne has devoted her life to trying to help these girls. I knew I had to do something and 
asked Jean Oelwang, who runs Virgin Unite, to look into it. Jean went to the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) to see how we could help. This coincided n eatly with Natalie Imbruglia, 
who is a good friend, coming to me and saying she wanted to do something to help young women. I 
invited her and Jean to lunch and Natalie agreed to champion a campaign to promote the repairing of 
fistulas because no one else o f her stature was behind the issue.  
We took her out almost immediately to Ethiopia and Nigeria so she could see the problems for 
herself. At the same time, I put some money in and through the wonderful work and dedication of the 
team at the UNFPA, we did a  fistula fortnight in Nigeria, where, over a two -week period, 500 young 
women were repaired and we upgraded the hospitals. Since then, Natalie has worked tirelessly for her 
adopted project and I am proud of the way in which she rallied round when she was n eeded. The fact 
that she is a young, beautiful woman with an enormous talent who is willing to help such an 
unfashionable issue makes her a great role model. She also uses her music to promote fistula 
awareness and fundraising – and this gave us an idea to  launch the Music Movement, which is a 
community of musicians willing and able to get involved with tough social issues. Natalie told me that 
seeing  the  young  women  first  hand  was  one  of  the  saddest  journeys  she’s  been  on.  It  is  the  worst  thing  
that can ha ppen to them – many of them are just little girls, living as outcasts, shunned by the 
community. Some of them have lived in a hut at the back of their family house for twenty years or 
more. It is outrageous that this still happens when the problem can be r epaired so easily. It could be avoided with more birth control and fewer girls marrying so young, but it is difficult for us to impose 
our views on other cultures – but at least we are allowed in to help make things better and to provide 
education and help  improve the health infrastructure.  
I do try to be tactful, but sometimes you just have to speak your mind to make a point, as was the 
case when I went to speak to the US Senate towards the end of 2005, as part of a project to develop a 
coalition on HIV/AI DS.  On  the  way  there  in  the  taxi,  Jean  briefed  me:  ‘There  are  some  issues  with  the  
Bush  government  regarding  condoms.  They  have  committed  a  huge  amount  to  HIV/AIDS,  but  they’re  
unwilling  to  use  it  to  buy  condoms.’  
I  nodded.  ‘Yes,  I  see.’  
‘So  you  might  need  to  be  a  bit  careful  about  how  you  speak  about  this  at  the  Senate  today,’  Jean  
continued.  
As soon as she said that, I smiled.  
It was slightly surreal to be in the amazing Senate House, with all its history, and to be discussing 
sex.  Someone  used  the  word  ‘ grazing’  to  describe  how  HIV  could  be  spread  by  having  sex  with  
multiple partners – like a bee going from flower to flower. One of the Republican senators reared to 
his feet and declared that people should abstain from sex.  
I  stood  up  and  said,  ‘That’s  lov ely,  but  it’s  not  realistic.  People  are  going  to  graze   – but they 
should  wear  a  condom  when  they  graze.  No  glove,  no  love.’  I  could  feel  Jean  bring  her  hand  up  to  her  
face to hide a wide grin.  
I was hopping into a van outside the CIDA campus one afternoon,  having just met the wonderful Dalai 
Lama  for  the  first  time,  when,  out  of  the  blue,  Taddy  grabbed  me  on  the  pavement  and  said,  ‘Hey,  
Richard,  I’ve  got  a  great  idea.  Why  don’t  you  start  the  Branson  School  for  Entrepreneurship?’  
Taddy is an inspirational ma n and, when he speaks, you find yourself nodding in agreement. 
Inspired  by  his  almost  throwaway  words  in  the  street,  I  decided  I  would  set  up  my  first  ‘school’.  CIDA  
City Campus already provides specialised accredited business administration degrees to dis advantaged 
students, and I resolved that Virgin Unite would work with Taddy to launch a separate school at CIDA 
to help young people start their own businesses. One of the first things we wanted to do was to raise a 
seed fund, to be used as a kind of revol ving  loan  for  the  students’  enterprises.  As  soon  as  they  started  
to make money, they would repay the loan and, in that way, the fund would continue to work for those 
who followed behind.  
My model for this was Muhammad Yunus, who for some thirty years had s uccessfully been 
operating a micro -credit system for some of the poorest people in the world, through the Grameen 
Bank – known as the Poor Bank. He was first approached by a group of craftsmen in 1976 when he 
was a professor of economics in Bangladesh to l end them $27 to start a business. He did so, fully 
confident that they would pay him back – as  he  said,  ‘The  poorest  of  the  poor  have  a  great  sense  of  
responsibility.’  He  even  lends  to  55,000  beggars  under  a  Struggling  Members  Programme.  Professor  
Yunus’s  long-term vision is to eliminate poverty. So far, he has lent $1.5 billion to three -and-a-half 
million people, principally women, and has had very few defaulters.  Virgin Atlantic sponsors the Sunday Times  Fast Track initiative, which brings top entrepreneu rs 
together for dinner each year at my house in Oxford, to act as mentors to fledgling businesses. I 
auctioned off two spaces on our Wake Up Trips to Africa. Two British entrepreneurs, Tom Bloxam 
and Leo Caplan, bid £120,000 each to go with us. This launch ed  the  seed  fund  for  our  students’  
businesses, to help start them off in the world. Most people cut ribbons or break bottles of champagne 
when launching something new. Instead, along with Tom and Leo, in October, I found myself taking 
my shoes and socks of f and leaving my footprints in concrete at the entrance to the newly opened 
Branson School of Entrepreneurship. I felt quite emotional as I glanced at our footprints – which were 
supposed  to  inspire  the  students  to  ‘walk  in  the  footprints  of  global  entrepr eneurs’.  The  first  footprints  
of people were found in the clay of African shale beds. But, to me, the more important thing was that 
this very building at 27 Harrison Street was where Nelson Mandela had worked as a young man 
before his long years of impriso nment. His autobiography, written after he was freed, was titled Long 
Walk to Freedom ; the students would also have a long walk on their road to economic freedom against 
so many odds.  
Capitalism – which in its purest form is entrepreneurism even among the poorest of the poor – 
does work; but those who make money from it should put back into society, not just sit on it as if they 
are hatching eggs. Every single person at the Branson School soon had an idea to fill in a gap here, to 
fill in a gap there. Any o pportunity, they soon realised, is worth pursuing. Students will sell lollies, set 
up dealerships, be tour guides, open street cafés and restaurants – anything that will give them a leg up 
out  of  the  townships  and  slums.  I  often  pop  in  when  I’m  in  South  Af rica and I was both taken aback 
and moved once to find some of the kids had taken it upon themselves to fill in the holes in the road 
and then stand by the side of the road and see if anyone would be good enough to pay them for filling 
in holes. It was a g ood example of capitalism at work.  
When Sam reached the age of eighteen and left school, he thought he might take a gap year off and do 
some  travelling.  I  thought  it  was  a  great  idea  and  asked  if  I  could  tag  along  for  a  while.  I’d  been  
working pretty diligently since I was fifteen years old , not wanting to let people down, and missed out 
on  a  gap  year  of  my  own.  Fortunately,  we’re  the  kind  of  family  who  choose  to  go  on  holiday  together,  
rather  than  separately,  and  Sam  and  I  are  very  close,  so  it  wasn’t  a  matter  of  ‘getting  to  know  him’  but  
of having some fun together. I had to be in Australia for some meetings, and afterwards we headed off 
down the coast to Byron Bay, the most easterly point of the Australian mainland. We stayed in a flat 
above   Rae’s,   an   exotic   little   hotel,   more   Mediterranea n Moroccan than Alice Springs, right on 
Watego’s  Beach  and  went  for  a  walk  along  the  Cape  Byron  Lighthouse  track,  which  meanders  through  
some fabulous rainforest. As the forest opened out on to the headland, we saw a manta ray idly 
cruising along and a sma ll school of sharks.  
In the small town of Byron itself large groups of hippies roamed the wooden Western -style 
sidewalks. There were more head shops and bongo drum shops than in San Francisco and the haze of 
marijuana hung heavy in the air, like a time war p back into the Summer of Love.  
The first morning, we were up early and ran down to the beach with a couple of surfboards to 
‘catch  a  few  waves’.  Sam  and  his  friends  were  old  hands,  but  I  had  never  surfed  before.  I  could  kite  
surf and thought that surfing would not be hard. You just waited for a wave, climbed up on a board 
and  it  would  carry  you  along  to  shore.  The  first  day,  I  couldn’t  get  up.  The  second  day,  I  couldn’t  get  
up. My mind idly remembered the sharks out there beyond the headland.  ‘It’s  easy   – look,  you  do  this,  Richard,’  Sam’s  suntanned  friends  chortled  as  they  cruised  by  on  a  
long, curling wave.  
I was determined to crack it, but was still struggling on the third day when someone on the board 
next  to  me  said,  ‘Hey,  Richard,  two  guys  are  hiding   in  the  bushes  over  there  with  telephoto  lenses.’  
Instantly, ego got the better of me and, on the next wave, I got up, balanced like an old pro and 
sailed  smoothly  in.  It  was  like  riding  a  bicycle.  You  struggle  and  struggle,  then  suddenly  you’re  off  
and nev er look back.  
It was a perfect day, one of the very few times in my life when nothing seemed that important. I 
didn’t  make  phone  calls,  didn’t  think  about  a  thing.  I  was  out  on  the  waves,  with  not  a  care  in  the  
world. Such days are rare and all the more pr ecious for that. I remember when Holly was about five, 
the two of us went off for a week down to the fishing village of Bantham, in Devon, without Joan. It 
was a special week for both of us.  
Several years after successfully surfing that day, Sam and I drov e sixty miles up into the 
mountains together, goofing around, saying silly things, cracking bad jokes and laughing, more like 
two  best  friends  than  father  and  son.  We  were  so  exuberantly  happy,  we  didn’t  want  the  day  to  end.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 31 Changes  
2006  
MANY THINGS CAME  together in the summer of 2006 to make me focus on the two linked issues 
of global warming and rising fuel prices. I had first seen warning lights when the figures showed me 
that  Virgin’s  fuel  bill  was  rising  by  half  a  billion  dollars  a  yea r. 
As early as my teens, perhaps because of the influence of one of my relatives, Peter Scott, who 
founded the World Wildlife Fund, I was interested in the environment. I was drawn to the Gaia 
Theory, a hypothesis formulated by James Lovelock almost forty years ago, which states that the 
Earth is a living entity, like a single cell, and, like a single cell, everything it needs for its existence is 
contained within it. Professor Lovelock believes that the planet can heal itself if damaged, but, even 
with Gai a, there is a point of no return, beyond which the damage could be irreversible. We at Virgin 
knew what dangers came from wasting resources and carelessly burning fossil fuels but, for many 
reasons, even among the greenest of the greens, there was no real sense  of  urgency.  I’m  afraid  that  it  
wasn’t  until  it  began  to  affect  me  personally  that  I  sat  up  and  took  more  notice.  
I first got interested in looking for alternative fuels in the 1990s when I became more aware that 
oil  was  a  finite  resource.  Britain’s  o wn North Sea oil was running out and most of the rest of the 
world’s  supplies  were  in  the  hands  of  OPEC  in  a  very  unstable  Middle  East,  which  could  make  oil  
both vulnerable and expensive. The war between Iraq and Iran in the 1980s raised the price of oil f rom 
an average of $16 a barrel to a spike of almost $70. When Saddam went after the Kuwaiti oilfields in 
1990,  it  confirmed  oil’s  vulnerability  to  war.  As  someone  who  is  heavily  involved  in  the  transport  
business, I needed to be aware of the cost and avail ability of oil and I looked into the alternatives. 
Virgin used over 700 million gallons of jet fuel between the four airlines, and large amounts of diesel 
in Virgin Trains. In 1997, when we were investing in a new fleet of trains, I asked the manufacturer,  
Alstom, to ensure they were fuel efficient. As a result, our Pendolino trains are the only ones in 
Europe that put 20 per cent of electricity back into the grid every time the train brakes. And our 
Voyager diesel/electric trains are being converted to a b iofuel blend of rape and soya.  
Then, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the US drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and 
the huge refineries along the Gulf coast were damaged or destroyed, the price of refined fuels in the 
US went through the roof. W ith a major capacity shortage, I started to look into the potential of 
investing in our own oil refineries and, in fact, issued a press release to announce that we were 
building one hopefully to bring the price down.  
Ted Turner is an interesting blend of c apitalist, environmentalist and philanthropist, who is as 
well known for founding the CNN news channel as he is for owning the Atlanta Braves and for being 
an  Olympic  yachtsman  and  winning  the  America’s  Cup.  I  had  last  met  him  at  the  Time  Global  Health  
summit a few months earlier, alongside Bill Gates, Madeleine Albright, Paul Wolfowitz, Bono and 
others – and  after  I  announced  my  intention  to  build  an  oil  refinery,  Ted  rang  me  and  said,  ‘Richard,  
have  you  thought  of  the  alternatives?’  
‘What  do  you  suggest?’  I asked.  ‘Why  not  build  a  refinery  for  clean  rather  than  dirty  fuel?  Come  and  meet  my  people.  They  will  
convince  you  that  there  is  another  way.’  
Ted invited me to Washington to lunch with some members of the United Nations Foundation, a 
think -tank he had started up with a hefty donation of $1 billion to look into environmental issues and 
push  biofuels  in  the  US.  Around  the  lunch  table  with  Ted  were  Senator  Tim  Wirth,  the  UNF’s  
president;;  John  Podesta,  Bill   Clinton’s  former  chief -of-staff; Boyden Grey, Geor ge  Bush’s  legal  
counsel (shortly to be appointed US ambassador to the EU); and Reid Detchon, head of the Energy 
Future Coalition.  
The subject almost immediately turned to biofuels. I already knew a fair bit about fuels in 
general,  but  wasn’t  yet  as  knowled geable about biofuels as this group was. While they talked, I made 
my usual cryptic notes in the notebook I always carry, and, by the end of the meal, I decided that they 
were right. Instead of investing in conventional forms of refining, the more sensible  thing for Virgin to 
do would be to invest considerable sums in alternative fuels. I am lucky – once I make up my mind, I 
can  generally  do  something  about  it:  I  joined  the  steering  board  of  Ted’s  Energy  Future  Coalition;;  and  
went back to my team at Virgin and asked them to look into plant -based ethanol. The result was that I 
became hooked on the potential of biofuels as an environmental necessity and as one way forward to 
loosen  the  world’s  dependency  on  oilfields.  Both  environmentally  and  economically,  it   made perfect 
sense that individual countries should grow their own fuel and use it at point of origin, without 
transporting it halfway around the world – thus saving even more on financial costs and CO 2 
emissions.  
I formed Virgin Fuels in early 2006 and be gan an investment programme in research and 
development of biofuel. Our first investment was to back a California firm, Cilion, which makes 
bioethanol from corn. We started to build biofuel refineries in both the American West and Tennessee, 
at both the po int of origin and of use, and then moved into Brazil. The next stage will be to expand 
into the US East Coast and elsewhere in Europe.  
I  wasn’t  being  entirely  altruistic.  Alternative  fuels  should  be  a  good  business  move   – investing in 
them puts pressure on  fossil fuel prices and acts as a hedge for our airline and train companies. If the 
price of oil remains high, we can make very decent returns on both our research and development and 
our investment in the cost of building refineries. It also makes perfect  sense over the next five or six 
years to replace some or all of our conventional fuel with our own fuels.  
In  the  early  summer  of  2006,  Virgin  Fuels  had  already  made  its  first  investments  but  I  still  wasn’t  
fully aware of the urgency of global warming. But  nothing wakes one up more to the issues at hand 
than the former vice president of the United States coming all the way to your home in Holland Park, 
London, to give a personal lecture on global warming. When the film An Inconvenient Truth  came out 
some mo nths  later,  I  realised  that  he’d  test  run  it  on  me  at  my  home  that  day.  
We sat down at the low table in the sitting room and Joan brought in tea and sandwiches. Al 
perched on a corner of the table and pulled out his PC and switched it on. I sat in a big ar mchair, with 
Will Whitehorn leaning over behind me and Steve Howard of the Climate Group seated on the other 
side, and we all looked at the screen. It was quite an experience having a brilliant communicator like 
A1 Gore give me a personal PowerPoint presen tation. Not only was it one of the best presentations I 
have ever seen in my life, but it was profoundly disturbing to become aware that we are potentially facing the end of the world as we know it. The impact on humanity and the natural world could be so 
great that we have no choice but to do something drastic, first to stop it and then turn it around.  
During our intense discussion, Steve Howard said that we need to make people confident that this 
is a problem that can be solved. Some people think dealing with climate change could destroy the 
economy and is therefore an insoluble problem; but there is a lot we can do. We really have no choice 
in the matter: we have to do it.  
Al  agreed.  Looking  directly  at  me,  he  said,  ‘Richard,  you’re  known  the  world  over.   You could 
help to lead the way with me in dealing with climate change. Without the politicians we need business 
leaders  to  take  the  lead.’  
Al  Gore’s  lecture  was  a  polemic,  but  it  had  enough  good  science  around  it  to  work  really  well.  It  
was the first time I’d  been  presented  with  the  full  enormity  of  the  effects  of  climate  change.  I  saw  at  
once  that  if  we  don’t  do  something  fast  to  fix  carbon  emissions,  in  a  very  short  space  of  time  most  of  
the  Earth  will  be  uninhabitable  and  the  planet’s  population  will  plu mmet. Most animals and plants will 
become  extinct  and  life  will  be  wretched.  ‘I’m  just  about  to  launch  a  new  air  route  to  Dubai,’  I  said.  
Usually I like doing that kind of thing – but now I could see the paradox of it. We want a connected 
world, we want to  be able to fly, but we must also beat climate change.  
‘How  much  time  do  we  have?’  I  asked.  
Al  replied,  ‘Scientists  say  that  we  may  have  as  little  as  ten  years  before  we  cross  a  tipping  point,  
beyond which it will be too late. We have to make a massive and determined start. If we do, it is 
possible to start levelling out CO 2 within the next five years. Part of it is evolution. Our brains are 
good at perceiving danger in the form of fangs and claws and spiders and fire but we find it hard to 
deal  with  dangers  that  can’t  be  seen  until  it’s  too  late   – like the world heating up. Most of it is 
happenin g  right  now  at  the  poles,  where  very  few  people  see  it  and  so  couldn’t  care  less.’  
Al was very persuasive and remained good -humoured, despite his argument with Will as to when 
Lovelock  had  first  written  Gaia  Theory.  Sometimes  it’s  interesting  to  be  in  a  ro om with two people 
who  both  think  they’re  right!  
After Al Gore left, Will and I had a long discussion about the way in which Virgin could take a 
lead in dealing with global warming. Obviously, with over 50,000 people working for us and their 
livelihoods at  stake,  I  didn’t  want  to  make  any  drastic  changes  that  would  mean  we  would  run  
unprofitably; but I saw a way forwards in which we could act responsibly by making small changes – 
such as using long -lasting light bulbs and becoming paper free – as well as ma jor changes, like 
switching  to  biofuels  as  and  when  possible.  We  coined  the  phrase  ‘Gaia  Capitalism’  to  describe  this.  
The concept of Gaia Capitalism is all about solutions: we wanted to take an apparent contradiction and 
show that it worked and made real sense. We were able to do this efficiently because Virgin is like a 
massive ecosystem. The parts are separately run and managed, and even have their own shareholders, 
but  there’s  always  the  linkages  between  them.  
Three months later, Bill Clinton rang me to  see if I would make a pledge to his Global Initiative. 
That night in the bath I had an idea. Al Gore had said he needed leadership from me. What if I pledged 
100 per cent of all profits the Virgin Group made from our airline and train companies and invest ed them in developing alternative fuels? That could make a big difference and perhaps get other business 
leaders on board too.  
As a result of my conversation with Bill Clinton, two months later I flew to New York to attend 
the Clinton Global Initiative. On  21 September, the second day of the conference, I joined Bill Clinton 
and Al Gore to personally pledge $3 billion to develop clean fuels. As I was about to sign the 
commitment document, I looked up at President Bill Clinton and, with just the right degree  of 
dramatic  pause,  pen  poised,  said,  ‘That’s  an  awful  lot  of  noughts.’  
It was a firm commitment, intended not just to move the Virgin Group forwards, but to inspire 
others. The idea is to pinpoint our transport companies to fund this investment, but, if i t’s  not  met  
from that direction, the money will come out of our other existing businesses as well. We will do it, 
whatever  it  takes.  One  of  the  things  I  stressed  was  that  this  wasn’t  philanthropy  or  charity.  Our  entire  
Gaia project is based on sound commer cial  sense.  I  didn’t  want  the  media  to  give  the  impression  that  
this was some kind of donation to environmental causes – but they did, painting me as some kind of 
universal benefactor. Charitable donations do have their place, but to me it seems far more s ustainable 
to invest seed money in order to generate money for the future so that the ball continues to roll and we 
can have a better chance of competing with the oil and coal companies.  
After my public announcement, which, within moments, was beamed aroun d the world, Steve 
Howard  said,  ‘Richard,  we  work  with  lots  of  different  organisations,  but  the  pace  of  change  at  Virgin  
is  without  parallel.  It  is  really  impressive  to  see  the  Virgin  machine  unleash  itself.’  
Someone asked me what I felt about soaring oil prices.  To  the  disappointment  of  my  airline’s  
executives,  I  said,  ‘I  think  that  soaring  oil  prices  are  the  best  thing  that  has  happened  to  this  world.  It  
forces governments and big business to find new ways of reducing their dependency on oil. We 
needed so mething like this to happen to bring a halt to an almost suicidal dependency on fossil fuel. If 
we  could  get  it  right,  it  might  stop  Middle  East  wars  in  the  future.’  
I love the challenge of learning about industries I know nothing about. At school, I had n o 
interest in chemistry. Now I wanted to learn everything there was to know about ethanol, cellulosic 
ethanol, ISO butanol, methane and carbon; the best products to make fuels from – sugar, corn, switch 
grass, willow trees and waste product; about wind pow er and solar power; and about hydrogen and 
geothermals. By the end of a three -month crash course of asking questions, I felt I was equipped to 
start fulfilling my $3 billon pledge by ramping up Virgin Fuels as a global force. But the best way of 
learning w as to get on and do it: to try to turn Necker and Moskito into the first 100 per cent carbon 
neutral islands; to build our first corn and sugar ethanol plants; to try to develop clean ISO butanol for 
planes, and so on. I wanted to do for renewable energy w hat private capital did for mobile phones two 
decades ago, by turning a small idea into a universal phenomenon.  
Towards the end of 2006 I invited Tim Flannery to Necker to speak to all managing directors of 
Virgin worldwide on the environment. Tim is a bri lliant Australian scientist and explorer, whose 
groundbreaking book, The Weather Makers , had started me thinking about the climate in the first 
place.  I  think  what  Tim  will  do  for  us  is  to  help  give  us  the  scientific  background  to  the  path  we’ve  
now embark ed on, and give our people a much better understanding of why we are on it. It is not just 
about having green credentials; I have made a firm commitment that this is going to be an industrial 
strategy for Virgin in the twenty -first  century.  I’m  sure  that  I ’m  going  to  get  a  lot  of  criticism.  I  can  hear  people  saying,  ‘If  CO 2 emissions  are  the  problem,  why  doesn’t  Richard  Branson  just  stop  his  
planes  from  flying?’  But  people  want  to  fly  and,  if  we  stopped,  we’d  leave  a  gap  that  somebody  who  
might have no sens e of responsibility at all would fill. We want to be the people who fly, but in a 
responsible way. Towards this, by the end of the year, we were aiming to save fuel when planes took 
off. If they were towed to and from the end of the runway while waiting to  take  off,  they  wouldn’t  
need to stand around so long with their engines spewing out CO 2. We started the ball rolling by 
experimenting at Gatwick and Heathrow. If every airline did the same, we estimated that it would save 
up to three tonnes of aviation fu el per flight, and, together with other efforts, airlines could cut 
aviation carbon emissions by about 25 per cent worldwide.  
A  case  in  point  was  the  Virgin  Atlantic  Global  Flyer.  It  wasn’t  made  of  metal;;  instead  it  was  built  
of a carbon composite, which i s very light but capable of operating safely at very high altitudes to 
improve fuel efficiency dramatically. I had been there just a year earlier in Salina, Kansas and saw it 
off on its dazzling flight. I chased it to the freezing wastes of Canada and I wa s back in Kansas when it 
landed, sixty -seven hours later. I was excited when I saw for myself how it could circle like some 
glorious eagle, far above the world at 49,000 feet, and use less fuel per hour than a four -wheel -drive 
vehicle. This stunning achiev ement led us to starting up Virgin Galactic and investing in space, the 
final frontier. Without space, and the work of organisations such as NASA, we would not even know 
or understand the realities of climate change or feed the current population of the wo rld. Satellites 
beam back information from space that allows farmers to look at long -range weather forecasts and 
plan their planting and harvesting to the best advantage. Space also provides the answer to necessary 
future travel without atmospheric impact.  However, sadly, the technology is still in the dirty, polluting 
and carbon -intensive Cold War era and there has been no private investment in viable space -launch 
systems using renewable fuels. We aim to change that as well.  
Using the Virgin Atlantic Globa l  Flyer  as  a  model,  Virgin  Galactic’s  fleet  was  green  from  the  
word  go.  In  addition  to  the  spaceship’s  construction  from  carbon  composite  materials,  the  launch  
system prototype relies on a fuel derived from laughing gas and rubber, and, because of the uniq ue 
piggyback  launch  system,  we  can  do  thousands  of  flights  for  every  one  of  NASA’s.  
One of the big corporate events of recent years has been Virgin Galactic getting going. We had the 
concept of course, developed by Burt Rutan as a very benign space -launch system – but the first 
exciting thing was the realisation that this could be a new space -launch system to take payload and 
scientists into space. The second was that I could also clearly see a vision of the future and answer 
many  people’s  questions:  why  do es space really matter; and why have you got involved in it? Many 
people seemed to think that Virgin Galactic was some kind of challenge, a personal plaything, albeit 
an enormously expensive one. The truth is that space is the future of mankind. Everybody,  from Dr 
Tim  Hansen  at  NASA’s  Goddard  Institute,  who  is  one  of  the  fathers  of  space  science,  right  the  way  
through to Professor Stephen Hawking, the father of modern physics, agrees that better access to space 
and the utilisation of space is going to be cr ucial  to  the  reorientation  of  the  world’s  industries  in  
coping with climate change.  
For  a  start,  we  wouldn’t  even  know  about  climate  change  if  it  hadn’t  been  for  the  work  that  was  
done from space on proving that the climate is changing. Ground -based scienc e is unable to prove 
climate  change  in  the  way  that  satellites  have  done.  Secondly,  very  few  people  realise  that  we  couldn’t  
feed the current population of the world without observations about the climate and weather forecasts, 
which can only be done from space. The weather and agricultural satellites and the global positioning system in space give farmers a heads up on the weather patterns and allow an extra 15 per cent 
productivity  to  actually  reach  people’s  mouths.  Crate -loads  of  food  don’t  spoil  at  the   docks any more; 
farmers can choose to mill their corn a day earlier, farm it a day earlier, plant it a day later. The first 
thing many farmers in the American corn belt or the plains of India or the middle of China do every 
morning is to go on the Internet  and check out what the long -range agricultural satellites are saying 
they should be doing that day or that week. Access to space has allowed us to increase food 
production over the past fifteen years by about 10 per cent – which has just about coped with the 
population growth.  
One of the most crucial things we are going to have to face as a civilisation is population growth. 
It  is  the  key  to  our  survival  on  the  planet.  We  can’t  find  the  solution  scientifically  and  technologically  
unless  there’s  a  willpower  to  find  it.  The  real  p roblem  is  that  the  environmental  lobby  hasn’t  really  
grasped the fact there are 6.5 billion people on the planet.  
Tim Flannery sees the Earth as a spaceship circling through space. This is what he has to say on 
the  subject  of  Spaceship  Earth’s  population  i n The Weather Makers : 
  
In 1961 there was still room to manoeuvre. In that seemingly distant age there were just 3 billion 
people, and they were using only half of the total resources our global ecosystem could 
sustainably provide. A short twenty -five year s later, in 1986, we had reached a watershed, for 
that year our population topped 5 billion, and such was our collective thirst for resources that we 
were using all of  Earth’s  sustainable  production.  
In effect, 1986 marks the year that humans reached Earth ’s  carrying  capacity,  and  ever  since  
we have been running the environmental equivalent of a deficit budget, which is only sustained 
by plundering our capital base. The plundering takes the form of overexploiting fisheries, 
overgrazing pasture until it beco mes desert, destroying forests, and polluting our oceans and 
atmosphere, which in turn leads to the large number of environmental issues we face. In the end, 
though, the environment budget is the only one that really counts.  
By  2001  humanity’s  deficit  has   ballooned to 20 per cent, and our population to over 6 
billion. By 2050, when the population is expected to level out at around 9 billion, the burden of 
human existence will be such that we will be using – if they can still be found – nearly two 
planets’  w orth  of  resources.  But  for  all  the  difficulty  we’ll  experience  in  finding  those  resources,  
it’s  our  waste   – particularly the greenhouse gases – that is the limiting factor.  
Over  the  next  century  as  we  go  into  a  population  of  nine  billion  we’ve  got  to  be  mi ndful of space. 
During 2006, as I travelled to the crowded big cities of the world – to China, India, Africa, the US – I 
looked and saw and pondered. I am someone who believes in humanity and in the value of each single 
human  life.  I  can’t  bear  human  miser y and will do all I can to eradicate poverty, disease, suffering – 
yet a population of nine billion is simply unsustainable. The sheer weight of numbers and overuse of 
resources  will  end  up  killing  us.  I  didn’t  know  where  the  answer  lay,  or  what  the  way  fo rwards was. I 
knew that there was an urgency to stop climate change as fast as possible for us to just win some 
breathing space before we could even start to think of population numbers.  Our plans for Virgin Galactic were soaring ahead at a great speed. We  had broken ground on a 
space station of the future in New Mexico. It was like science fiction. Futuristic designer Phillipe 
Starck came up with a dramatic eye logo – a bright blue iris with black pupil – and this has been inlaid 
on top of a flat disc that  covers an enormous underground silo. The disc slides back silently in a very 
Star Trek  way, to reveal the launching pad below. But some things that should have flown smoothly 
ground to a depressing halt – thanks to archaic laws and human resentment.  
Back in 2004, when we first discussed launching Virgin USA in the US as a low -cost alternative 
airline to the existing domestic carriers flying long -haul between the East and West coasts, and 
ordered Airbus planes to show our intent, we expected some opposition  in the way of healthy 
competition.  What  we  didn’t  expect  was  to  be  sandbagged  by  an  old  xenophobic  law.  In  the  early  days  
of  flying,  America  was  worried  about  ‘foreign  planes’  flying  in  American  skies  and,  in  order  to  
prevent that, in 1926, they passed th e Air Commerce Act, which requires that all domestic airlines 
remained under the control of US citizens. This was boosted by the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 that 
says that no more than 25 per cent of the voting shares of any airline company based in the US shall 
be  in  foreign  hands.  This  meant  that  75  per  cent  had  to  be  under  the  ‘actual  control’  of  US  citizens,  
and we were told by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) that we had to restructure.  
We tried to comply, but I had no idea that endless prob lems would be put in our way. Two years 
dragged by with legal argument and eventually, in 2006, I asked Fred Reid, former president of Delta, 
to run the new carrier, which would be under the control of a US company, VAI Partners, which 
would own 75 per cen t of the capital stock and would appoint two -thirds of the voting members of the 
board of directors. We separated Virgin America from Virgin Atlantic and all our other airline 
companies, including Virgin Galactic, or any company that shared the Virgin bran d name. In addition 
to ordering new planes, we budgeted about $200 million for start -up marketing in the US, we moved 
our base of operations from New York to San Francisco, and I thought we were finally on track to fly.  
However, I had agreed to be the very  visible face of the airline. I was ready to get out there and 
promote it, as I have always done with all Virgin companies. Perhaps I was too visible. We received 
massive opposition from labour unions and all major airlines in America: Continental Airlines , 
American, United, the lot! Our DOT certificate was withheld for months thanks to this protectionist 
opposition, while we did everything feasible to comply with every new hurdle every step of the way. 
Even though Virgin America would be run by a board tha t was largely made up of US citizens, the 
opposition claimed that it was a ploy and I would still be in charge. As 2005 dragged on into 2006, we 
were  told  that,  ‘Virgin  America’s  responses  to  inquiry  were  not  sufficient  to  prove  that  the  airline  is  a  
“US  citizen”.’  Our  opponents  urged  the  DOT  to  require  us  to  produce  additional  documentation.  
Whatever  we  did,  however,  it  seemed  it  wasn’t  enough.  
Again, we proposed that the airline be restructured, with the voting shares held by a trust 
approved by the DOT a nd with only two Virgin Group directors on the eight -person board. In addition 
to  removing  the  Virgin  Group’s  veto  and  consent  rights,  Virgin  America  said  that  it  would  remove  me  
from the board, and possibly even drop the Virgin brand entirely. Then the ne w board said they would 
be  prepared  to  remove  CEO  Fred  Reid,  ‘should  the  DOT  find  that  necessary’.  
By that point, I had stepped back, although I was kept informed as a shareholder. I was very 
gratified that there was also a groundswell of populist support for Virgin America. California governor 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, and Hillary Clinton all said the new airline would create a thousand new jobs in its first year of service (estimates say this would rise 
to 50,000 new  jobs across the US by the fifth year). Even the San Francisco Giants came out in 
support. The biggest surprise, though, was the 50,000 letters sent in our support to Congress and DOT. 
As many as 25,000 Americans signed a petition in our favour and there w as a website, 
www.letVAfly.com , where people could check on news. There were T -shirts and mugs on sale with 
the slogan, LET VA FLY.  
I think people realised that Virgin America would keep prices down and improve the q uality of 
flying. In fact, a study by the Campbell -Hill group showed that if Virgin America had been allowed to 
fly in 2006, it would have saved US consumers more than $786 million, or an average of $88 per 
round trip for that year alone. It would also hav e led to discounting in most, if not all, new markets. 
This  was  the  opposition’s  problem.  As  Fred  said,  ‘In  the  old  school  of  airlines,  we’re  everybody’s  
nightmare. They want to kill a powerful new airline in its infancy. Maybe they need to pay attention t o 
what  their  customers  are  saying  about  their  level  of  service.’  
All our efforts seemed in vain; by the end of 2006, Virgin America was still grounded. Rumours 
were  circulating  that  we  would  only  be  allowed  in  the  air  if  the  US  got  ‘open  skies’  acce ss to 
Heathrow and other European airports, even though the two issues were totally unrelated.  
At the end of September 2006, I was in South Africa again, when Brad Pitt and I met with Nelson 
Mandela to help lend our support to a new landmines initiative wi th the appropriate name of the Sole 
of Africa – motto:  ‘It’s  time  to  put  your  foot  down’.  The  other  patrons  included  Mandela’s  wife  Graça  
Machel, Queen Noor of Jordan and John Paul DeJoria of John Paul Mitchell Systems. The Sole of 
Africa was working with the Mineseeker Foundation to get rid of the 100 million landmines that are 
buried in the earth and kill or maim someone every twenty minutes. A quarter of a million square 
miles of land in the world is useless – much of it in Africa, particularly in Mozamb ique. Graça was 
born into a farming family in that lush and beautiful country, so she was eager to be involved with the 
project. We would be starting in Mozambique to clear the land and return it to agriculture. As soon as 
the  land  was  cleared,  ‘Sole’  co -operatives would train local villagers to plant and harvest crops, which 
in turn would feed them and allow them to make a living by selling their surplus.  
The British Ministry of Defence had created wonderful new radar technology that used airships, 
built b y a Virgin company, the Lightship Group, to locate landmines. Before, only 40 square metres of 
land a day could be cleared, but the brilliant airship technology allowed 100 metres of land to be 
scanned per second. What would have taken 500 years would now take a decade or less. When 
Mozambique was returned to its farmers, then we would move on, country by country.  
Graça is also an advocate for children, and she and Mandela discussed with us the issue of the 
huge numbers of AIDS orphans in Africa. Again, the  figures were hard to comprehend. Brad was 
shocked  when  Mandela  turned  to  him  and  said,  ‘There  are  a  million  children  whose  parents  have  died  
from AIDS. More than 1,000 a day are orphaned in South Africa alone. Six, seven and eight year olds 
are now the so le  breadwinners  for  their  family.’  
The sheer quantity could seem overwhelming, but there is a story, which I find appealing. It goes 
like this: a young girl is walking along a beach where the sea has washed up hundreds of starfish 
which are dying on the sh ore. As she walks, she stoops and picks up the starfish and throws them back 
into  the  sea.  An  old  man  is  passing  and  says  to  her,  ‘Why  are  you  doing  this?  It’s  not  going  to  make  a  difference  because  there  are  hundreds  there.’  She  looks  back  at  him  and  says ,  ‘If  I  can  make  a  
difference  in  one  of  their  lives  then  it’s  worth  it.’  
This story is the parable that founded Starfish, a small organisation that opens and runs AIDS 
Community Day Care Centres in South Africa. Virgin Unite has been working at a grassroot s level 
and finding ways within the community to take care of these orphans. Africa is full of incredible, 
strong women, who seem to hold things together in a very Earth Mother kind of way. Nora is one. I 
can remember the first time I met her in a small vi llage some forty -five minutes outside Johannesburg. 
There, in a dirt clearing, was a small tin shack and, in it, Nora, an elderly woman, was cooking food 
for the 200 orphans who lived with her during the day. Somehow, she achieved enough to feed them 
all by going out and finding the food, then cooking it on a tiny little stove. We were just standing there 
looking and all I could see was this sea of two hundred heads, tiny people and their eyes – so huge in 
hungry faces. They have no one, and are petrified t o be picked up and hugged.  
Just  one  woman.  There’s  no  way  she  can  take  care  of  200  children,  yet  she  does.  It  was  scary.  
One way we can help is to invest in these women, who have seen the need and set up as surrogate 
mums  and  housemothers.  It’s  a  huge  issu e  and  no  one  has  really  contemplated  the  results  of  what’s  
going to happen to children who grow up without the individual love and attention needed by a child 
who is developing emotionally. I looked around at so many children, playing or tucking into a sim ple 
meal,  and  I  could  see  at  once  that  there  simply  wasn’t  enough  room  for  them  to  sleep  in  the  tiny  shack.  
I  asked,  ‘Where  do  all  these  children  sleep,  Nora?’  
She  laughed.  ‘Oh,  they’re  like  roosting  birds.  They  scatter  in  every  direction  at  night  and  find  
somewhere safe to sleep. In the morning, they come back like starlings to eat breakfast – and 
somehow  I  always  manage  to  find  something  for  them.’  
I felt humbled and emotional, but I also felt angry. If their mothers had been given antiretroviral 
drugs, t hey would have been there to bring up their children, instead of being used to line the pockets 
of the undertakers. Starfish was already helping Nora, but we gave them some money to help with 
expenses. Working with volunteers from Virgin Unite, we expanded  Nora’s   shack   and   built   an  
extension on the side to let children sleep there, and then we provided her with a very big stove and 
promised  her  a  constant  supply  of  cooking  fuel.  We  can’t  give  all  of  Nora’s  children  a  family  of  their  
own, but we can help Nor a and women like her.  
Sadly, the African continent is one of the few places in the world where the HIV prevalence rate 
continues to rise. By 2010, it is estimated that approximately three million children will be orphaned 
in South Africa alone. We support two Community Day Care Centres now. In October, we supported 
five more with the Loomba Trust. Cherie Blair came on that trip with us and launched them. If you 
think  of  the  UK  and  US,  we  have  so  many  resources.  It’s  very  frustrating  and  we  all  need  to  do  
everything we can to stop this ridiculous situation from continuing. I certainly have let this passion 
boil over a few times, including at the formal dinner given by the Loomba Trust. People should not be 
dying from preventable and treatable diseases – no ma tter where they live in the world.  
The death from AIDS of one of our waiters at Ulusaba some years ago brought this home to me. 
HIV/AIDS was treatable in the West and the death rate had dropped dramatically. This, as I had 
already seen, was far from the ca se in Africa. To have someone in our midst die in this way was a shock. Despite his sickness Donald Makhubele had remained positive, composing poetry, music and 
songs.  He’d  written  some  beautiful  words,  which  I  read  after  his  death,  feeling  choked  that  suc h a 
talented young man had been lost to us.  
The following writings were composed by our friend – Poet and Musician, Donald Makhubele. He 
passed on as a result of an AIDS -related illness. His music and his thoughts, along with these 
beautiful words, shall l ive on and enlighten others. He had hoped to reach people while he was alive 
and  well,  living  with  HIV,  but  the  Universe  deemed  he  would  speak  from  beyond…  
KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE  
A  SHORT  HISTORY  ABOUT  DONALD’S  SICKNESS!  
The day 14 S eptember 2003 was my second day of my employment at Ulusaba Private Game Reserve. 
It was summer, but in the middle of the night I started to feel cold. It felt like it was winter. I was 
bound  to  go  knock  on  David’s  room.  David  stayed  next  door,  so  I  asked   him for a heater because I 
could no longer stand the cold.  
The following morning David gave me some money to go to the doctor for a consultation. The 
doctor did not tell me what was killing me. He suspected Malaria; it was not Malaria. I came back to 
Ulusa ba  with  a  Doctor’s  Note.  I  was  not  able  to  work  until  the  days  that  were  given  to  me  to  be  off  
sick, came to an end.  
I returned back to work but since then my life was shacking. Every time I had to be absent from 
work  because  I  was  not  feeling  well.  I’ve  t ried Songomas, Private Doctors, but all that was unviewed 
or fruitless.  
Then it happened one day after I went on annual leave I started to realise that my stomach was so 
big and very painful. Then I went to the Private Doctor, Dr V Hlatswayo at Hazyview. H e helped me a 
lot, because he encouraged me to go to the Matikwane Hospital.  
‘ADMIT  &  HUMBLE  YOURSELVES  IN  ORDER  TO  GET  HELP’  
The doctor and I agreed that I would go to the hospital. When I arrived there I was bound to be 
admitted because I was in a bad co ndition. They took me to have an X -ray, but the end result of that 
was that they did not find anything. They also did a blood test and still nothing, until they drained 
some of the water from my stomach; my stomach was full of water. They sent some to the laboratory 
so I was just waiting for the results. The result was that I have TB PLEURA.  
After the results I started to take TB Tablets they gave me (Rifampin) and, I must be honest with 
you, these tablets helped me a lot. I did manage to gain my body weigh t again. I gained my appetite, 
but my condition started to get worse, after I stopped the Rifampin. I took five tablets daily and 
changed to two tablets but it started again. I felt dizzy, losing my energy and I was sweating a lot. 
When I went back for a c heck -up  I  told  them  how  I  was  feeling  but  they  just  didn’t  take  me  into  
consideration. They were just doing their own things. I took the TB treatments for almost nine months, 
until I went back for another check -up for the last time, and then I asked them t o do an HIV Test.  
‘MY  PEOPLE  ARE  DYING  BECAUSE  OF  THE  LACK  OF  KNOWLEDGE’  They conducted the test and, after the results, they told me that I am HIV Positive, but they cannot 
give me any treatment because they are still waiting for my CD4 Count Results; onl y then they can see 
what  to  do.  They  also  said  that  they  couldn’t  treat  me  if  my  CD4  cells  are  above  200;;  they  will  only  
give  me  treatment  if  it’s  below  200.  
MY POINT OF VIEW  
As far as I am concerned about this the Government are supporting HIV/AIDS to do their job of 
destroying the Nation. They told me that my CD4 count is above 200, which means that my system is 
still  strong  and  that’s  why  they  cannot  help  me.  So  I  thought,  t hat is totally wrong. Why wait until my 
CD4  cells  go  down,  before  they’ll  help  me?  Why  can’t  they  make  sure  that  the  virus  does  not  cross  the  
boundary to go from HIV to AIDS?  
‘BLESSED  ARE  THE  PEOPLE  WHO  ARE  EAGER  TO  HELP  BECAUSE  GOD  WILL  GIVE  
THEM  WISDOM’  
Because of everything that I have experienced during my sickness and until now, I know what is 
killing me, I feel like I can Rise and Shine. So that people can know the truth and the truth can set 
everyone free. It took me time to decide whether I should d o the test or not. Because I was scared that 
if  they  told  me  that  I’m  positive  I’d  start  to  worry  and  people  will  laugh  at  me.  But  I  must  tell  you  that  
now  I  know  my  status  I’ve  accepted  it.  I  forgave  myself  and  asked  God  for  forgiveness  and  I  have  put  
everything  behind  me  as  I’m  coming  from  X  to  next.  I’m  very  bold  and  strong  to  live  with  it  and  I’ll  
never die as a Coward, but as a Hero.  
By  the  way,  I’m  a  songwriter  who  writes  about  HIV  and  AIDS  so  I  had  to  know  my  status  so  that  
I can practise what I prea ch. I just want to be an example, especially in our area as it is a rural area and 
the people are still scared to expose themselves. The virus will spread all over if we hide it from 
others.  
Let us work together as one, to be proud of ourselves and have the same purpose in order to 
defeat our enemy. This is not a disease but it is a war that is in Africa, aiming to destroy our continent. 
I’m  pleading  to  everyone  who  can  read  this  message  to  co nsider it and come out with something to 
help the nation.  
* * *  
I’M  DONALD  THE  AFFECTED  ONE  
As  a  man  who  is  living  with  HIV,  I’m  always  thinking  about  positive  things  in  such  a  way  that  there  is  
nothing  painful  happening  to  me  anymore  and  I  don’t  have  a  ro om of disappointment in my heart as 
I’ve  had  worse  disappointments  in  my  life  before.  No  more  for  the  second  time.  
I’m  proud  of  myself,  I  love  myself,  and  I’ll  always  look  after  myself  for  better  health  and  I  live  
for  the  lives  and  future  of  others.  I’m  no w  fully  aware  that  I’m  responsible  for  my  family  and  myself  
and  hope  to  be  well  again.  I  really  didn’t  believe  that  you  can  live  with  HIV  and  AIDS  for  a  long  time,  
but I believe that I have lived life with it for a period that I did not know about my condi tion. Now that 
I know, I promise you that it will be cured and it will leave me like a free man. Like a man who has been  freed  from  jail  or  from  Chains.  I’m  telling  you  that  I’ll  rise  again.  God  said  that  he  would  give  
power to the weak so that they can fl y like an Eagle.  
If  this  can  work  for  me  again  I  know  that  it  can  work  for  you,  my  friend;;  don’t  even  be  scared  to  
go and do the test because it is helpful, especially if you are unsure of your life status. This is a good 
time to go ahead and be brave enou gh to fight the sickness, and, listen, united we will stand, but 
divided we fall so let us work together in order to become victorious at the end of the day.  
The  actual  cause  of  Donald’s  death  was  AIDS -induced TB; but malaria is also a major killer. After 
Donald  died,  I  swore  that  no  other  Virgin  employee  would  die  unnecessarily.  As  a  result  of  Donald’s  
moving words, and finding out more myself, I decided that it was wrong that any company anywhere 
in the world should lose any of its staff from AIDS, and th at every company in the world should 
pledge that they would encourage their staff to be voluntarily tested and make sure they get 
antiretrovirals in time to avoid HIV ever becoming AIDS. The first thing was to try to get our own 
house in order. So my wife Joan and I started the process by pulling in all the people who worked for 
us together in the bush. We then took an HIV test in front of everybody and we tried to get as many 
people as possible to take it. Most of them did; and we also asked young people w ho had HIV to come 
and explain how antiretroviral drugs had saved their lives, as an example to everyone of how the 
programme worked. We made two films, particularly for Africans, explaining, in simple and 
straightforward terms: how the body works; how ant iretroviral drugs work; how the immune system 
works; what happens when the CD4 level drops below 200; why people are dying; how they can avoid 
dying; and that condoms save lives. In a test in one of our businesses in South Africa, nearly 24 per 
cent were H IV  positive.  I’m  afraid  that  it’s  about  average,  which  basically  means  that  24  per  cent  of  
our staff would die within six to seven years if they did not have access to antiretrovirals. We made it 
clear that we would supply anybody who had a CD4 count that dropped below 300 with antiretroviral 
drugs free of charge. We also rolled out the 0% Challenge across all our businesses worldwide, 
focusing on ensuring that no Virgin staff members would ever die from AIDS, that 0% would become 
HIV positive, and that 0% of HIV positive pregnant mothers would pass on HIV to their baby. This 
also includes 0% tolerance of any discrimination against HIV positive people within our businesses.  
Donald  said,  ‘This  is  not  a  disease  but  it  is  a  war  that  is  in  Africa,  aiming  to  dest roy our 
continent. Let us work together as one, to be proud of ourselves and have some purpose in order to 
defeat  our  enemy.’  In  memory  of  Donald,  I’ve  decided  to  set  up  a  ‘War  Room’  to  help  co -ordinate and 
unite all the organisations in Africa who are try ing  to  defeat  African  diseases.  The  ‘War  Room’  will  
map out the problems, seek out best practices, and move and maximise resources. It will get on with 
the job rather than arguing and debating. It will alert the world to new diseases like AIDS before they 
get out of control. It will fight HIV, malaria, TB and fistula. It will mobilise experts, movers and 
shakers to get out to particular areas fast by pulling in contacts, governments and founders. Its ultimate 
aim is to make sure there are no more Donalds an d that, through his death, thousands of others live.  
After Donald died I happened to visit the local hospital with my mum and, by chance, came 
across a delightful man called Dyke, who used to be a game driver for Ulusaba. He was lying in a bed 
without hope , basically just a skeleton with no body fat left on him whatsoever. When he saw my 
mum, there was a glimpse of recognition and happiness in his eyes. We instantly put him on 
antiretroviral drugs. His improvement was immediate. He completely recovered. Tha nks to getting 
proper  medicine  and  treatments,  he  went  from  literally  death’s  door  to  leading  a  normal  life  again.  
Everyone who has AIDS should have this opportunity of being reborn. Very sadly, Dyke has recently died from a bout of malaria that he contrac ted on a trip to Mozambique – which has made me even 
more determined not to let a small insect continue to wipe out thousands of people in Africa every 
single day.  
I did some research with Virgin Unite and a wonderful man from Anglo American called Dr 
Brian Brink into finding a blueprint of hope and, amongst treeless, rocky hills and the dismal poverty 
of the dusty rural townships of Elandsdoorn in Limpopo Province, we came across the Ndlovu 
Medical Centre. It is run by Dr Hugo Templeman, an earnest Dutch p hysician, who has dedicated the 
past fifteen years to treating HIV/AIDS, as well as the other big diseases that kill Africans: TB and 
malaria.  
One of the first things I noticed when I was shown around was the cluster of small development 
projects outside N dlovu hospital, including a bakery, a repair shop, nappy manufacturing, pre -schools, 
computer school, car washes, a gym, all offering employment to locals. Hugo saw I was impressed.  
‘Yes,  we’re  all  about  hope   – and we want people to know that they will get  well. They also need 
to  make  a  living  to  keep  themselves  and  their  families  while  they  are  being  treated.’  
Dr Brink had fought a stubborn battle over many years to get antiretroviral drugs prescribed free 
of  charge  to  any  of  Anglo’s  tens  of  thousands  of  w orkers who needed them. He finally won by 
pointing out that the loss in trained staff cost more economically than the costs of the drugs 
themselves.  Once  he  won  that  battle  he  then  said,  ‘Now,  what  about  the  miners’  families,  who  have  
HIV  and  AIDS?’  
I admi red his forthright attitude and, with Hugo and Virgin Unite, we discussed what it would 
take to build a hospital to serve the Sabi -Sands district around Ulusaba. My first venture in helping to 
control the spread of HIV was in the early 1990s when I launche d a charity, Mates condoms. It was a 
big step from free Mates condoms to joining with Anglo American to create a one -stop healthcare 
centre. We decided that the new hospital would be named the Bhubezi Community Health Centre after 
the Zulu word for lion. I t would serve 100,000 people. Treatment for HIV, TB and malaria would be 
free, but other medical services would have a modest charge that will help ensure that the clinic 
becomes sustainable over time. The 100,000 people around Ulusaba would be protected. However, for 
those who live far from the hospital, the treatment needs to get to them.  
It  is  difficult  to  reach  that  ‘last  mile’  in  remote  areas  with  health  services.  So  we  kicked  off  a  
campaign  called  Heaven’s  Angels  across  the  whole  Virgin  Group  to  raise  money to buy and maintain 
motorbikes. The businesses, especially Virgin Trains and Virgin Atlantic, have done a wonderful job 
raising over $1m (US) to put over 100 bikes on the road. The working model we are building is that 
someone from a village buys th e bike through a loan; in return, they are trained and paid to deliver 
healthcare on the motorbike three days a week, and the rest of the week they can use the bike for their 
own entrepreneurial activity. In this way, it becomes sustainable and creates job s for people within the 
communities. In 2007 we began to test this model with a great partner called SHEF, who have already 
built over sixty -four sustainable clinics and pharmacies across Kenya – all owned by local people. 
We’d  like  to  scale  that  up  to  hel p with healthcare delivery across Africa, with not hundreds, but 
thousands of biking medical outreach workers, and by showing the people themselves how they can 
earn a living, help each other and go that last mile.  On the one hand, I was working hard throu gh Virgin Unite to try to help the developing world with 
some of the problems they face; and on the other hand, I was working hard at taking our space -launch 
programme forward. It was a strange but fascinating dichotomy. Virgin Galactic had caused a great 
stir and people had already signed up for our first flights. Then something remarkable happened in my 
personal journey to space.  
I was on Necker in November with Burt Rutan, the designer of the spaceship, and a group of our 
founding customers, who had come  out  to  find  details  of  the  project  directly  from  Burt’s  own  mouth.  
Will called from London to say he had just listened to Professor Stephen Hawking on the Today  
programme on Radio Four.  
Will  said,  ‘Stephen  Hawking  has  just  done  an  amazing  interview,  about  why man needs to be in 
space – and  why  he  still  wants  to  go  and  why  if  possible  he’d  like  Richard  Branson  to  take  him  there!’  
I gathered all of our founding customers and Burt around a set of speakers and we linked up to 
the Internet and played Stephen Ha wking’s  podcast  from  the  BBC  site  to  them:  ‘The  human  race  must  
move to a planet beyond our solar system to protect the future of the species. Life could be wiped out 
by a nuclear disaster or an asteroid hitting the planet. Once we spread out into space an d establish 
colonies, our future should be safe. There are no similar planets to Earth in our solar system so 
humans will have to go to another star. Current chemical and nuclear rockets are not adequate for 
taking colonists into space, as they would mean a journey of 50,000 years. I discount using warp drive 
to travel at the speed of light for taking people to a new outpost.  
‘Instead,  I  favour  matter/anti -matter annihilation as a means of propulsion. When matter and anti -
matter meet up, they disappear in a  burst of radiation. If this was beamed out of the back of a 
spaceship, it could drive it forward. Travelling at just below the speed of light, it would mean a 
journey of about six years to reach a new star. It would take a lot of energy to accelerate to n ear the 
speed of light.  
‘My  next  goal  is  to  go  into  space;;  maybe  Richard  Branson  will  help  me.’  
There was a ripple of excitement amongst our budding astronauts. We all felt privileged to be 
part of a project he felt so enthusiastic about. I never cease to be amazed by Professor Hawking – a 
man I admire greatly. I have met him a couple of times over the years, so I picked up the phone and 
called him. I explained that we had not given away any free tickets on Virgin Galactic to anyone, 
despite the large numbe r of celebrities approaching us, but if Stephen really felt up to it and was 
medically shown to be fit to fly, it would be a privilege to carry him into space.  
Using his computerised voice he explained that mankind simply had to get into space if we were 
going  to  maintain  life  on  Earth.  ‘There  is  a  threat  to  life  on  Earth  posed  by  humans.  The  two  main  
causes of concern are global warming and the genetic alteration of vaccines and other 
microorganisms. Because we now have enough knowledge of the things that could happen to this 
planet  to  know  that  we  need  to  use  the  resources  of  the  rest  of  the  solar  system  if  we’re  going  to  
survive  as  a  civilisation.  And  we  need  also  to  have  the  incentive  to  go  out  and  explore;;  and  it  can’t  
only be about robots going into sp ace although that is part of the answer. People have to be able to go 
there.’  He  added,  ‘Virgin  Galactic  is  a  step  towards  taking  access  to  space  out  of  the  hands  of  the  
chosen  few.’  At my request, Stephen Attenborough, head of astronaut relations, went to  see Dr Hawking with 
our Chief Medical Officer to discuss the logistics of arranging a simulation gravity flight for him as 
soon as possible.  
Continuing  on  from  Dr  Hawking’s  interest  in  our  project,  we  looked  into  many  other  aspects  of  
why space matters. T here is the short -term reason of understanding climate change and providing us 
with the communications and information to keep the planet producing food it needs for its 
burgeoning population. But, as he said, in the long term we also need to be in space t o provide the 
future sources of energy for the planet and possibly even some of the solutions to climate change. For 
example, many exciting ideas are being developed, such as solar umbrellas. They are not as big as 
people might think, but small crystalline  structures made of transparent film that are scattered in space 
like bubbles at the Lagrange Point, which is halfway between the sun and the Earth. Here, the 
umbrellas  would  reflect  back  about  5  per  cent  of  the  sun’s  rays,  which  in  real  terms  is  a  lot.  Pe ople 
also think that the Internet is somehow energy free; but it emits masses of greenhouse gas. Scientists 
have been looking into Serva farms, for example, which are fuelled by solar panels and beam back 
radio signals from space direct to computers, savin g a massive 80 per cent in electricity. One of the 
things I am also very interested in is the possibility of taking a Virgin Fuels research team to the moon 
– then building a fleet of spaceships so we can work there. This might sound like science fiction, but 
at the start of the decade I had no idea that I would be running a spaceship fleet and would be taking a 
suborbital flight into space with the most brilliant physicist alive today. In keeping with Stephen 
Hawking’s  opinion  that  our  future  could  lie  in   space, I have been looking at a space -age fuel: Helium -
3.  It  is  an  incredibly  rare  form  of  helium  on  the  surface  of  the  Earth,  and  freely  available  at  the  Earth’s  
core, far beyond our present capabilities to tap. But there is a rich abundance of it in moon  dust. When 
I considered that just a single spaceship load from the moon would power the US for a year, it did 
make me pause and do more research into the possibilities. Helium -3 is made under extreme pressure 
and extreme heat. It was made when the moon ri pped out of the Earth and flew into orbit around it, 
and continues to be made by solar winds down countless millions of years. Scientists can make only 
minuscule amounts, at a cost of billions of dollars, in the accelerator at Cern. Getting it from the moo n 
– where  it  would  be  ‘mined’  from  the  dust  and  then  heated  to  release  the  gas  itself   – would not be 
wildly expensive, nor beyond our ability. Helium -3  could  supply  all  of  the  Earth’s  energy  needs  way  
into the future by using fusion, which is both clean an d safe. It would allow the land being earmarked 
to grow biofuels to be given over to growing food. As far -fetched as it might sound, Helium -3 could 
one day save humanity.  
In February 2003, when it had looked inevitable that the US and UK were going to inva de Iraq, I 
decided that I could not just stand by and watch. I had to do something to try to stop it. Sadly, before I 
could, America began bombing Iraq. But it got me thinking: maybe we should gather together a group 
of global Elders, in the hope that thei r voices and wisdom and negotiating power could avoid such 
conflicts in the future.  
At the same time, at his home near Bath, my good friend Peter Gabriel had a wonderful vision 
that technology was propelling people into one large global village – yet there  was no one there to lead 
this  village  and  use  technology  as  a  powerful  force  for  good.  Many  of  today’s  leaders  are  not  there  to  
do the right thing for humanity, but instead most of them have some other type of agenda linked to 
political, military, economi c or religious power. Our ideas converged on a poignant trip to South 
Africa in November 2003 when we were helping Mandela launch his 46664 campaign. Since then we 
have been on a deeply satisfying journey with the help of some amazing individuals to build a dream of pulling together a group of Global Elders. We believe that men and women who have shown moral 
integrity and leadership have a great deal of wisdom to offer. It is the kind of wisdom that has always 
been historically passed down by tribal or vill age elders. Ancient, intuitive wisdom is what our frantic, 
high-tech, global village needs. When Mandela and his wife Graça Machel agreed to be the Founding 
Elders and Archbishop Tutu agreed to chair the group, we knew that we had the core of something 
very special.  
In July 2006 on Necker, we held a gathering of some of the top leaders in the fields of 
technology, philanthropy, business, science, the arts and many other areas, all of whom had come 
together to debate the Elders concept and to take it forward to the nex t stage.  
Peter and I opened the first day by explaining where the idea for the Elders had originated. Peter 
said,  ‘I  see  it  based  on  African  tribes,  who  look  up  to  the  elders  in  their  village.  But  now  we’re  way  
beyond  the  little  village.  Now  there’s  Google  and  Wikipedia  and  all  the  other  links  to  connect  people.’  
I  nodded.  ‘There  have  been  individual  Elders  operating  alone  for  a  long  time.  Good  men  and  
women who speak out. The idea is if the most respected people in the world work together as a group, 
they will  be  more  effective.  Instead  of  the  power  of  one,  we’ll  have  the  power  of  twelve.’  
It was two weeks filled with incredible ideas and debates, but most of all the overwhelming 
confirmation that the world needs a group like this. It was the most fantastic  experience to be in the 
presence of some wonderful individuals like Archbishop Tutu and President Carter. Both of them 
added such deep insights into the Elders concept, and Tutu of course added a playful sense of humour. 
I will never forget some of the ma gical  moments,  like  Peter  playing  ‘Biko’  on  the  grand  piano  in  the  
living room of the Great House with Tutu and his beautiful wife Leah dancing. Or when Peter, in a 
long, white flowing shirt, was teaching Tutu how to swim in the ocean. He seemed to enjoy i t because 
he spent some time with Peter and me practising in the pool.  
‘I’ve  got  a  pool  at  home  I  don’t  use.  My  wife  and  children  do,  so  perhaps  now  I  can  join  them,’  
he said, smiling broadly.  
We also had the pleasure of having some amazing grassroots Elde rs join us to give their views on 
how the Global Elders could make a difference. Zachie Achmat from the Treatment Action Group 
inspired us all with his passion to ensure that everyone who is HIV positive has access to antiretroviral 
drugs. He has truly giv en up his whole life to fight for the lives of others, refusing to take treatment 
himself until everyone can get the drugs. Hopefully the Global Elders can play a role in amplifying the 
voices of people like Zachie and Taddy Bletcher – individuals doing im pactful work who need their 
stories heard around the world to help them scale up their efforts. Everyone spoke freely and frankly, 
putting forward strong and sensible opinions and points of view.  
Jean Oelwang led off one session by commenting about Mandela .  ‘This  is  an  amazing  time  in  
history.  Mandela  has  true  moral  courage.  He’ll  say  the  same  thing  behind  closed  doors  and  out  in  
public.  He’s  focused  on  what’s  best  for  humanity,  and  he’s  demonstrated  leadership,  not  just  through  a  
course of action but throu gh  compassion.’  
She  handed  over  to  Archbishop  Tutu.  He  got  up  with  difficulty  from  a  low  seat  and  joked,  ‘That  
happens  when  you  are  at  this  age.  You  have  to  have  a  discussion  with  your  body  and  say,  Body,  we’re  
about  to  get  up  now,  how  about  it?’  I gave hi m a shoulder rub – but  joking  aside,  all  of  the  things  Tutu  said  were  moving.  ‘I’m  glad  
I’m  not  God.  God  must  be  weeping;;  God  is  omnipotent  but  seems  weak.  We  wonder  why  he  doesn’t  
zap people who do wrong. But there are people who rise up and do good thing s – they overthrow 
apartheid.  Sometimes,  like  sun  shining  through  the  rain,  God  looks  and  smiles.  He’s  smiling  today  on  
this island. I firmly believe this is a moral universe. Despite all appearances to the contrary where it 
often seems so clear that evil is on the rampage. But in the ultimate end, good prevails. Compassion, 
caring,  are  what  will  ultimately  have  the  last  word.’  
One important issue we discussed was what difference the Elders could make, without replicating 
the role of the United Nations, or the important work of the World Health Organisation (WHO). I 
started  the  ball  rolling  by  saying,  ‘We  have  all  discussed  the  idea  that  the  Elders  would  cover  areas  
that  the  UN  and  nation  states  are  not  covering.’  
Obviously, Jimmy Carter had personal experie nce not only of working through the UN, but also 
working through his own foundation, the Carter Center. He said that one of the problems that beset the 
UN was the veto, and that there was a lot of horse trading behind the scenes to get some resolutions 
through.  ‘You  can’t  get  past  the  veto  in  the  UN.  It  would  be  feasible  for  the  Elders  to  bypass  this.  
There  isn’t  anywhere  now  people  can  go  for  conflict  resolution.  To  further  the  peace  process.  To  
provide experts on how do you negotiate peace. There are orga nisations – Harvard, the Carter Center – 
but  you  can’t  go  to  the  UN  because  you  know  the  US  will  veto  one  side,  Russia,  China,  the  other.  So  
the  Elders  as  a  peace  foundation  or  whatever,  so  that  people  will  say  as  a  first  response,  Why  don’t  I  
go to the El ders  to  help  prevent  this  war?  If  we  had  a  perfect  UN  we  wouldn’t  need  it.  But  the  UN  
isn’t  dealing  with  peace  or  the  alleviation  of  suffering,  or  human  rights  violations,  the  oppression  of  
women.  You  can’t  get  them  to  debate  the  oppression  of  women  becaus e many Muslim countries are 
against that. Christians too. This is the kind of thing Elders could address without constraint and the 
hell  with  the  fact  that  it  isn’t  being  done.  I  bet  that  Kofi  Annan  would  be  saying  Amen  on  all  this.  The  
Carter Center worke d  to  set  up  a  High  Commission  on  Human  Rights  which  the  UN  didn’t  want.  We  
are talking about an organisation that could supercede the UN and avoid the inherent constraints of a 
two-hundred -member  organisation.’  
It was heavy stuff. We had a consensus during  that session that the Elders should seek to 
reinforce  women’s  rights,  and  to  do  it  from  a  position  of  being  above  politics.  
‘But  with  no  authority,’  Jimmy  said.  ‘That’s  important.  Only  moral  authority.’  
Where the work of the World Health Organisation was concerned, it was thought that the Elders 
would need a broad agenda to look at controversial issues, such as HIV/AIDS, helping to ensure clean 
drinking water for all – 80 per cent of the developing world does not have access to clean drinking 
water – and disease. While the Elders would support eradicating malaria, for example, only WHO 
would  have  the  authority  to  use  the  term  ‘eradicate’.  
Jimmy  said,  ‘The  Elders  could  try  to  promote  the  quality  of  life  in   the poverty -stricken world. If 
they  don’t  want  to  create  something,  they  can  help  with  the  structure  of  something.  Alleviating  
suffering  through  disease  eradication  is  part  of  that.’  
Every day was like that – filled with solid debate and discussion, each t ime moving the concept 
and our dreams forward a little. We all understood exactly where he was coming from when Peter said,  ‘The  world  is  a  living  mirror.  Astronauts  say  from  space  you  see  the  Earth  as  something  you  can  
hold in your hand, a little blue bal l. Light bounces off it; everything is reflected. My four -year-old son 
was  telling  me  a  story.  He  said,  when  people  get  touched,  they  light  up.  When  they  don’t,  they  go  into  
the  shadows;;  so  we  should  try  to  get  everyone  touched.  They’re  not  numbers  and  sta tistics, but real 
people.’ 
Ideas  seem  to  stimulate  ideas.  It  was  as  if  we’d  had  these  hopes  buried  inside,  just  waiting  to  
burst out. Even just before Jimmy Carter left, he turned back with some last -minute  thoughts.  ‘Elders  
can be the conscience of the wo rld. They can be a guide to the world, an entity that is recognised for 
putting forth ideals of peace and justice. Being here has been delightful. It has been an inspirational, 
exciting,  unpredictable  and  gratifying  experience.’  Then  with  a  wave  and  his  ch aracteristic broad 
smile, he went up the steps and the helicopter lifted him and his wife Rose up and away.  
Back  at  the  house  I  asked  Tutu  if  he  would  like  some  tea.  ‘No,  I’m  not  English,’  he  replied  with  a  
twinkle.  
‘Oh,  you’d  like  Peter’s  tea.  He  has  more  time  to  make  tea  than  I  do,’  I  joked.  
A month later we met with Graça and Mandela at their home for them to make the selection for 
the initial group of Elders. Grandchildren scurried around us, and Jean and I walked out of this 
wonderful meeting, feeling that the Elders was finally a reality. We went on to Ulusaba and had a 
wonderful celebration signing the invitation letters. It was even more emotional as my father and 
mother were there to share this special moment with us. The dream that Peter and I had so many years 
ago was gathering momentum.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 32 Flying high  
2007  
IN MOST OF THE  Western Hemisphere that February morning of 2007, it was bitterly cold, with 
reports of snow, high winds and ice storms. Meanwhile, my mum was enjoying her morning swim in 
the cry stal-clear waters inside the reef at Necker – being in her eighties has never stopped her from 
doing anything – and  I  was  gazing  northwest  towards  an  island  that  I  couldn’t  see,  but  had  just  bought  
for £10 million, which was a far cry from the modest £180, 000 Necker had cost in 1976. Having a 
fresh challenge gave me a buzz and my head was filled with plans.  
Now,  you  might  think  that  one  paradise  island  would  be  enough  for  anyone,  and  you’d  be  right.  
However, I had bought this second pristine jewel of an isl and to prevent it from being ruined by 
overdevelopment. Moskito is named after the original Moskito Indians who had lived there back when 
Sir Walter Raleigh arrived and named the Virgin Islands after Queen Elizabeth I. It has one slightly 
scruffy dock and a few small buildings that looked as if they might blow over in a light breeze – but, 
other  than  that,  the  island  hasn’t  been  touched  almost  since  time  began.  It  is  a  beautiful  place  and  I  
wanted to do the minimum possible to make it comfortably habitable.  An island is a perfect 
microcosm of the world – and this could be a Utopian model for dealing with global warming. 
Towards this end, I asked Dan Kammen, a professor at Berkeley, and Ken Kao from Harvard 
University to do a study to come up with suggestions  that would turn Moskito into the greenest island 
in the Caribbean.  
I bought Necker more than thirty years ago, when I was just twenty -eight years old. I wanted a 
desert island hideaway where my friends could roam around with bare feet. Consequently, Necke r has 
remained an unspoiled Eden, a family home where our friends could come and share with us in peace 
and privacy. I had already asked the people on Necker to use environmentally friendly materials, such 
as long -lasting light bulbs and organic cleaning p roducts. We have planted an organic vegetable 
garden,  are  using  biofuels  in  the  generator  and  have  wind  and  solar  power.  One  bonus  is  that  we’ve  
proven these natural methods are cheaper than conventional fuel. But Moskito was a clean slate, 
where I could d o a lot more.  
When I walked over Moskito for the first time as its new owner, I was filled with excitement. I 
don’t  think  you  ever  get  over  that  desert -island feeling. There are many beautiful birds and masses of 
flowering trees, a small Caribbean rainfore st, hills that are higher than on Necker with magnificent 
views, and some dramatic cliffs. I found a large salt -water lake that had silted up and one of the first 
things we did was to fill it with water to encourage birds and fish. I decided there and then  that all the 
materials we used would be green and renewable. Vents open to the windy side of the island would 
provide free air conditioning.  
Living inside an ecological experiment will be a challenge. If you go around the world saying 
that, in order for t he world to survive you have to make huge changes in your way of life, it does help 
if you yourself walk the walk and talk the talk. Moskito will be a role model for the chief minister of 
the British Virgin Islands; and, after, it could be a model for the Caribbean as a whole – perhaps even 
for the world. Someone suggested that I should change its name though!  Sometimes, I feel bad about the number of times Joan packs and unpacks suitcases as we travel around 
the  world,  and  I  wondered  once,  ‘Don’t  you  get  tired  of  always  having  to  pack?’  
‘Oh,  it’s  all  right,’  she  said  matter -of-factly,  folding  another  sweater,  ‘ I know how to do it 
properly.  When  I  was  younger  I  used  to  work  in  a  pawnbroker’s  shop  in  Glasgow.  I’d  unpack  
everything when people brought it in to pawn it on a Monday, and repack it when they came in on 
Friday  to  redeem  it.’  
I laughed. What a different life  she’d  had  since  being  brought  up  in  a  caretaker’s  flat  and  working  
for a pawnbroker in Glasgow. But the matter -of-fact  way  she’d  compare  our  travels  to  working  in  a  
pawnbroker’s  and  her  straightforward  approach  to  life  is  one  of  the  things  I  love  abou t her. Shortly 
after I had signed the Climate Initiative with Bill Clinton, I was sitting on the end of the bed watching 
a discussion on the TV news about the urgency of global warming. Joan was behind me, packing yet 
another suitcase that lay open on the bed. 
‘James  Lovelock  believes  we  may  have  already  gone  past  the  tipping  point  and  that  the  amount  
of CO 2 in  the  air  means  mankind  is  doomed,’  I  said  to  her.  
‘Man  created  the  problem.  Man  should  solve  the  problem.  There  must  be  somebody  out  there  
who can so rt  it  out.  There  are  a  lot  of  good  brains  out  there,’  Joan  said,  as  if  it  were  blindingly  
obvious. I turned around and stared at her. She was right. If you look at the history of scientific and 
industrial development going right back to the seventeenth cen tury, most of the big innovations of the 
past  400  years  have  come  about  as  a  result  of  offering  big  prizes.  I  had  enjoyed  reading  Dava  Sobel’s  
book Longitude , which is about the first -ever industrial prize of the modern era. The British 
government offered £20,000 at the start of the eighteenth century to whomever could develop a 
portable clock so accurate that sailors at sea could tell where they were on a line of longitude 
anywhere in the world. Navigators had always relied on the position of the sun and s tars for plotting 
their course on charts, but, when it was overcast and cloudy, they often went miles off course, got lost 
or  were  shipwrecked.  Maps  were  inaccurate,  and  arriving  at  one’s  destination  was  more  miss  than  hit.  
A foolproof method of accurate n avigation would be of great value to the English whose colonies 
stretched over half the world. The man who eventually won was a clockmaker, John Harrison – but 
without such a huge prize he probably would not have bothered to spend half his life solving the  
puzzle. Prizes became the main way in which almost all modern industrial development has taken 
place. The first cars – and, ironically, also aeroplanes – were spurred in their development by prizes.  
Sometimes prizes were offered by governments – as was th e case with the longitude prize – or by 
individuals, as in the Blue Riband that I had helped win some years previously. But prizes were the 
spur to science of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. And, of course, it was even a prize that 
inspired the de sign of the Spitfire in the early 1930s. After World War II governments took over and 
they paid scientists to come up with solutions; big prizes offered by individuals slowed to a trickle.  
Virgin itself has been a beneficiary of the X prize, that was set u p to stimulate affordable private 
space travel. Burt Rutan and Paul Allen had successfully won the $10 million prize by developing a 
prototype spaceship called SpaceShipOne. It was that very prize that led directly to us investing in 
developing SpaceShipTw o with Burt – and, ultimately, to Virgin Galactic.  If we had gone beyond the tipping point because of the amount of carbon and methane already in 
the  Earth’s  atmosphere,  perhaps  we  could  challenge  scientists  and  brilliant  minds  to  come  up  with  a  
way to ext ract it.  
I  picked  up  the  phone  and  called  a  group  of  people  to  sound  them  out  and  to  make  sure  I  wasn’t  
mad. I spoke to Will, who has a good grasp of science and is running Virgin Galactic for us; to Josh 
Bayliss, our in -house lawyer; and, finally, I spoke  to Shai Weiss, CEO of Virgin Fuels, to ask their 
opinions. All of them sounded cautious notes of optimism. They agreed that it certainly sounded 
possible, but that I should probably ask a scientist. So I asked James Lovelock, Steve Howard of the 
Climate G roup and Tim Flannery. They told me that some work was already being done with 
capturing CO 2 gas in various parts of the world and the stimulus of a major prize would be very good. 
So  Joan’s  almost  casual  comment  quickly  took  the  shape  of  a  $25  million  pri ze to find a way to 
actually remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is not to be confused with stopping CO 2 
getting into the atmosphere in the first place. Our prize is for taking CO 2 that is already there out of 
the atmosphere, and this will incl ude methane and greenhouse gases generally.  
We are not looking for an agricultural solution to the problem because those methods are already 
known among scientists and have their constraints. By agricultural solution, I also mean using the sea, 
such as alg ae  seeding  in  the  ocean,  although  it’s  a  very  interesting  area.  There  have  been  some  
experiments in the South Pacific –South Atlantic areas, off New Zealand and Brazil: algae captures 
CO 2 and, when depleted, the algae sinks to the bottom, theoretically out of  harm’s  way.  The  problem  
is  that  there  is  always  the  law  of  unintended  consequences  and  it’s  not  known  what  possible  effect  
large areas of algae could have on the fish population.  
People  are  already  planting  more  trees,  and  we’re  going  to  continue  that  p rocess. We have also 
suggested  using  ‘set -aside  land’  in  Europe  to  grow  trees.  We  are  talking  about  maintaining  the  
biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest, the African rainforests and the Asian ones – although, even as I 
write, in the next twenty -four hours , deforestation will cause as much CO 2 as eight million people 
flying from London to New York. One of the old ideas on climate change was to seed silver iodide to 
make  clouds  rain,  and  that’s  not  what  we  are  looking  for  either  because  it’s  not  new.  What  we  are 
looking at is a way to find a process using the forces of nature or something else to literally take CO 2 
out of the atmosphere – something absolutely innovative that has not been thought of. And let me 
assure you now that no reader will win this prize  by sending me an acorn in the post tomorrow 
morning!  
Our proposed Climate Prize seemed to tie up extraordinarily well with a range of projects we 
were working on linking back to Gaia Capitalism, the Clinton Initiative and Virgin Fuels, then linking 
forwar ds from the Climate Prize towards Virgin Galactic. Once I had all the information and was 
assured that it made sense and had arranged a trust fund to be put in place for the prize itself, I 
telephoned Al Gore and asked him if he would launch the prize with  me. 
‘I’d  be  glad  to,  Richard,’  he  said  without  hesitation.  
A mere six weeks after my conversation with Joan, on 9 February 2007, A1 Gore and I held a 
press   conference   in   my   London   garden   to   announce   the   $25   million   prize,   the   ‘Virgin   Earth  
Challenge’,  to   inspire innovations in the field of combating climate change. A1 said to the media gathered  there,  ‘What  we  are  facing  is  a  planetary  emergency.  So  some  things  you  would  never  
consider  otherwise,  it  makes  sense  to  consider.’  
As we were filmed tossing into the air a beach ball that was painted to look like the Earth, as seen 
from  space,  I  said,  ‘The  prize  will  go  to  whoever  comes  up  with  the  most  innovative  way  of  sucking  
harmful greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere within three years. The Earth cannot wai t sixty years. 
We  need  everybody  capable  of  discovering  an  answer  to  put  their  minds  to  it  today.’  It  also  occurred  
to me that, while finding a solution to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might be as hard as finding a 
cure for cancer, if something does co me of it, we could all enjoy life and not feel guilty about leaving 
the light on or putting coal on our fires.  
I was gratified that many scientists agreed with us. As Tim Hansen, a climatologist and director 
of  NASA’s  Goddard  Institute  for  Space  Studies  in  New  York  City,  said,  ‘It  makes  much  more  
economic sense to find ways to address the climate problem directly by reducing the pollution that 
causes  it.’ 
The judges of the Virgin Earth Challenge include a NASA scientist and several top 
environmental researchers from around the world, including James Lovelock, Sir Crispin Tickell and 
Tim Flannery, who told me he was very excited by the potential. Almost as s oon as the prize was 
announced, the entries started coming in – 5,000 in the first month alone! We had so many entries that 
we asked a team at the University of Cambridge in England to appoint some of their people to work 
full-time at going through them to  assimilate and analyse and see if there were any real breakthroughs. 
It was agreed that it would be remarkable if any of the first applicants struck lucky. We are sure that 
we will get some crackpot ideas – but, promising or potty, it will only take one t o win.  
In the meantime, the US government, by doing nothing to tackle the problem, is helping to kill 
our  beautiful  world.  ‘They  go  on  in  strange  paradox,  decided  only  to  be  undecided,  resolved  to  be  
irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all p owerful  to  be  impotent,’  said  Winston  Churchill  
about  the  Chamberlain  government,  who  didn’t  believe  another  threat  in  the  1930s  was  real.  ‘The  era  
of  procrastination  is  coming  to  a  close.  In  its  place  we  are  entering  a  period  of  consequences,’  he  
conclude d. 
Three weeks later, I was enjoying a peaceful holiday with my family in Switzerland. We had spent the 
day – Friday 23 February 2007 – skiing and, late that night at 11 p.m., we were relaxing in the lovely 
little cinema in Zermatt, watching a French film with subtitles. The cinema had sofas and you could 
eat your supper from low tables. It was a very comfortable place to be after a hard day on the piste and 
I felt a little sleepy. My phone was off, but I felt it bleeping and vibrating in my pocket. It stop ped 
after eight or nine bleeps and I carried on watching the film.  
During my very first year of being in the travel business and owning an airline, if I ever had a call 
late  at  night  I’d  always  be  particularly  worried.  But  now,  I  realise  how  wonderfully  sa fe planes and 
trains are – and that night I felt I had no real reason to be worried when I got a late call. But there was 
something about this call that niggled in my mind so I finally decided to leave the cinema and stand 
outside to check my voicemail.  
I was alarmed when I was told that there had been an accident involving a Virgin train in the 
wilds of Cumbria – a remote, mountainous region in the northwest of England. I went back into the cinema to tell Joan and the kids and we hurried back to the hotel,  where I was able to phone around to 
arrange things.  
One of the first people I tried to reach was Will Whitehorn, who is also a director of Virgin 
Trains, but his phone just kept going to voicemail. Eventually, I found my list of emergency numbers 
and reac hed  Will’s  wife,  Lou,  in  East  Sussex.  I  could  hear  chatter  and  laughter  in  the  background.  
‘It’s  Will’s  birthday,  we’re  having  dinner  at  a  friend’s  house,’  Lou  said,  handing  the  phone  over  
to Will.  
For the first time in twenty years Will had left his phone  behind. He remembered it as they drove 
out  of  the  gate,  but  his  wife,  in  hindsight  memorably,  said,  ‘Don’t  worry   – nothing’s  going  to  happen  
tonight.’  But  he  knew  that  something  must  be  up  if  I  had  gone  to  the  trouble  of  tracking  down  Lou’s  
number and he was instantly alert.  
Briefly, I explained that there had been an accident to the 5.15 p.m. London Euston to Glasgow 
service. At that stage nobody knew how bad any injuries were or how many people had been hurt. I 
was told the train had gone down a ravine a nd the rescuers were having difficulty in reaching it. I said 
I was getting back to the UK as quickly as possible, but all the airports were closed. The first plane left 
Zurich for Heathrow at about 5 a.m. UK time.  
‘I’ll  see  if  I  can  find  out  more  this  end ,’  Will  said.  He  advised  me  that  if  it  were  a  major  accident  
– as it appeared to be – we  wouldn’t  be  able  to  get  a  train  north  from  Heathrow  to  near  the  crash  site.  
In the end, it proved easier to fly to Manchester and for him to meet me there.  
From Zermat t, I got a taxi for the five -hour drive down the mountain to Zurich and managed to 
get a direct flight to Manchester. I had plenty of time to think during that long night. I knew how 
disastrous train accidents could be. Even on a flat stretch of track, peo ple were often killed and scores 
could be horribly maimed and injured.  
By 2005 Virgin Trains had come out of the crisis period of the collapse of Railtrack and the 
formation of Network Rail. It had been tough, but things were running smoothly and our train s had 
fulfilled their promise. One of the things I was very proud of was the fact that the design of our 
Pendolino trains was unique. We had discussed our expectations with Alstom, the manufacturer, and 
outlined what we wanted. One thing we insisted was th at we were designing a train that should be the 
most environmentally friendly train ever built – and, in service, it had proved that. Despite the fact that 
their electricity comes from the British national grid, Pendolino trains boast the same carbon 
efficiency as the nuclear -powered  French  TGVs  (the  supremely  fast  ‘train  à  grande  vitesse’).  In  
Britain we instead use a much bigger mix of oil, gas, wind and some nuclear power, but, because our 
Pendolino train is more efficient than the TGV and has regenerati ve braking – the same as a Toyota 
Prius car – as well as an aircraft -type aluminium body shell, it emits 78 per cent less CO 2 than the 
equivalent airline seat to Manchester or Glasgow.  
The other feature we designed into the train was safety. When we asked Alstom to build it and 
gave them the specifications, we said we wanted them to look into every successful innovation in 
safety around the entire world and incorporate it into the new train. They were to do nothing that 
hadn’t  been  tried  and  tested  and  show n to work somewhere in the world. I said to Tony Collins – at 
the  time  he  was  Alstom’s  managing  director   – ‘I  want  you  to  bring  together  the  best  of  all  innovation  in the rail industry in the design of the train. We want a train that should be able to surv ive an accident 
at  full  speed,  regardless  of  the  cause,  and  the  passengers  should  be  able  to  walk  away  from  it.’  
It  was  a  very  tall  order,  but  I  didn’t  see  why  it  couldn’t  be  achievable.  Passengers  are  entitled  to  
know that all that could be done has been done to ensure their safety. Consequently, there was 
innovation at every level. The design of the linkages betwee n each carriage; the design of the carriages 
themselves; the design of all the interior fittings; the design of the windows – if there was an accident, 
the  windows  wouldn’t  smash  open  and  kill  the  passengers,  or  the  passengers  wouldn’t  be  hurled  out  of  
the train, as had happened in the Clapham disaster in 1988. The list of specifications was long.  
The other thing that happens in a lot of train disasters involving old rolling stock is that, because 
of the design of the bogies – the links that hold the wheels  on underneath – and the linkages (the 
connectivity) between each carriage, one carriage rides over the other one in accidents, crushing the 
carriage in front. Also, because of the old design of chassis with a body shell on top, one train can ride 
over ano ther and push the body shell across the top of the chassis and kill the people trapped inside – 
again, as happened in the Clapham disaster. So we decided to build exceptionally strong carriages, 
even though it made for a heavier and more expensive train. I n turn, to keep down the weight, we 
ordered what is termed monococh construction. That is, each carriage was a total aluminium cell, 
integral with the people in it. In effect, the passengers were in their own life -support system, even 
down to things like t he lighting, which was designed to stay on after an accident, and run off 
automatic batteries for three hours. I knew we had tried to do all we could to make the train as safe as 
possible; nevertheless, having received little information from the front lin e of the accident at 
Cumbria, I was worried.  
While I was making my way to Manchester, Will drove to Heathrow. The place was deserted, so 
he had a quick sleep under the British Midland check -in desk until he was woken up by the check -in 
staff, who put him o n the first plane to Manchester. Will and Tony Collins – the man who had made 
the Pendolino at Alstom and who now ran Virgin Trains – met  me  when  I  arrived.  We  didn’t  say  very  
much. We got in a hire car and the first thing we did was switch on the radio to  listen to the early 
morning news. The BBC had a running commentary and we would learn anything new as it happened. 
They  didn’t  know  how  many  people  had  been  killed  but,  to  our  great  relief,  there  were  already  police  
reports from the scene that stated that  the train was remarkably intact, which had contributed to the 
large number of survivors.  
I  turned  to  Tony  and  said,  ‘Well,  Tony,  you  built  a  bloody  good  train.’  
We sat and listened to the radio for about another five minutes, but there was still little 
information.  I  said  to  Will,  ‘Are  we  going  to  the  train  or  to  the  hospital  first?’  
‘The  first  thing  we’re  doing  is  going  to  go  to  the  hospital,’  Will  replied.  ‘I  don’t  know  what  we’ll  
find  there.  We’ve  phoned  ahead  and  they’re  expecting  you.  They’ve  taken  th e people to two separate 
hospitals.’ 
It was a long drive that cold and dank February dawn. England looked grey and grim compared 
to the dazzling Swiss Alps I had left. My mood was very introspective. As the chairman of the 
company I felt it was important t o take a lead, to get out there, talk to the emergency services, talk to 
people and treat them as you might members of your own family who had been caught up in a disaster. I knew I had to go to the hospitals, and was dreading finding how badly injured peo ple might 
be. The fact that they had used two hospitals sounded ominous.  
The thing that had shocked the staff in each hospital – and both the registrars mentioned it – was 
that when they heard about the accident and the conditions under which it had happen ed and as the 
pictures began filtering back that night from the scene from the helicopters flying to pick up the 
injured, they geared themselves up for over one hundred dead. The first reports from the scene were 
that there were over seventy to eighty casu alties. As it turned out, of that number, only twenty -five 
went to hospital. By the time we arrived in the early morning, there were only eleven people still in 
hospital with serious, though not life -threatening injuries, many of which were caused by a whi plash 
effect when the carriages rolled down the embankment. The driver, Iain Black – a former Glasgow 
policeman – was the most seriously injured, with a broken neck. It had taken two hours to release him 
from the cab, although the cab itself remained intac t. The other two seriously injured people were the 
children of a lady in her eighties, who had sadly died after she was brought to the hospital of heart 
failure.  
I remember the registrar at the first hospital we visited, the Royal Preston in Lancashire, sa ying, 
‘It’s  incredible.  Our  experience  of  train  crashes  and  the  reality  of  what  has  occurred  here  is  nothing  
short  of  a  miracle.’  
Miracle was a word we were to hear often as the morning unfolded. We visited the intensive care 
unit, but were unable to speak  to the driver because he was unconscious and being prepared for an 
operation. But we met the surgeon and he said he thought the driver was going to be all right. We were 
leaving that hospital when we got accosted by a reporter from the News of the World . I said a few 
words to them and went on to the Royal Lancashire Infirmary, where we found that most people had 
been discharged. Again, I offered my help; and then we went quickly on to the scene of the accident. 
The surrounding lanes and fields were very wa terlogged and the site was inaccessible by car. The 
police had cordoned off the approach and, displaying a little bit of bureaucracy, they asked who I was. 
I told them, but they still refused us access until they had radioed ahead to make sure that it was OK 
for me to go and look at my own train. Escorted by police, we walked about a mile towards the 
railway line, which lay across fields. As we got closer, we could see smoke rising and I instantly 
remembered the dreadful flash fire of the Clapham disaster.  
When  you  don’t  know  what  to  expect   – when  you  don’t  know  how  many  people  are  going  to  end  
up as casualties, whether your driver will live or die, or whether there is something that has been done 
or not done by your crew – and when you arrive at the scene a nd you see the train looking like a 
Dinky Toy set thrown everywhere, there is a sense of unreality. It was ghastly; but wonderful that it 
had stood up to the accident so well. It was impossible to prepare yourself for this. You think about 
the world of pub lic relations and suchlike and how people have written statements and seem so 
controlled. But my experience is that you can never be prepared for situations like the one we were 
walking  towards.  It  was  important  to  avoid  the  ‘don’t  apologise’  industry  appr oach by appearing on 
the scene of the accident to apologise, to reassure and to make it quite clear that we would take 
responsibility if responsibility had to be taken and that we would discover what had caused the 
accident. It seemed to be the logical and  the human way to handle the situation. But, of course, 
lawyers and insurance people always advise people not to do that.  We knew a lot about the history of rail accidents because we had studied them. One of the big 
issues was the appalling communications,  which made things worse, especially for families and 
friends. So one of the models we tried to create when we planned for a potential accident scenario was 
fast, efficient and honest communications from the word go. When we arrived at the scene there had 
been very little in the way of communication from anybody who was there, apart from the police, who 
had  already  held  a  press  conference  that  morning  at  the  site.  They’d  said  that  they  suspected  it  was  
track failure at the points and the train was not at th e centre of their inquiries. This was a great relief 
for us; though obviously not for the chief executive of Network Rail who was already there – a very 
nice man called John Armitt (who has gone on to run the infrastructure of the British Olympics). 
Robin Gisby, director of operations and customer services for Network Rail, who was with John, 
explained to us again that the cause was most likely points failure. The nine carriages had rolled off 
the bank but most of them had managed to stay upright – clearly they had been thrown into the air 
while travelling at 95 miles an hour – and most of them seemed intact. John and Robin showed us 
where it had happened and how the train must have come off the tracks before travelling for some 
distance along the stone chip pings.  
John  just  looked  at  me  and  simply  said,  ‘Sorry.’  I  knew  exactly  how  he  felt  and  how  overcome  he  
must have been.  
It was time to make a statement to the gathered press, who had been herded at a safe distance 
below the embankment by the police. I had a lways laughed at funny films and cried at sad ones and 
my  children  always  took  a  box  of  tissues  for  me.  Mum  always  said,  when  public  speaking,  don’t  think  
of  yourself  but  of  who  you  are  talking  to.  Thankfully,  as  I  faced  the  press,  my  emotions  didn’t  get  t he 
better of me. Obviously, it would have been far more difficult if the cause had seemed to be something 
we were responsible for. It was still an emotional moment, though, when one reporter said there was a 
hundred -foot viaduct seconds away and it was pur e luck, a matter of seconds, that the train had 
stopped in time.  
I  didn’t  know  a  great  deal  at  that  stage  of  what  had  actually  occurred,  but  I  praised  the  bravery  of  
the driver who stayed at his post and managed to slow and control the train as much as pos sible:  ‘It  is  
a very sad day because of the loss of one life and the injuries caused to other people. The actions of 
the emergency services, the RAF and the police in dealing with the crash were wonderful. The driver 
of the train, Iain Black, deserves reco gnition. He came around a corner to find the line defective before 
the train started to leave the line. He carried on sitting in his carriage for nearly half a mile, running 
the train on the stone. He could have tried to get back and protect himself but he  didn’t,  and  he’s  
ended up quite badly injured. He is definitely a hero. In the sober light of day we will have to see if he 
can  be  recognised  as  such.’  
I  continued,  ‘The  train  itself  was  magnificent   – it’s  built  like  a  tank.  I  think,  if  it  had  been  any  of  
the old trains, the injuries and the mortalities would have been horrendous. Each carriage is built like a 
motor racing car with rolling bars. Not one of the carriages has crumpled; hardly any of the windows 
have been broken. Everyone is going to have to learn from this incident and Network Rail are going to 
have  to  look  at  this  track  problem  and  make  sure  nothing  like  this  ever  happens  again.’  
When  asked  why  I  had  come  to  the  scene  of  the  accident  in  person,  I  replied,  ‘You  know,  the  
thing  is  I’m  here  not  as the boss of this company. I am here because I am a human being and, if my 
children had been in that train, I would have expected the owner of the train company to come and learn from it and to go to the hospital and show sympathy to the relatives. And I think people would 
expect  the  same  of  me.  You  keep  asking  me  whose  fault  it  is.  We  don’t  know  the  answer  to  that  yet;;  
but, clearly, it is some form of track failure and the train is not at the centre of the investigation. That 
will come out in the fullne ss of time. The only thing that we have to take away from today is to learn 
lessons  for  the  future,  to  make  sure  that  something  like  this  never  happens  again.’  
After talking to the press I went to visit all the emergency services that remained. The helicop ters 
and  ambulances  had  gone  and  the  remaining  services  were  winding  down  from  the  night’s  activities  
and were getting ready to do the more forensic work on the train. Chief Superintendent Martyn Ripley 
of the British Transport Police said forensic experts , engineers, scenes of crime officers and accident 
investigators  were  working  on  the  scene.  ‘All  of  us  who  were  involved  were  amazed  that  we  didn’t  get  
more   fatalities   at   the   time.   We   were   very,   very   fortunate.’   This   opinion   was   backed   up   by  
Superintendent  Jon  Rush,  of  Cumbria  Police,  who  said,  ‘It  is  a  scene  of  devastation.  We  were  very  
surprised  that  there  have  been  so  few  fatalities.’  
After the uncertainty of the morning, I felt a great relief that things were far better than we had 
originally imagined – even though I continued to feel very aware of the poor woman who had died, 
and the others who were injured. As we walked away from the scene of the accident, Tony said, 
‘Richard,  you  probably  won’t  remember  this,  but  you  were  the  one  who  sat  at  the  first   meeting we had 
as  the  train  manufacturer  and  said,  “I  want  to  build  the  safest  train  in  the  world.”’  
Next, we went to the farmhouse next to the track to thank Geoff Burrows, the farmer who owned 
the field where the train crashed, for his help. He had suppl ied the passengers with sandwiches and tea 
and had helped the rescue effort by pulling cars and ambulances out of the muddy ground with his 
tractor. Finally, we went back to the Royal Lancashire Infirmary to meet the family of Mrs Margaret 
Masson, the lady  who had died. They wanted to meet me in the morgue. However difficult it might 
have been for me, it was obviously far worse for them and I knew it was the right thing to do to be 
there and talk to them – as much as one can in those circumstances. I sat wi th them feeling deeply 
moved. They never looked to me for an explanation. We shared their grief together.  
Obviously, as a company, we later analysed how everything was handled and how we could learn 
from the accident. I was genuinely very proud of the way the Virgin team had handled things. Long 
ago, we had put emergency plans in place and they had swung smoothly into action. Because the 
entire London to Glasgow line had to be closed, some twenty to thirty thousand passengers were stuck 
up and down the rail way line. We hired virtually every spare taxi in Britain and every single passenger 
was  home  in  a  taxi  by  one  o’clock  that  morning.  We  had  carers  on  the  scene  at  the  hospital  and  the  site  
of the crash. The counselling of the injured people and the families  was carried out on a one -to-one 
basis by the staff – that is continuing as I write. How people deal with adversity is important and they 
did so well. The driver was released from hospital after a month and I was told he would fully recover. 
Hopefully,  he’ ll be back driving.  
During  our  analysis  a  great  irony  surfaced:  we’d  had  to  fight  the  government  to  allow  us  to  build  
our Pendolino train to high specifications. When the media repeatedly reported that the survival rate in 
the  accident  was  ‘a  miracle’  I  wa nted  to  say  it  wasn’t  a  miracle.  If  it  was  a  miracle,  it  was  a  miracle  by  
design, in the sense that if you plan properly for some eventuality and make no compromises to the 
solutions to that possible eventuality, then you can build unprecedented levels of safety into any 
transport system. Virgin has a proud record of safety – we’ve  never  lost  a  passenger  in  an  air  accident  in twenty -five  years  of  flying.  And  we’d  had  ten  years  of  operating  trains  by  the  time  Cumbria  
happened and never lost a single passenge r – until  now.  Mrs  Masson’s  death  was  a  real  tragedy  and  I  
was  angry  that  every  argument  we’d  had  over  those  trains,  ludicrously,  was  with  the  government,  with  
many  civil  servants  advising  ministers  that  we  had  ‘overspecified’  the  train.  And  as  a  result,  t hey’d  
said  it  was  ‘too  heavy’  and  ‘too  expensive’!  
That train went into that accident with no faults whatsoever – yet  they  insisted  that  we’d  had  
‘needless’  systems  built  into  it,  such  as  an  automatic  computer  system  that  monitored  the  entire  train  
and sen t back a satellite signal to our headquarters in Birmingham which would inform headquarters if 
any fault ever developed on any Pendolino. Unlike in previous accidents in the rail industry – where 
people were kept waiting for years to find out the answer, w hich causes enormous distress to families 
– we could walk into that situation in Cumbria and honestly report that that train had arrived there 
with no faults on it. To compare, the technology that Network Rail has to monitor its tracks and points 
is still decades  behind  the  train  that’s  travelling  on  them.  
If you look at the health and safety regulations in Britain, the Virgin Pendolino surpasses the 
regulatory minimums for safety in its systems by a factor of three. That was what the civil servants 
meant b y over -specified. It was built well above and beyond even current safety standards in the UK. 
It’s  now  causing  a  lot  of  hand  wringing  in  government,  with  people  wondering  what  to  do  about  the  
fact that new trains are being built right now that are not to t he same standard of safety specifications 
as the Pendolino.  
Whilst   the   tracks   our   trains   are   running   on   aren’t   as   modern,   there   is   no   excuse   for   bad  
maintenance. But at least it was good to see the head of Network Rail taking it on the chin and 
accepting r esponsibility within twenty -four hours.  
The handling of the accident has become a BBC case study for new journalists on standards that 
BBC reporters should expect from corporate organisations. They said Virgin had set a new standard 
for the management and the handling of emergencies of this nature. A director at the BBC was on the 
train and, while still stuck in her carriage, she witnessed the way the accident was handled – and how 
the events unfolded afterwards and how they were in turn dealt with. As an e yewitness she was highly 
impressed by the conduct of our people, by the procedures that were followed.  
Very  few  people  knew  that  we’d  taken  some  big  decisions  in  the  previous  twelve  months  about  
whether or not we wanted to stay in the rail industry. Now th at the Pendolino was up and running and 
we were growing passenger numbers fast and taking real market share from the airlines on routes like 
London to Manchester, Liverpool or Glasgow, the business was finally becoming profitable – and 
there were lots of p eople out there who wanted to buy it from us. We had had to decide whether or not 
to stay in rail. In the early years, until huge sums were poured into upgrading the railways, we had 
caught a lot of flak from critics. This had caused problems for the Virgi n brand and we had had many 
discussions over whether or not to expand in the business. The delivery of the Pendolinos and then 
getting them into service convinced us to stay in. Interestingly, by the time the Cumbria accident had 
happened, we had decided t o expand in the business and start bidding for other franchises. In 2007 we 
made a bid to run the East Coast line and take it over from GNER, whose parent company went bust, 
but the route was awarded to National Express.  I’m  a  great  believer  in  rail   – and I do think a new age of the train is coming in Europe. I would go 
further and say that I think that we are going to get to the stage from an environmental perspective 
whereby decent fast and efficient train services should operate between cities in the fut ure, instead of 
domestic  airlines.  It  will  require  continued  investment  for  both  Britain’s  network  and  the  rest  of  
Europe’s.  Ironically,  despite  the  public  perception,  Britain  is  investing  more  into  railways  than  any  
other country in Europe now and our rai lways are becoming the best in Europe. As the Financial 
Times  pointed out in a major editorial piece in the spring of 2007, the general public only sees the 
French  TGVs.  What  they  don’t  realise  is  that  most  French  commuter  trains  are  now  over  fifty  years  
old and are providing a terrible service to commuters into Paris and the other major cities of France. 
Britain may not have the fastest railways, but they are at last on their way to becoming amongst the 
best.  It’s  a  trend  that  will  only  become  a  reality  if  that investment continues, however.  
For the travel industry managers who are reading this, the whole value of the Pendolino contract 
was £1.2 billion. We set up the contract in a unique way in that the manufacturer had to take 
responsibility for maintaini ng  the  train  and  looking  after  it  throughout  its  life:  it  was  called  a  ‘design,  
build  and  maintain’  contract.  They  only  got  half  their  money  for  building  the  train;;  the  other  half  they  
would get over the life of the train for safely maintaining it. Now the  motive of that, which had never 
previously dawned on the rail industry, but which we had begun to learn in the airline industry, was 
that,  if  you’re  a  manufacturer  and  you’ve  built  trains  which  you  then  hand  over  to  somebody,  the  
incentive to build to the  very  best  standards  can  never  be  as  high  as  if  you’re  going  to  have  to  maintain  
and be paid to maintain. Obviously, in the latter case, a manufacturer will want to make that 
maintenance as easy and as efficient as possible. This will also generally mean t hat you will also build 
much more safety into the regime.  
Of the total of £1.2 billion, £600 million was to build the trains and the remaining £600 million 
was paid out for maintenance over the life of the trains. Each Pendolino cost an average of £11.5 
million per train – which we were told was about £1.5 millio n too expensive. Part of that cost was for 
regenerative braking. However, we insisted on fitting regenerative braking, which puts back 17 per 
cent of all the electricity these trains use into the overhead wires every time they brake. At the time we 
decided  to go ahead with that, oil was only $10 a barrel and there were certainly plenty of people in 
the  Department  of  Transport  who  couldn’t  understand  why  we  would  ‘waste  money’,  given  how  
cheap  energy  was.  They  were  missing  the  point.  If  you’re  going  to  have   to operate trains for twenty 
years you never know what the price of energy is going to be in the future, and you have to plan for 
more expensive energy – which was something that we at Virgin believed by 1999 was going to 
happen, against the trend of the t ime. But, even back in 1999, the more I looked to the future of energy 
and oil, the more I looked at environmental issues, and the more I was convinced we had to do 
something.  That’s  when  the  regenerative  braking  decision  was  taken.  The  other  thing  that  we  spent 
more on was the safety aspect of the trains. But, if you look at the reality today, we have already paid 
back the cost of the regenerative braking in the lower energy use and the lower environmental impact 
of the trains – and, as for the safety feat ures, this one accident alone has caused less misery and less 
social cost than any 100mph accident with a train anywhere in the world in history. The train that was 
in the Cumbria accident will go back into service – which some people find hard to believe.  But only 
two coaches were damaged enough to be taken out of service. The rest of the train is in very good 
shape and has passed all safety tests.  
On a further environmental note, red diesel was the low tax fuel during World War II for industry 
and  agriculture,  and  has  remained  so  for  agriculture  ever  since.  I  don’t  see  why  biofuel  should  not  benefit from this same tax break, since we are helping red uce CO 2 emissions. I went to see Gordon 
Brown,  the  then  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  and  discussed  these  issues  with  him.  I’m  pleased  to  say  
that he agreed with me, and in the subsequent budget he gave us the tax break we needed, so that on 7 
June 2007 the  first passenger -carrying biofuel train, the Virgin Voyager – the diesel version of the 
Pendolino – went into service on the London to Holyhead route. It was not only a first for the UK but 
for the whole of Europe.  
As a postscript, the final irony of the e vents of 23 –24 February in Cumbria is that, the Monday 
after the accident, a letter of complaint was received at our head office from a member of the public. 
He wrote that he was unable to use his mobile phone from the Pendolino he was travelling in, becau se 
of the small windows and special metallic fillers. This safety feature protects the passengers from 
shattering glass, but does make for smaller than usual windows and damages mobile phone reception. 
We’ve  not,  however,  had  another  complaint  since!  Havin g said that, in the near future new technology 
will allow people to use their phones uninterrupted.  
Meanwhile, I had been keeping a watching brief on our work in South Africa, and towards the end of 
April, I flew to there to open our new hospital. It had a ll come about because of Donald and Dyke, and 
to  make  sure  we  didn’t  lose  any  of  our  staff  or  community  again.  It  set  alarm  bells  ringing  and  I  was  
determined  to  make  sure  it  didn’t  happen  again.  The  doctors,  Hugo  Templeman  and  Brian  Brink,  who  
I had met t he previous year, were there as well, to help with the grand opening, when Africans, in their 
tribal costumes, danced outside and many people from the local area came to check us out. Hugo had 
worked on the building plans and Brian helped us do fundraising . The entire building had gone up in 
less than eight months, including fitting it out, at a remarkably low cost. With the doors open, ready to 
treat thousands of people, it cost just a million dollars. The equivalent hospital built from scratch in 
England would cost $100 million and take years. We put in $600,000, Anglo American $400,000 and 
the US government will also be putting in $5 million over some years to pay for antiretroviral drugs 
and other medicines. It is a complete clinic, with four maternity w ards and twenty -four-hour care for 
full HIV, AIDS, TB and malaria treatment, as well as all the basic healthcare services.  
The vision behind the quick, efficient build was to get the hospital up and running to start treating 
people at once without hanging around discussing plans and issues. We just raised the money and did 
it. Our idea was to try to build in a much more efficient and portable way than has been done in the 
past,  using  as  a  model  a  method  that  converts  the  ubiquitous  ‘charity’  into  a  sustaina ble business 
model – that is, it will ultimately become self -running and pay for itself. I feel that helping people 
towards self -sufficiency where possible gives them more hope and confidence and can take them out 
of a cycle of poverty and despair. We used  as  a  blueprint  Hugo  Templeman’s  Centre,  where  he  has  
helped HIV/AIDS patients who are being treated to set up small businesses around the clinic, so they 
can  make  a  living  and  have  some  dignity.  Using  Hugo’s  model,  we  agreed  that  HIV/AIDS,  malaria  
and TB would all be treated free; but there would be a charge for basic healthcare and less urgent 
treatment where people could afford it. It was important, though, for the people to know that we would 
never turn anyone away. Our aim ideally is to take that as a model and scale it up across South Africa, 
then as many other places as possible where there is real need through Virgin Unite. Creating 
sustainable  businesses  frees  ‘charity’  money  to  be  used  elsewhere  and  effectively  stretches  it  further.  
It was a few da ys later that I got the welcome news that scientist Stephen Hawking had come one step 
closer to his dream of going into space with us. On 27 April, shortly after his sixty -fifth birthday, with 
the help of Peter Diamandis and a team of doctors and nurses, h e finally experienced zero gravity on board a commercial 727 jet that had been converted for weightless training flights – or what NASA 
astronauts -in-training  call  the  ‘Vomit  Comet’.  Just  to  make  sure  he  would  be  all  right,  he  took  a  
motion sickness pill j ust before his flight. He was the first person with a disability to enjoy the 
experience – and enjoy it he did. The video beamed back to us on Earth showed a wide smile on his 
face as he left the confines of his wheelchair and floated free for the first ti me.  ‘It  was  amazing  …  I  
could  have  gone  on  and  on,’  he  said  after  landing.  ‘Space,  here  I  come.’  
I  can’t  know  exactly  how  he  felt  at  having  achieved  the  first  part  of  his  dream   – only he could 
possibly know that – but I know what it feels like to float at zero-g. On first leaving the gravity of 
Earth, the feeling of weightlessness travels slowly through the body until, suddenly, instant bliss fills 
you.  Everyone  who  has  ever  known  it  agrees  that  it  is  ‘pure,  sheer  ecstasy’   – but words alone cannot 
describe the pleasure. Having passed the test with flying colours, Professor Hawking was now ready 
to be a passenger aboard a Virgin Galactic space flight.  
Not everything would go as smoothly, or even as joyfully, as flying at zero -g. Eighteen months 
earlier, on 11  September 2005, an interesting opportunity came my way. I was in New York for the 
US Open tennis finals, when I attended a lunch meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel with Gordon 
McCallum,  head  of  Virgin’s  management  company,  Simon  Duffy,  CEO  of  the  UK  cable   television 
company  NTL,  and  Shai  Weiss,  NTL’s  director  of  operations   – who now runs Virgin Fuels. Simon 
and Shai had flown in that morning for the meeting. It was the culmination of months of secret 
negotiations between us to create a new powerhouse media company in the UK to rival Sky. Our 
codename for the proposed union was Project Baseball; like a baseball pitch it had four bases (a 
‘quadplay’)  with  a  diamond  in  the  middle.  The  diamond  was  the  value  to  be  unlocked  by  our  merger.  
Originally, NTL/Telewest had asked if we would license the brand to them, but I thought we 
could  do  a  lot  better.  In  discussions  with  Stephen  Murphy,  our  chief  executive,  I  said,  ‘Virgin  Mobile  
is sitting here with 4.5 million customers and a lot of rights in terms of content. The  only way I can 
see  this  working  is  to  integrate  Virgin  Mobile  into  the  new  business.’  I  didn’t  just  want  to  do  a  
rebranding deal, I wanted to have equity. As I saw it, they were going to have to rename and rebrand 
anyway – and Virgin had by far the better  image.  
Simon and Gordon agreed. This was that NTL and Telewest – the  UK’s  biggest  cable  providers   – 
should  combine  together  with  Virgin  Mobile,  to  rebrand  the  new  group  with  Virgin’s  name  and  very  
successful image. Together we would have some ten million customers, which would enable us to do 
wonderful  things.  The  first  selling  point  would  be  to  launch  ‘quadplay’   – that is, we would offer a 
‘four  for  £40  service’  in  one  package  of  digital  TV,  broadband,  telephone  and  mobile  telephone.  I  
liked the fun and b usiness coup in this unusual reverse take -over. NTL/Telewest was effectively 
buying Virgin Mobile for a very large sum – but I would become the largest shareholder and stamp 
our name and logo on the entire company. I immediately saw it as a way of unlockin g the huge 
potential in Virgin Mobile and, at the same time, having the fun of becoming a major competitor in the 
market place. I had tried before, when I had bid for Channel 5 (now Five) and knew how difficult it 
could be. It took eighteen months to fine -tune the proposal before a fifteen -page summary was sent to 
me early in 2007. Obviously, the structure of the deal took many more sheets of paper, but I have 
always preferred summaries: I am able to see at a glance whether a deal is for me or not, by cutti ng to 
the chase and skimming the main points.  During the long months of negotiation, we had managed to keep the deal secret by working 
through only one bank and not even telling Charles Gurassa, the independent chairman at Virgin 
Mobile – but ultimately it  leaked. The Sunday Telegraph  wrote:  ‘James  Murdoch  is  going  to  choke  on  
his  muesli  when  he  hears  about  this.  It’s  going  to  be  the  battle  of  the  brands   – Virgin vs.  Sky.’ 
T-Mobile, who were involved with Virgin Mobile, had a change of control provision in their deal 
with  us.  Obviously,  with  the  leak  about  to  go  public,  they  had  to  be  told.  They  weren’t  told  everything  
– such as the NTL/Telewest proposal – but someone there guessed. It ended up with Gordon urgently 
calling  Charles  Gurassa  and  saying,  ‘There’ s  something  you  need  to  know  …’  
We formally became Virgin Media on 6 February 2007. Part of our strategy in order to give us 
content was to identify and then make a bid for ITV. It was well known that ITV was struggling in the 
market place, but it had a go od base for us to make and buy in content. We thought we had a good 
chance, until we came up against quite a big player in the form of Rupert Murdoch – who owns more 
than 50 per cent of all UK media, from TV to newspapers. I knew we would end up locking ho rns 
with Sky, but I underestimated the speed with which Murdoch moved. His son, James, runs Sky, but 
there is little doubt that his strings are pulled by Murdoch senior. I get on well with both Murdochs, 
though I am aware of how ruthless they can be in bus iness. Our bid for ITV suddenly fell apart on 26 
April when Rupert Murdoch stepped in and bought a large slice of ITV shares at well over their value. 
As  a  result,  Sky  shares  immediately  lost  £150  million  in  value  but  they  didn’t  mind  that  to  stop  us  
becom ing too powerful a competitor. I believe that what they did under competition law was unfair 
and illegal and we asked the competition authorities to adjudicate on whether Murdoch could buy 
those ITV shares or not. Some of the competitive reaction undertake n by Sky was also somewhat 
unexpected.  We  had  three  million  homes  against  Sky’s  nine  million  homes,  but,  cleverly,  Murdoch  
senior had tried to paint a picture that I was portraying myself as a David vs Goliath, whereas – 
according to him – it was Goliath v s Goliath. I believed that the two Murdochs and I have quite a lot 
of respect for each other, but the game, as Sherlock Holmes said, was afoot.  
Until then, Sky and the new entity, Virgin Media, had a symbiotic relationship, in that we had 
channels on each other’s  networks.  We  paid  quite  a  lot  of  money  to  Sky  for  their  basic  channels;;  but,  
with no warning, suddenly they asked us for a lot more money than the market value, or than we were 
willing to pay, because those channels were declining in numbers of vie wers. At the same time, they 
decided to reduce what they paid us to use our network by tens of millions of pounds, despite an 
increase  in  viewers  of  our  programming.  As  a  result  our  customers  lost  some  of  Sky’s  programming,  
but we were eventually able to s ettle the issue at the end of 2008.  
I  hadn’t  been  at  Ulusaba  very  long  when  I  became  more  fully  aware  that  animals  know  no  boundaries  
or  frontiers.  Some  people  talk  of  ‘Kenyan  elephants’  and  ‘South  African  lions’,  but  the  reality  is  that  
most animals have always followed their old hunting and feeding paths, regardless of man -made 
borders. Like migrating birds, they are gypsies, going where they will. It is only when they come up 
against the needs of people to grow crops or to build towns that the problems d evelop.  
Africa was divided up like a pack of cards in the Victorian era, when European colonialism was 
at its height. Artificial political borders cut across tribal lands and split clans; as well as across 
animals’  migration  routes,  fragmenting  and  destroy ing ecosystems and biodiversity. It was to try to 
right this damage that national parks were established. However, most national parks are exactly that – 
national and within borders. Peace Parks, under the guidance of Dr Anton Rupert, went to the next stage. Together with Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and Mandela, Dr Rupert set up the Peace 
Parks Foundation. Their dream was to once again create an Africa where wildlife can roam freely 
across international borders. Co -operation between countries would a llow eco -tourists to come, 
bringing in money, work and prosperity to some abjectly poor people and regions. The people, 
animals and the land of Africa would all benefit.  
According  to  Dr  Rupert,  ‘We  believe  in  the  philosophy  that  there  needs  to  be  harmony  b etween 
humans and nature. Africa without fences. We dream of ancient migration trails trodden deep by an 
instinct that time has never contained. We dream of a wilderness where the elephant roams and the 
roar  of  the  lion  shatters  the  night.’  
Ulusaba is with in the great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA) that stretches 
across the entire area of southern Africa, from coast to coast. But I was very attracted to the idea of the 
Peace Parks when I learned that they will eventually straddle the globe, taking in some of the most 
beautiful and remote places, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and east to west around the globe – some 
112 countries in all are involved. But although the Parks are without borders, every country retains 
absolute sovereignty of the  part  of  the  Park  that  falls  within  its  territory.  It’s  an  amazing  achievement  
and I loved the concept when Mandela first mentioned it to me.  
In  due  course,  in  January  2006  Professor  Willem  Van  Riet  approached  me  to  join  Club  21.  ‘21’  
stands for those i nterested in peace and development through conservation in the twenty -first century. 
Each  member  of  the  club  makes  a  minimum  contribution  of  one  million  dollars.  It’s  a  lot  of  money   – 
but  I  agreed  with  Dr  Rupert’s  witty  quip  that,  ‘Conservation  without  mon ey  is  just  Conversation.’  
But all was not wonderful in paradise. The reality, as I found, was the amount of land set aside 
for wildlife in Africa is tiny. Farms encroach, poachers poach and in some areas – such as a beautiful 
area of Mozambique – there’s  no  game  left  because  of  civil  war.  But  in  South  Africa’s  Kruger  Park,  
there’s  too  much  game.  The  more  I  got  involved,  the  more  I  realised  how  crucial  the  work  of  the  
Peace Parks is. One of the most exciting breakthroughs was the removal of the border fence between 
South Africa and Mozambique. Now the over -populated elephants of the Kruger can move freely into 
Mozambique and breathe life into its deserted game parks.  
Things moved at great speed. By April 2007, I was flying to Kenya to finalise an initiative t o lease 
land from the traditional home of the Masai. The plan was to pay them more money than they 
currently got from farming, to protect the land as well as the beautiful migrations of the wildebeest – 
one of the five wonders of the world – and to then tr ain the Masai to work in game lodges, as rangers, 
so they continue to work on their own land. It helps to improve the environment, gives them jobs, and 
protects wild animals. I think that some countries realise that what they have is absolutely priceless; 
and this is especially true of Africa, where they have to battle with the climate as well as with famine, 
war and disease. Fortunately, African governments and the African people themselves are coming to 
see that the game and scenery is beyond value. Once you  lose  it,  you’re  never  going  to  get  it  back.  At  
least 10 per cent of our profits have been put aside to invest in Africa and to create African jobs. 
We’ve  set  up  a  national  airline  for  the  Nigerians,  which  West  Africa  desperately  needed,  as  well  as  
health clubs, mobile phone companies and finance companies, together employing some 5,000 
Africans.  As I stood in the steamy heat of Kenya, though, breathing in the rich smells of the Tropics, I 
mentally braced myself for the sub -zero temperatures I was about to experience on my next challenge 
– which was to take some time off to trek across a part of the Arctic Circle with my son, Sam, and 
husky dog teams. Sam had already been training for a week when I arrived from Kenya – which 
wasn’t  the  best  place  to  adapt  myself to Arctic conditions! – to  join  Will  Steger’s  1,200 -mile Global 
Warming 101 expedition to help alert the world to what global warming was doing to the Arctic and 
the Inuit and the world as a whole. By the time I arrived – hotfoot (almost literally! ) from Africa, to 
travel  with  the  team  from  the  Clyde  River  to  journey’s  end  at  the  Iglulik   – global warming rapidly 
became one of the last things on my mind. The Inuits, who were our guides, keenly observed and 
pointed out to us some depressing changes in  the permanent ice cover.  
But first I had to brave the welcoming feast. A tarpaulin was laid out in the middle of the village 
hall. Three frozen stag heads, cut off from their frozen bodies that lay next to them, stared out at us. 
Chunks of raw frozen meat  cut from one of the stags awaited us. Large frozen fish lay in a row. This 
was the feast the Inuit had laid on for us at Clyde River to help us on our way.  
The next day, we headed down from Clyde Fjord – a glaciated valley that was flooded by sea 
water. I t was awesome; certainly one of the wonders of the world. I felt completely dwarfed with our 
tiny sledges in the middle of this great fjord. It was a beautiful wilderness, one I had never 
experienced from the ground before – although I had sailed serenely overhead similar terrain in a 
balloon. I was also conscious of the fact that my ancestor, the man known as Scott of the Antarctic, 
had walked through far worse conditions to the South Pole.  
Every mile we covered was through the most beautiful scenery I had  ever seen, with blue ice and 
soaring sea cliffs; but Theo, our guide, also pointed out other disturbing signs. As the sea is getting 
warmer the killer whales are moving north in ever increasing numbers. The eider ducks and 
phalaropes are now staying north  all year round instead of just the summer. Even in the dark of winter, 
when  there’s  just  two  hours  of  sunlight,  they  stay.  The  ground  squirrel  that  used  to  be  found  250  miles  
south  of  Theo’s  village  Iglulik  is  now  flourishing  around  Iglulik.  They  are  gett ing new species of 
birds. Even the robin has arrived for the first time.  
Theo  said,  ‘When  we  first  heard  about  global  warming  we  Inuits  thought  it  was  good  news.  Our  
kids  would  have  warmer  winters.  Now  we  know  it’s  not  good  news.  It  is  changing  the  ecosyst em 
altogether.  This  beautiful  world  we  live  in  is  going  to  disappear.’  
I  wrote  some  interesting  things  in  my  journal.  Here’s  one  especially  notable  entry:  ‘My  last  night  
was particularly cold. We all have a piss bottle in our beds due to it being too cold to get out in the 
night.  I  didn’t  do  the  top  of  the  bottle  up  tightly  enough.  Woke  up  to  find  my  sleeping  bag  consisted  of  
frozen piss. I told the story the next day and everyone generally agreed – since  the  Inuits  don’t  allow  
alcohol – that I was the only  person  to  get  pissed  on  this  trip!’  
I managed to do a satellite telephone link -up and talked to my dad. Dad had spent a lot of the 
War in the Sahara desert, fighting Rommel. It can be very cold in the desert at night. After I had 
described my adventures w ith  the  frozen  bottle,  Dad  said  dryly,  ‘In  the  War  we’d  fill  our  hot  water  
bottles  with  tea  so  we  could  keep  warm  at  night  and  have  a  cuppa  in  the  morning.’  It  was  a  good  thing  
that  I  didn’t  confuse  his  story  with  mine.  Seeing Sam in his element, easily ab le to keep up with the fittest in the party – equally at home 
amongst the Inuit as he is amongst Africans or on the islands of the Caribbean where he has been 
largely brought up – made  me  see  how  very  grown  up  and  capable  he  had  become.  It’s  always  an  
evoc ative and poignant moment when the older generation looks at the younger one and sees them 
catching up, or overtaking. Sam and I have avoided the subject of if he would or would not run Virgin 
one day. It gets very involved because I am still having a grea t deal of fun and, even though I have 
been  working  hard  since  I  was  fifteen,  I  don’t  see  retirement  looming,  not  even  on  the  far  horizon.  I  
also have to consider that Sam wants to prove himself and that there are plenty of his own things he 
wants to do; an d Holly, of course, has never veered from her dreams of becoming a doctor. Recently, 
she qualified and is now working as a houseman in a big London hospital. As well as attending music 
college – he plays good guitar – Sam spent some four months helping wit h the relaunch of Virgin 
Media, which he enjoyed. Some of our businesses, like Virgin Media, have a youthful image and, as I 
head towards sixty, I have to consider that as well. I am aware that a recent survey we did on the 
Virgin brand gratifyingly showed  that it was the Number One most popular brand in the UK; but also 
shows  that  amongst  young  people  it  was  losing  its  popularity  slightly.  If  I  am  honest,  I  think  that’s  a  
reflection of my age. Time moves on and, therefore, having a younger person in the pu blic eye at 
some  stage  would  help,  though  it’s  not  as  important  at  the  moment  with  things  like  Virgin  Money  and  
Virgin Trains.  
I   do   realise   as   I   get   older   that   I’m   going   to   be   able   to   do   less   to   promote   Virgin;;   and  
philosophically I hope I will need to do less to promote it, since the ideas inculcated in the company 
are enshrined enough in the way it works to make the businesses t ake on lives of their own – hopefully 
in keeping with the ideas of the founder. If an organisation is structured in the right way there is no 
reason  why  its  ethos  shouldn’t  survive  the  death  of  the  founder  or  even  a  change  of  ownership.  Look  
at John Lewis:  it remains absolutely in line with the principles of its first founder. Marks & Spencer 
may have lost its way for a while but the public never lost track of its vision of what M&S should be 
and the company has had to return to that vision. Another example  is Rolls -Royce. Long after the 
deaths of its two founders, its principle of engineering excellence still reassures people as diverse as 
airline  passengers  and  tank  drivers  the  world  over.  So,  when  I’m  too  old  or  incapacitated  to  abseil  
down a building, I still think the spirit of fun and adventure will be there – although  I’m  still  
constantly assured that they will be hoisting me up and down that building in a wheelchair. Still, that 
moment might be a very long way off. Sam certainly thinks so. When he was  at Virgin Media he was 
asked  to  do  an  interview.  Virgin  PR,  Jackie  McQuillan,  said  to  him,  ‘Well,  if  you  want  to  do  the  
interview,  babe,  you  can,  but  let’s  just  talk  about  you  working  for  Virgin   – not some psycho -babble 
about your relationship with your d ad.’ 
To  which  Sam  replied,  ‘Aw,  Jackie,  do  we  really  have  to  push  the  fact  that  I’m  working  for  
Virgin this soon – I’m  going  to  have  to  put  up  with  another  sixty  years  of  this  shit!’  
After the Arctic expedition, it seemed appropriate that, while in the gre at North, I stopped off in 
Toronto  to  launch  another  campaign  to  combat  global  warming.  We  had  designated  it  ‘FLICK  OFF’,  
as a reminder to turn off electricity at every opportunity, including all standby buttons. A slight touch 
of irreverence always amuses  me – and I think people do remember the tongue -in-cheek approach. 
However, I was bemused to find that some worthy Canadian councillors decided that the phrase was 
rather  indecent  and  someone  should  tell  me  that  I  should  ‘flick  off’!  After three years of d ithering on the part of the US Department of Transportation, Virgin America 
finally got the go -ahead to fly on 19 May. It was a great relief, not just to me, but to many people 
whose future jobs at VA were at stake, and, particularly, to Fred and the team at VA, who had worked 
non-stop to do all that was required of them to appease the DOT, and the other US airlines who had 
blocked us for so long.  
I have always believed in healthy competition as a way of driving up standards and letting 
customers have the b est  possible  deal.  However,  we  weren’t  fully  out  of  the  woods.  Despite  all  the  
changes we had scrupulously made as and when requested, the DOT insisted that we had to replace 
Fred Reid as CEO within six months and to limit the influence of the Virgin Group  over  VA’s  
operations  even  further.  Since  we  had  already  distanced  ourselves  from  VA,  there  didn’t  seem  much  
more we could do – but we were willing to comply. However, VA asked for the decision over Fred to 
be reversed. He was, after all, an American and h e had previously been the president of Delta (one of 
the  airlines  that  had  been  opposing  Virgin  America).  It  didn’t  make  sense.  Nevertheless,  being  passed  
to fly was very welcome, and we started working hard on a mid -summer launch. VA currently offers 
flights between San Francisco International Airport and John F Kennedy International Airport in New 
York  as  well  as  services  to  San  Diego,  Las  Vegas,  Los  Angeles,  Boston,  Seattle  and  Washington’s  
Dulles International Airport. Within five years, VA hopes to add  other  cities  so  it’s  an  ambitious  roll -
out. 
Simultaneously, Virgin Atlantic shifted strategy to defer our order for the Airbus A380 – which 
was very behind schedule – for four years, from 2009 to 2013. We still have confidence in the jumbo, 
but, in keepin g with our safety and performance strategy, we want it to be in service elsewhere before 
finally committing ourselves. Instead, following our environmental lead, on 26 May, I signed a 
contract with Boeing chairman Jim McNerney to buy forty -three shining ne w Boeing 787 
Dreamliners, worth $8 billion. It was the biggest order Virgin Atlantic has ever made, and they are the 
first carbon -composite aircraft in commercial service. Looking back, to the Virgin Atlantic Global 
Flyer,  the  world’s  first  all -composite a ircraft, in which Steve Fossett flew around the world, I felt 
more than happy that we had paid for the Flyer to be built – to prove the point that all carbon -
composite  aircraft  could  fly  long  distances  at  high  altitudes  on  a  teacup  of  fuel  (just  joking  …).  But 
the press suddenly picked up a joke that was slipped into the hefty contract that Jim McNerney and I 
signed; in this case, the deal between Virgin Atlantic and Boeing included a clause pledging that Jim 
and I would each lose a stone in weight to help reduce our carbon footprints when flying.  
The  clause  reads:  ‘The  parties  hereby  agree  that  each  of  the  signatories  will  lose  at  least  one  stone  
in weight within the next four years in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 36lb on the 
delivery fl ight.’  Apparently,  our  legal  team  had  put  it  in  as  a  joke  to  see  if  we  would  read  the  small  
print, and when we missed it on early readings, nobody had thought to take it out.  
Tongue  in  cheek,  Virgin’s  communications  director,  Paul  Charles,  said:  ‘Clearly,   neither of them 
reads contracts properly before they sign them. We are doing our bit to tackle carbon emissions, but 
losing weight was an additional element thrown in for added effect. If you are carrying lighter people 
in the plane, you need even less fue l. Perhaps the Government should consider adopting it as a way to 
combat  obesity  and  climate  change  in  one  go.’  When asked by the press how much I weighed, I was honest and gave my correct weight at the 
time. But, as I pointed out, I was about to head to t he Arctic and had deliberately added thirty pounds 
as  a  fat  reserve.  I  don’t  know  what  Jim’s  excuse  was,  though!  
At the same time as I signed the Dreamliners contract, I also signed an agreement with Boeing 
and General Electric, who are the engine manufact urers, to work on a joint development of a biofuel 
for aviation, which to me represents a sensational prospect. People always said that biofuels could 
never  be  developed  for  aeroplane  engines.  We’ve  been  working  on  a  new  biofuel  for  general  use  
called ISO biobutanol, which may have some of the right characteristics to make a biofuel for 
aviation, and will continue with it. But – and this is top secret – we’re  also  working  on  developing  
another fuel that could be a stunning breakthrough. There is no doubt ab out it – I am hooked on 
science in a way I never thought possible. I also smile at the irony of being in partnership with Boeing. 
When I think of how I had telephoned them once out of the blue and naively asked if I could rent one 
of their jumbos, it makes  me realise that the future is a highly intriguing place to look back from.  
With the possibility of clean aviation fuel at the end of May, I offered £1 million to a group 
founded by former Concorde pilots and executives to help Concorde to fly again. I hav e always 
thought that Concorde was one of the most beautiful of all aeroplanes and it was a sad day when the 
last one flew on 24 October 2003. I was disappointed when my offer to buy each plane for £1 million 
was turned down by British Airways. It seemed l udicrous that a supersonic plane that had flown for 
thirty years should be consigned to mothballs.  
When Concorde was grounded I vowed that I would keep up the campaign to keep Concorde 
flying,  and  told  the  press,  ‘At  the  very  least  a  heritage  trust  should   be set up to keep Concorde in the 
UK  so  future  generations  can  see  it.  It  would  be  terrible  if  future  generations  could  never  see  it  fly.’  
It seemed to me that in turning me down BA was keeping our long rivalry going – a rivalry that 
continued to April 200 7, when, bizarrely, they censored me from the latest James Bond film. The 
Daily Telegraph  wrote:  ‘In  Soviet  Russia  anyone  who  fell  out  of  favour  with  the  ruling  elite  was  
airbrushed out of history. Now it appears that British Airways has adopted the same a pproach towards 
its corporate nemesis, Sir Richard Branson. The Virgin Atlantic chairman, who makes a brief cameo 
appearance in Casino Royale , the latest James Bond film, is somehow missing from the version shown 
on  British  Airways  flights.’  
We would never in a million years dream of censoring any of our in -flight films. Our philosophy 
is  that  we  expect  parents  to  guide  their  children.  Obviously,  we  don’t  show  porn,  but  we  do  show  adult  
or serious films. For instance, we are the only airline i n  the  world  to  show  Al  Gore’s   An Inconvenient 
Truth .  Will  telephoned  Paul  Charles,  the  head  of  communications  at  Virgin  Atlantic,  and  said,  ‘Look,  
if anybody phones you about this, remind them that in the Bond film, Die Another Day ,  there’s  a  big  
scene sho wing a BA plane in Miami with the BA logo all over it. Tell them we never censored that 
out.’  I  was  amused  that  BA  overreacted  like  that.  
Early  in  June,  I  returned  to  Kenya  to  welcome  Virgin  Atlantic’s  first  daily  flights  to  Nairobi,  
which will carry thous ands of passengers and export Kenyan agricultural produce, worth $100 million 
a year to Kenyan farmers. I also launched another step in the Peace Parks initiative, by contributing an 
‘elephant  highway’  to  allow  some  2,000  elephants  to  freely  move  on  their   traditional migratory routes 
to and from Mount Kenya. Their search for the mineral salts they need in their diet takes them through the hundreds of small farms that have mushroomed all over the skirts of this beautiful, snow -capped 
volcanic peak and farmer s have been shooting elephants to prevent them from trampling their crops. 
The Virgin Mount Kenya Elephant Corridor will stop conflict between farmers and these magnificent 
creatures, and allow them to survive.  
At  the  launch,  I  said,  ‘The  African  elephant   has roamed across the continent from South Africa to 
the Mediterranean coast but its population is under serious threat. We can create a vital lifeline for the 
entire  animal  and  human  population  in  the  region.’  
It was a very happy day. Not only did I get t o dance on the wing of the first Virgin Atlantic plane 
into Nairobi with some African dancers and a Kenyan air hostess in their colourful robes – well, 
Virgin’s  distinctive  red  cabin  staff  outfit   – but I was also made an elder by the Masai people in a very  
moving ceremony. Afterwards, with my 89 -year-old dad and Sam, I took to the skies in a hot -air 
balloon. It was the first time I had been in a balloon since my round -the-world attempt in 1998, when I 
splashed into the sea off Hawaii. It was amazing, to sai l high above the vast African landscape, 
following the route of the elephants towards Mount Kenya. At over 17,000 feet it is the second highest 
mountain in Africa and until recently – despite being almost on the Equator – it has always been 
covered in snow . The scenery and the experience could not have been more beautiful. Three 
generations of Branson men in a balloon – it was a moment to relish.  
It seems a huge step from Stone Age elephants and hot -air balloons to spaceships, but today the 
world is a dazzl ing place where you can go back in time and forward into the future. As I write this, 
Virgin Galactic is preparing to start its test flight programme, with Brian Binnie as the test pilot for the 
first 100 flights. We know the system is intrinsically safer than launching a rocket from the ground, 
but will be only able to prove that by actually flying it. The two most exciting aspects of the spaceship 
system are safety and its low environmental footprint. But ultimately I agree with Professor Hawking 
– that w e really need to be in space long term because ultimately humanity will have to find a second 
home somewhere in space. Simple physics tells us that one day we will be struck by an asteroid or that 
we could suffer from a catastrophic volcanic event, either of which would create a nuclear winter 
which our dense population may not survive.  
So  as  Professor  Hawking  said,  ‘Let’s  use  the  next  1,000  years  to  boldly  go  where  no  one  has  
gone  before.’  
It is with family and my social challenges in mind that I spend les s and less time promoting the Virgin 
brand through dangerous world -record  attempts;;  sitting  at  home,  writing  this,  I  think  it’s  unlikely  I  
will do another project on the scale of the round -the-world balloon flight.  
I spend much time travelling and so treas ure the moments the family are together. In many ways 
we are closest when we are all on Necker. It has developed from being the jewel that symbolised the 
feelings Joan and I have for each other into being a place where the whole family feel at home and at 
peace. We try to go for Easter, summer and Christmas holidays. With my parents, my sisters and their 
families, our closest friends, and quite a few people from all the different Virgin companies, it is like a 
melting pot where we all take stock of what is happening and get away from everything apart from the 
fax machine.  I’ve  taught  the  children  to  play  tennis  there,  and  to  swim,  snorkel  and  sail.  When  we’re  there  
we’re  there  for  each  other.  It’s  a  time  to  relax  and  reflect  on  what  we’re  all  doing,  because   we know 
that  when  we’re  back  in  London  it’s  back  to  work.  
My  favourite  time  of  day  there  is  the  early  evening.  By  then  it’s  midnight  in  London  and  it’s  
virtually impossible to speak to anyone in Europe. The fax and telephone are silent, and the sun sets 
quickly. In an hour or so the daylight changes from brilliant, almost white sunshine to dusk, with a 
deep orange blaze across the horizon. Sitting on the veranda, I can watch the last small flock of 
pelicans dive for fish and flap creakily away to roost. Wit hin minutes the sky turns a velvet midnight 
blue, and the first handful of stars are out. The sea in front of me becomes inky black and everything 
falls quiet.  
We  generally  have  supper  on  the  terrace.  Everyone  is  suntanned  and  happy.  It’s  great  to  be  
toget her, and I wonder what the future holds for all the kids here. I look over at Holly and Sam and 
realise  that  I  don’t  want  to  plan  their  lives  for  them.  I  just  want  them  to  be  happy.  I  know  that  other  
businessmen such as Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell ha d their children reading annual reports 
and financial accounts before breakfast, but I want none of that. Holly has been single -minded about 
her dream of being a doctor and she has taken her first big steps by qualifying and has a job in a big 
London hospi tal; while Sam has happily dipped his toe into the Virgin pool, by working for some 
months at Virgin Media in London, and is about to start working in Africa at our game parks – but the 
choice is entirely his whether or not he sees Virgin as a career for t he future. His love for music might 
compete with the family business! I wonder, too, what it will be like to not spend so much time on 
Necker. I am building a new, greener family home on Moskito and can visualise being as happy there 
as we have all been on  Necker. But, whatever the future holds, I am as excited and curious about it as I 
have always been. It is that curiosity and sense of adventure about the unknown with all its challenges 
that drives me. And with huge issues like AIDS and global warming and  the conflict issues, the 
challenges grow more urgent. But at moments like these, surrounded by my family in another Necker 
sunset, I am happy to forget about my notebook, with its constant burning list of things to do and 
people to call, and relax into be ing among people I love and care about.  
Even as we sit here, I know that one of our jumbos is heading from Heathrow to JFK, a route that 
was, until 2002, operated by Maiden Voyager , our original jumbo. She had been flying from London 
to New York since 1984  and had become the backbone of our airline and the linchpin of our success. 
Her retirement marked the end of an era, but also the beginning of a new one, with the arrival of our 
new A340 –600 in the summer of 2002. African Queen , one of our first A -340 Air buses, is humming 
through the night to Nairobi, our latest destination; and Lady in Red , our first Airbus, which was 
christened  by  Princess  Diana,  is  heading  overnight  towards  Hong  Kong.  Virgin  Atlantic’s  offices  at  
Crawley will be deserted save for the cl eaners, and the night shift will be drinking their second or third 
cup of coffee at Heathrow and Gatwick. There will be queues outside Heaven nightclub, and I wonder 
who is performing tonight and what the future holds for them. The Japanese and Paris Megas tores will 
be shut, but late -afternoon crowds will be leafing through the racks of CDs at the New York 
Megastore, before buying a can of Virgin Cola from a nearby vending machine. Meanwhile, in 
London our team at Virgin Books will be wondering why a certai n   ‘author’   is   late   with   his  
manuscript! And of course, in the Mojave desert, my dream for affordable space travel and a new era 
in human history will gradually be becoming a reality. Space really is virgin territory.  At the outset, each of those individual  ventures was a step into the unknown for the company – a 
bit  like  the  loss  of  one’s  virginity.  But,  unlike  really  losing  your  virginity,  in  whatever  world  you  make  
for  yourself,  you  can  keep  embracing  the  new  and  the  different  over  and  over  again.  That’s   what I 
have  always  wanted  for  Virgin  and,  whether  it’s  achieved  by  judgement  or  luck,  I  wouldn’t  have  it  
any other way.  
On 26 May 2007, Nelson Mandela arrived at Ulusaba for the first meeting of the Elders. He walked in 
amongst all these people waiting to greet him. How incredibly humbling it was to be in the presence 
of people who truly live with moral courage and who consistently put the betterment of humanity 
above anything else in their lives. When Madiba arrived, all the 150 members of staff at Ulusaba  and 
guests from the meeting formed lines up and down the path to welcome him – singing and dancing 
and showing their love for him. His goodness and moral leadership shone from the moment he stepped 
out of the car.  
He was fragile and tried to dance along w ith them, though his legs are worn out from having to 
kneel down, breaking stones during almost twenty -eight years of imprisonment on Robben Island – 
but the rest of his body still danced.  
Peter and I had been working towards getting the Elders launched fo r a long time, so the 
realisation that it was finally happening – all these extraordinary people gathered to greet Mandela and 
to be at the birth of the Elders – was truly one of the most emotional moments of my life. I was 
hopeful that history was being m ade at that very moment. It was all our wishes that the Elders become 
a powerful force for good in a very uncertain world and that they will go from strength to strength, 
sometimes to bring peace out of chaos; to calm dangerous flashpoints; and to help whe n plague, 
famine and disasters strike.  
As a collective humanity, it is unbelievable that we a re allowing thousands of people to die every 
day from preventable and treatable diseases, and allowing people to kill their brothers and sisters due 
to lack of natural resources and blindly waiting and doing almost nothing as the perils of climate 
change a re rapidly approaching.  
Yet we do have the power to change all of these things. Hopefully, this group of Elders, with 
Mandela and Graça at the helm, can bring some hope and wisdom back into the world to play a role in 
bringing us together to stop unnecessa ry human suffering and to celebrate the wonderful world that we 
are so privileged to be a part of.  
After a short introduction by Archbishop Tutu, Nelson Mandela opened the historic meeting by 
saying:  
In  today’s  world  many  of  the  problems  we  face  are  glob al in nature; these include climate 
change; pandemics such as AIDS, malaria and TB; and of course that entirely human -created 
affliction, violent conflict. Destructions we have to deal with. These problems are often tied 
down by political, economic or geog raphical constraints.  
As institutions of government grapple, often unequally, with challenges they face, the efforts 
of a small dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal 
interest in the outcome, can help resolve what o ften seem like intractable problems.  Gathered here today we have the makings of such a group. Using their experience, their 
moral courage, and their ability to rise above the parochial concerns of a nation, race and creed, 
they can help make our planet a m ore peaceful, healthy and equitable place to live.  
Let us call them Global Elders, not because of their age, but because of their individual and 
collective wisdom. This group derives its strength not from political, economic or military power, 
but from the  independence and integrity of those who are here. They do not have careers to build, 
elections to win, constituencies to please. They can talk to anyone they please and are free to 
follow paths they deem right, even if hugely unpopular.  
It is now several years since Richard and Peter came to me with their idea for the Elders. 
Since then I have watched the concept grow, gain structure and strength, and become a real 
viable and pragmatic initiative. I believe that with your experience and your energy and you r 
profound commitment to building a better world, the Elders can become a fiercely independent 
and robust force for good. Tackling complex and intractable issues, especially those that are not 
popular. However, I know that this group will not become arbitr ary and arrogant, and that it will 
seek advice from expert organisations and work co -operatively with them.  
What’s  more,  you  will  not  take  the  easy  short -term route, but support the long -term 
sustainable approaches, that address the root causes of the prob lems you tackle. Wherever 
possible you will work with local and indigenous knowledge, you will listen, bringing together 
antagonists and protagonists, working with anyone who is motivated to resolve a problem, and 
giving them support and the determination to do so. You can help foster and introduce innovative 
ideas and little -known solutions to connect to those who have real practical needs with those who 
have something to give.  
Through our friends in business we can mobilise up -to-date technology. And rais e not only 
awareness of forgotten issues, but also help and locate the resources to address them. But 
whatever techniques you use, I believe that in the end it is kindness and generous accommodation 
that are the catalysts for real change. And I expect that  if my friend the Archbishop has anything 
to do with it, you will insist on assuming the essential interdependence of all humankind. We call 
this the spirit of Ubuntu, that profound African sense that we are human only through the 
humanity of other human b eings. You should be conscious that you will often disagree with each 
other, and that you will have detractors.  
Who are these self -appointed saviours?, people will ask. Respond to this internal 
disagreement and outside critics with openness, in fact reach out to those detractors, convert them 
to this way of thinking. The Elders can become real role models, leading, guiding and supporting 
all sorts of initiatives. Both your own and those of many others. The Elders can speak freely and 
boldly. Working both pu blicly and behind the scenes, on whatever actions need to be taken. And 
remember, who needs your help the most? It is those that have the least, that suffer the most. It is 
they that are rarely heard. This group of Elders can help them and make sure they a re not ignored.  
I know that you will support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is 
conflict and inspire hope where there is despair. This initiative cannot have come at a more 
appropriate time, it will bring together an extraordinary  collection of people with the skills and 
resources to undertake what is now required. I am proud to be here, at this groundbreaking first meeting of the Global Elders. As I have said, I am trying to take my retirement seriously, and 
though I will not be a ble to participate in the really exciting part of the work, analysing problems, 
seeking solutions, searching out partners, I will be with you in spirit. I thank you.

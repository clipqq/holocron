Vote on the Top "Web 2.0" Startups --

April 2006A couple days ago I suggested to one of the organizers of the
Web 2.0 Conference that that they should
invite some little startups for free this year.
Ironically there were few startups last year, because the conference
cost so much that they couldn't afford it.He said they'd been thinking of doing that, and asked who I thought
they should invite.  As I tried to think of a list, I realized there
was a more "Web 2.0" way to do this: let everyone vote on it.So I asked the guys at reddit to set up a special reddit for this
purpose: web2.reddit.com.  Please submit and
vote for your favorite startups.  (You vote using the little arrows
next to each name.  You have to register to vote, but to register
you only have to choose a username and password; you don't have to
give your email address.)Note that this is a list of startups, not applications.  You'd nominate
37signals, not Basecamp specifically.This list has no official connection to the conference.
It's just an experiment to determine what the most admired
Web 2.0 startups are.

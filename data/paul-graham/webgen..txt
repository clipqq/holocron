Webgen --

This was our first logo.  I won't mention the name of
the designer, because he threw it together in a few
minutes and wasn't especially proud of it.The logo was designed to be centered, because centering
was the only formatting that existed then.  Netscape
had not yet introduced tables.The address was my apartment.  It was a 
calculated risk to leave off the apartment number.You don't see a lot of
startups based in Manhattan.  The address seems even more
anomalous if you know the neighborhood.

2005 Summer Founders --

(Click to see a full-size image.)Us, the 2005 summer founders, and Smartleaf co-founders Mark Nitzberg and Olin Shivers at the 30 foot table architect Kate Courteau designed for us.  The
design of the table presented challenges, because the floor of our building,
an old factory, is far from level.  Kate designed it in sections, held
together underneath by window latches.  Photo by Alex Lewin.

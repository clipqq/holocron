Probability --

Suppose 
that being over 7 feet tall indicates with 60% probability that someone
is a basketball player, and carrying a basketball indicates this with 72% 
probability.  If you see someone who
is over 7 feet tall and carrying a basketball, what is the probability
that they're a basketball player?If a and b are 
the probabilities associated with two independent pieces of evidence,
then combined they indicate a probability of:
       ab
-------------------
ab + (1 - a)(1 - b)

So in this case our answer is:
         (.60)(.72)
-------------------------------
(.60)(.72) + (1 - .60)(1 - .72)

which is .794.  There is a 79.4% chance that the person is a basketball player.When there are more than two pieces of evidence, the formula expands
as you might expect:
            abc           
---------------------------
abc + (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)

In the case of spam filtering, what we want to calculate is the probability
that the mail is a spam, and the individual pieces of evidence 
a, b, c, ... are the
spam probabilities associated with each of the words in the mail.For a good explanation of the background, see:http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath267.htm.

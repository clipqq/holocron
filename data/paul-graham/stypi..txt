Watch Me Make Mistakes --

November 2011Stypi is a new startup we 
funded that's continuing where Etherpad
left off.  Like Etherpad, Stypi can replay your edits.  I asked the
founders to make something special for me: a version of playback
that shows text that will ultimately be deleted in yellow.Startups in 13 SentencesWhat struck me most is the way writing seems for me to be a 
stick-slip phenomenon.  Initially I fumble about and keep rewriting the same
sentence over and over.  Then I get rolling and write a sentence or two
that make it almost intact into the final version, and then I get stuck again.
Watching
these parts is like watching a mouse find its way through a maze.There are several different types of things that get deleted.  There
are false starts, which get deleted immediately.  There are things
I get wrong the first time but don't realize it.  Those I go back
and rewrite later. And there are awkward or unnecessary words and
sentences, most of which I catch in successive passes near the end.
It's interesting how often the last sentence of a paragraph can
simply be deleted.

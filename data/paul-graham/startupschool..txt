Startup School --


This March 2005 plan for a startup school morphed into 
Y Combinator,
which then organized a startup
school much like this.
A friend of mine who works for an investment bank is considering
organizing a one-day conference for tech types who think
they might want to start a startup one day, and want to learn more about
how the whole thing works.  It would probably be possible to 
round up a good selection of founders and VCs to explain 
what to do, and what not to do.The conference would probably be free, or nearly so,
and would probably take place in Boston.

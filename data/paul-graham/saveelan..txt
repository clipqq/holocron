Save Bistro Elan --

The venerable Bistro Elan, one of the best-loved restaurants in
Silicon Valley, is shutting down on July 2 because their landlord
raised their rent so much they can no longer afford it.(They're going to start serving dinner at their tiny lunch place
on Birch St.  But it's so much smaller they're going to have to
fire half the people.  It won't be the same.)There are probably quite a few regulars at Bistro Elan who could buy the building and become their new landlord.  If someone did they 
could save both this Palo 
Alto institution, and the jobs of all the people who will otherwise
lose them.When the city chopped down the oak 
trees on California Ave, we didn't
have enough warning to stop them.  This disaster the community can
prevent, if it wants to.

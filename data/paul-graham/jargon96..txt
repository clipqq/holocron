Jargon File Entry --


(This entry from the Jargon File, which later became the 
Hackers' Dictionary, originally dates from the mid-80s.
The first versions of the Jargon File didn't have an entry
for Lisp, because it was assumed that every hacker knew what
it was.):LISP: /n./  [from `LISt Processing language', but mythically
   from `Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses'] AI's mother
   tongue, a language based on the ideas of (a) variable-length lists
   and trees as fundamental data types, and (b) the interpretation of
   code as data and vice-versa.  Invented by John McCarthy at MIT in
   the late 1950s, it is actually older than any other  still
   in use except FORTRAN.  Accordingly, it has undergone considerable
   adaptive radiation over the years; modern variants are quite
   different in detail from the original LISP 1.5.  The dominant HLL
   among hackers until the early 1980s, LISP now shares the throne
   with .  See .All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return
   values; this, together with the high memory utilization of LISPs,
   gave rise to Alan Perlis's famous quip (itself a take on an Oscar
   Wilde quote) that "LISP programmers know the value of everything
   and the cost of nothing".One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example
   that most newer languages, such as  and , are full
   of unnecessary s.  When the  has already
   been done once, there is no justification for  in newer
   languages.

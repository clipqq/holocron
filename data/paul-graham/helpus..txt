Help Us --


We often get mail saying: you should take a look at 
Language X; it has some really cool features.We're ready to embrace
(and extend) any great new ideas that are out there, but there
are just too many languages for us to learn them all.That's where you can help.  If some other language has
a core language feature that impresses you, make a post
describing it on the Arc
Forum, along with, if applicable, the presumably 
kludgier code you'd have to write in Arc to do the same thing.

Traffic --

This graph shows traffic from Jan 2001 to Aug 2005.
The big spikes mostly represent slashdottage.The biggest spike is What You'll
Wish You'd Known.
The most popular essays over the
long term are Great Hackers and 
How to Start a Startup.This graph was generated by Yahoo Store.  The software 
that generates them was
written by Trevor Blackwell,
who later became famous as the mad inventor who built his 
own
Segway.  I wish now we'd added a log scale option.

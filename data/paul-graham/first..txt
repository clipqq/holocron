Was Viaweb First? --

As far as 
we knew, Viaweb was the first web-based application, 
but I worry that there were others we didn't know
about.  So please tell me if you know of any earlier.It depends what counts as an application, of course.  What I mean
by an application is a web site that is not merely an interface
to a database, but something like a desktop application, where
the user actually builds things on the server.  
That is, something with the
equivalent of file-&gt;new.Robert Morris and I demoed the first version of Viaweb to investors
in August 1995.  At the time, 
as far as we knew, it was a new 
kind of software.  But I don't want to be saying something that isn't
true, so if anyone knows of any web-based applications before that,
please drop me a line.

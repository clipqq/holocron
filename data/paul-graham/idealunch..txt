Let's Do Lunch --

November 2010Note: This item was originally part of the silent auction, but
it has now been switched to the live auction.  The live auction 
starts at 8 pm but if you want to bid you should show up by 7
to buy a ticket.One of the items at this year's Harvest
Moon Auction for the Bing Nursery School Scholarship Fund is
lunch with me to talk about your startup or startup idea.  I'll
take the winner to lunch somewhere good and we can either talk about
what you plan to work on, or if you aren't sure yet, figure out an
idea that you'd be well-suited to work on.  It's effectively the
first two office hour sessions of Y Combinator, but with no dilution
and better food.The item in question is #406.  The auction is on the evening of
November 13 at the Stanford Alumni Center, 
326 Galvez
Street Stanford, California.  
The live auction starts at 8 pm, but you have to buy a $20 ticket
to participate, and the Bing folks recommend you get there by 7
at the latest to buy your ticket.Sorry, there's no way to bid remotely.  You have to show up in person.

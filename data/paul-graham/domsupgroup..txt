Domain Support Group / iSupportNet --

I was recently cold-called (on my cell phone)
by a company called the Domain Support Group,
which the woman on the phone said was a "transfer notification agent."
I have been dealing with domain names for many years and I had never
heard of "a transfer notification agent." I was suspicious, and it turns out
I was right to be.If you look at the front page of the Domain Support Group, it looks as if
they are some kind of semi official organization.  The page has
just the kind of ugly look it would have if it were administered by
ICANN, and it is sprinkled with quotes about ICANN's mission.  
Strangely, however, the page also had ads on it.  I poked around 
further in the site, and got still more suspicious.Meanwhile the woman on the phone transferred me 
to her supervisor.  When I told him I had had domain names for many
years and never had to deal with a "transfer notification agent," he
just hung up. Apparently I am not the kind of prospect the Domain
Support Group is looking for.So then I went to Google and searched for "domain support group scam"
and what do you know, I got search results:http://www.niner.net/docs/dsg.shtmlhttp://www.bankersonline.com/technology/techalert_040902.htmlApparently the business of the Domain Support Group is to trick people into registering 
.us, .info, and .biz
domain names.  I hope this page adds to the search results about them.This group also appears to operate under the name Internet Support
Network, or iSupportNet.(If this page helped you, you can help ensure it comes
up near the top of Google search results by making a link to it on your own site.)

Why it's hard to meet --

In California, I work most days at my house up in the Santa Cruz 
mountains. The round trip to the valley is an hour (assuming zero 
traffic).  So meeting with someone is never just a matter of "grabbing 
coffee;" it consumes a big chunk of an afternoon.  And an interruption 
on that scale means I will get significantly less programming or writing
done that day.I solve the problem of meeting with YC founders who need to talk 
to me by designating blocks of time as office hours at YC several 
times a week.  But this wouldn't work well for meeting other people. 
Among other things, there's not much privacy; YC is effectively one giant
room.I'm still willing to meet in person with people who feel they need 
to talk to me about something very important.  But if it's possible to 
talk via phone or email, that would be a lot easier for me.

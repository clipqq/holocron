PUBLISHERS' NOTE 
In 1959 the UNESCO published a compilation of Gandh ij’s writings, viz. All Men 
Are Brothers, with a view to familiarizing the peop le of the world with his life, 
work and mission, hoping that it would help mankind  in its troubled condition 
of our age. The writings were selected and compiled  in a way that would 
introduce the reader to Gandhiji’s writings, work, personality and way of life, 
as the common man cannot have a direct approach to the vast mass of 
Gandhiji’s writings. This compilation was published  in French and Spanish also. 
Navajivan Trust has published the Indian Edition of  UNESCO’s English 
compilation as well as its Hindi and Gujarati trans lations. All the three versions 
have been well received and there have been three s uccessive editions of all of 
them. 
This little booklet, Gandhi’s Life in His Own Words , comprises of the first 
chapter of the UNESCO’s compilation, viz. All Men A re Brothers. Gandhiji’s life 
and thoughts from his birth to his death on January  30, 1948, i. e. up to twenty 
hours before his death, have been encompassed in it . This very brief but 
comprehensive compilation has been made and edited by Shri Krishna 
Kripalani, Chairman of the National Book Trust. We are thankful to him for his 
permission to publish this chapter as a separate bo oklet.  
Of late, the common people, especially the younger generation, have been 
eager to know about Gandhiji’s life. This booklet i s made available at a price 
that barely covers its production cost in order to satisfy the people’s need. We 
hope that this compilation will evoke suitable appr eciation among its readers. 
Its Gujarati and Hindi versions have also been brou ght out.

It is not my purpose to attempt a real autobiograph y. I simply want to tell the 
story of my numerous experiments with truth, and as  my life consists of nothing 
but those experiments; it is true that the story wi ll take the shape of an 
autobiography. But I shall not mind, if every page of it speaks only of my 
experiments.  AMG, 4  
 
My experiments in the political field are now known , not only to India, but to a 
certain extent to the ‘civilized’ world. For me, th ey have not much value; and 
the title of ‘Mahatma’ that they have won for me ha s, therefore, even less. 
Often the title has deeply pained me; and there is not a moment I can recall 
when it may be said to have tickled me. But I shoul d certainly like to narrate 
my experiments in the spiritual field which are kno wn only to myself, and from 
which I have derived such power as I possess for wo rking in the political field. If 
the experiments are really spiritual, then there ca n be no room for self-praise. 
They can only add to my humility. The more I reflec t and look back on the 
past, the more vividly do I feel my limitations.   AMG. 4  
 
What I want to achieve-what I have been striving an d pining to achieve these 
thirty years-is-self-realization, to see God face t o face, to attain Moksha. I live 
and move and have my being in pursuit of this goal.  All that I do by way of 
speaking and writing, and all my ventures in the po litical field, are directed to 
this same end. But as I have all along believed tha t what is possible for one is 
possible for all, my experiments have not been cond ucted in the closet, but in 
the open; and I do not think that this fact detract s from their spiritual value. 
There are some things which are known only to onese lf and one’s Maker. These 
are clearly incommunicable. The experiments I am ab out to relate are not 
such. But they are spiritual, or rather moral; for the essence of religion is 
morality. AMG. 4-5

www.mkgandhi.org Page 4  Far be it from me to claim any degree of perfection  for these experiments. I 
claim for them nothing more than does a scientist w ho, though he conducts his 
experiments with the utmost accuracy, forethought a nd minuteness, never 
claims any finality about his conclusions, but keep s an open mind regarding 
them. I have gone through deep self-introspection, searched myself through 
and through, and examined and analysed every psycho logical situation. Yet I 
am far from claiming any finality or infallibility about my conclusions. One 
claim I do indeed make and it is this. For me they appear to be absolutely 
correct, and seem for the time being to be final. F or if they were not, I should 
base no action on them. But at every step I have ca rried out the process of 
acceptance or rejection and acted accordingly.  AMG, 5  
 
My life is one indivisible whole, and all my activi ties run into one another, and 
they all have their rise in my insatiable love of m ankind.  SB, 45  
 
The Gandhis belong to the Bania caste and seem to h ave been originally 
grocers. But for three generations, from my grandfa ther, they have been prime 
ministers in several Kathiawad States….My grandfath er must have been a man 
of principle. State intrigues compelled him to leav e Porbander, where he was 
Diwan, and to seek refuge in Junagadh. There he sal uted the Nawab with the 
left hand. Someone, noticing the apparent discourte sy; asked for an 
explanation, which was given thus: ‘The right hand is already pledged to 
Porbander’.  AMG, 11  
 
My father was a lover of his clan, truthful, brave and generous, but short-
tempered. To a certain extent he might have been ev en given to carnal 
pleasures. For he married for the fourth time when he was over forty. But he 
was incorruptible and had earned a name for strict impartiality in his family as 
well as outside.  AMG, 12  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 5  The outstanding impression my mother has left on my  memory is that of 
saintliness. She was deeply religious. She would no t think of taking her meals 
without her daily prayers….She would take the harde st vows and keep them 
without flinching. Illness was no excuse for relaxi ng them.  AMG, 12-13  
 
Of these parents I was born at Porbandar….I passed my childhood in Porbandar. 
I recollect having been put to school. It was with some difficulty that I got 
through the multiplication tables. The fact that I recollect nothing more of 
those days than having learnt, in company with othe r boys, to call our teacher 
all kinds of names, would strongly suggest that my intellect must have been 
sluggish, and my memory raw. AMG, 14  
 
I used to be very shy and avoided all company. My b ooks and my lessons were 
my sole companions. To be at school at the stroke o f the hour and to run back 
home as soon as the school closed – that was my dai ly habit. I literally ran 
back, because I could not bear to talk to anybody. I was even afraid lest any 
one should poke fun at me.  AMG, 15  
 
There is an incident which occurred at the examinat ion during my first year at 
the high school and which is worth recording. Mr. G iles,the Educational 
Inspector, had come on a visit of inspection. He ha d set us five words to write 
as a spelling exercise. One of the words was ‘kettl e’. I had mis-spelt it. The 
teacher tried to prompt me with the point of his bo ot, but I would not be 
prompted. It was beyond me to see that he wanted me  to copy the spelling 
from my neighbour’s slate, for I had thought that t he teacher was there to 
supervise us against copying. The result was that a ll the boys, except myself, 
were found to have spelt every word correctly. Only  I had been stupid. The 
teacher tried later to bring this stupidity home to  me, but without effect. I 
never could learn the art of ‘copying’.  AMG, 15-16  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 6  It is my painful duty to have to record here my mar riage at the age of thirteen. 
As I see the youngsters of the same age about me wh o are under my care, and 
think of my own marriage, I am inclined to pity mys elf and to congratulate 
them on having escaped my lot. I can see no moral a rgument in support of such 
a preposterously early marriage.  AMG, 18  
 
I do not think it (marriage) meant to me anything m ore than the prospect of 
good clothes to wear, drum beating, marriage proces sions, rich dinners and a 
strange girl to play with. The carnal desire came l ater. AMG, 19  
 
And oh! that first night. Two innocent children all  unwittingly hurled 
themselves into the ocean of life. My brother’s wif e had thoroughly coached 
me about my behaviour on the first night. I do not know who had coached my 
wife. I have never asked her about it, nor am I inc lined to do so now. The 
reader may be sure that we were too nervous to face  each other. We were 
certainly too shy. How was I to talk to her, and wh at was I to say? The coaching 
could not carry me far. But no coaching is really n ecessary in such 
matters….We gradually began to know ach other, and to speak freely together. 
We were the same age. But I took no time in assumin g the authority of a 
husband.  AMG, 21  
 
I must say I was passionately fond of her. Even at school I used to think of her, 
and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent mee ting was ever haunting me. 
Separation was unbearable. I used to keep her awake  till late in the night with 
my idle talk. If with this devouring passion there had not been in me a burning 
attachment to duty, I should either have fallen a p rey to disease and 
premature death, or have sunk into a burdensome exi stence. But the appointed 
tasks had to be gone through every morning, and lyi ng to anyone was out of the 
question. It was this last thing that saved me from  many a pitfall. AMG, 23-24  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 7  I had not any high regard for my ability. I used to  be astonished whenever I won 
prizes and scholarships. But I very jealously guard ed my character. The least 
little blemish drew tears from my eyes. When I meri ted, or seemed to the 
teacher to merit, a rebuke, it was unbearable for m e. I remember having once 
received corporal punishment. I did not so much min d the punishment, as the 
fact that it was considered my desert. I wept piteo usly.  AMG, 26-27  
 
Amongst my few friends at the high school I had, at  different times, two who 
might be called intimate. One of these friendships… I regard as a tragedy in my 
life. It lasted long. I formed it in the spirit of a reformer.  AMG, 31  
 
I have seen since that I had calculated wrongly. A reformer cannot afford to 
have close intimacy with him whom he seeks to refor m. True friendship is an 
identity of souls rarely to be found in this world.  Only between like natures can 
friendship be altogether worthy and enduring. Frien ds react on one another. 
Hence in friendship there is very little scope for reform. I am of opinion that all 
exclusive intimacies are to be avoided; for man tak es in vice far more readily 
than virtue. And he who would be friends with God m ust remain alone, or make 
the whole world his friend. I may be wrong, but my effort to cultivate an 
intimate friendship proved a failure.  AMG, 31-32  
 
This friend’s exploits cast a spell over me. He cou ld run long distances and 
extraordinarily fast. He was an adept in high and l ong jumping. He could put up 
with any amount of corporal punishment. He would of ten display his exploits to 
me and, as one is always dazzled when he sees in ot hers the qualities that he 
lacks himself, I was dazzled by this friend’s explo its. This was followed by a 
strong desire to be like him. I could hardly jump o r run. Why should not I also 
be as strong as he?  AMG, 32-33  
 
I was a coward. I used to be haunted by the fear of  thieves, ghosts and 
serpents. I did not dare to stir out of doors at ni ght. Darkness was a terror to Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 8  me. It was almost impossible for me to sleep in the  dark, as I would imagine 
ghosts coming from one direction, thieves from anot her and serpents from a 
third. I could not therefore bear to sleep without a light in the room.  AMG, 33  
 
My friend knew all these weaknesses of mine. He wou ld tell me that he could 
hold in his hand live serpents, could defy thieves and did not believe in ghosts. 
And all this was, of course, the result of eating m eat.  AMG, 33  
 
All this had its due effect on me….It began to grow  on me that meat-eating was 
good, that it would make me strong and daring, and that, if the whole country 
took to meat-eating, the English could be overcome.  AMG, 33  
 
Whenever I had occasion to indulge in these surrept itious feasts, dinner at 
home was out of the question. My mother would natur ally ask me to come and 
take my food and want to know the reason why I did not wish to eat. I would 
say to her ‘I have no appetite today; there is some thing wrong with my 
digestion.’ It was not without compunction that I d evised these pretexts. I 
knew I was lying, and lying to my mother. I also kn ew that if my mother and 
father came to know of my having become a meat-eate r, they would be deeply 
shocked. This knowledge was gnawing at my heart. 
Therefore I said to myself: Though it is essential to eat meat, and also essential 
to take up food ‘reform’ in the country, yet deceiv ing and lying to one’s father 
and mother is worse than not eating meat. In their lifetime, therefore, meat-
eating must be out of the question. When they are n o more and I have found 
my freedom, I will eat meat openly, but until that moment arrives I will abstain 
from it. 
This decision I communicated to my friend, and I ha ve never since gone back to 
meat.    AMG, 36  
 
My friend once took me to a brothel. He sent me in with the necessary 
instructions. It was all pre-arranged. The bill had  already been paid. I went Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 9  into the jaws of sin, but God in His infinite mercy  protected me against myself. 
I was almost struck blind and dumb in this den of v ice. I sat near the woman on 
her bed, but I was tongue-tied. She naturally lost patience with me, and 
showed me the door, with abuses and insults. I then  felt as though my manhood 
had been injured, and wished to sink into the groun d for shame. But I have 
ever since given thanks to God for having saved me.  I can recall four more 
similar incidents in my life, and in most of them m y good fortune, rather than 
any effort on my part, saved me. From a strictly et hical point of view, all these 
occasions must be regarded as moral lapses; for the  carnal desire was there, 
and it was as good as the act. But from the ordinar y point of view, a man who 
is saved from physically committing sin is regarded  as saved. And I was saved 
only in that sense.    AMG, 37  
 
As we know that man often succumbs to temptation, h owever much he may 
resist it, we also know that Providence often inter cedes and saves him in spite 
of himself. How all this happens – how far a man is  free and how far a creature 
of circumstances – how far free-will comes into pla y and where fate enters on 
the scene – all this is a mystery and will remain a  mystery.  AMG, 37  
 
One of the reasons of my differences with my wife w as undoubtedly the 
company of this friend. I was both a devoted and a jealous husband, and this 
friend fanned the flame of my suspicions about my w ife. I never could doubt 
his veracity. And I have never forgiven myself the violence of which I have been 
guilty in often having pained my wife by acting on his information. Perhaps only 
a Hindu wife could tolerate these hardships, and th at is why I have regarded 
woman as an incarnation of tolerance. AMG, 38  
 
The canker of suspicion was rooted out only when I understood ahimsa in all its 
bearings. I saw then the glory of brahmacharya and realized that the wife is not 
the husband’s bondslave, but his companion and his helpmate, and an equal 
partner in all his joys and sorrows – as free as th e husband to choose her own Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 10  path. Whenever I think of those dark days of doubts  and suspicions, I am filled 
with loathing of my folly and my lustful cruelty, a nd I deplore my blind 
devotion to my friend.  AMG, 38  
 
From my sixth or seventh year up to my sixteenth I was at school, being taught 
all sorts of things except religion. I may say that  I failed to get from the 
teachers what they could have given me without any effort on their part. And 
yet I kept on picking up things here and there from  my surroundings. The term 
‘religion’ I am using in its broadest sense, meanin g thereby self-realization or 
knowledge of self.  AMG, 47  
 
But one thing took deep root in me – the conviction  that morality is the basis of 
things, and that truth is the substance of all mora lity. Truth became my sole 
objective. It began to grow in magnitude every day,  and my definition of it also 
has been ever widening.  AMG, 50-51  
 
I regard untouchability as the greatest blot on Hin duism. This idea was not 
brought home to me by my bitter experiences during the South African 
struggle. It is not due to the fact that I was once  an agnostic. It is equally 
wrong to think that I have taken my views from my s tudy of Christian religious 
literature. These views date as far back as the tim e when I was neither 
enamoured of, nor was acquainted with, the Bible or  the followers of the Bible. 
I was hardly yet twelve when this idea had dawned o n me. A scavenger named 
Uka, an untouchable, used to attend our house for c leaning latrines. Often I 
would ask my mother why it was wrong to touch him, why I was forbidden to 
touch him. If I accidently touched Uka, I was asked  to perform the ablutions, 
and though I naturally obeyed, it was not without s milingly protesting that 
untouchability was not sanctioned by religion, that  it was impossible that it 
should be so. I was a very dutiful and obedient chi ld and so far as it was 
consistent with respect for parents, I often had tu ssles with them on this Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 11  matter. I told my mother that she was entirely wron g in considering physical 
contact with Uka as sinful.  MT, II, 47-48  
 
I passed the matriculation examination in 1887.  AMG, 52  
 
My elders wanted me to pursue my studies at college  after the matriculation. 
There was a college in Bhavnagar as well as in Bomb ay, and as the former was 
cheaper, I decided to go there and join the Samalda s College. I went, but 
found myself entirely at sea. Everything was diffic ult. I could not follow, let 
alone taking interest in, the professors’ lectures.  It was no fault of theirs. The 
professors in that college were regarded as first-r ate. But I was so raw. At the 
end of the first term, I returned home. AMG, 52  
 
A shrewd and learned Brahmin, an old friend and adv iser of the 
family…happened to visit us during my vacation. In conversation with my 
mother and elder brother, he inquired about my stud ies. Learning that I was at 
Samaldas College, he said: ‘The times are changed…. I would far rather than 
you sent him to England. My son Kevalram says it is  very easy to become a 
barrister. In three years’ time he will return. Als o expenses will not exceed 
four to five thousand rupees. Think of that barrist er who has just come back 
from England. How stylishly he lives! He could get the diwanship for the asking. 
I would strongly advise you to send Mohandas to Eng land this very 
year.’ AMG, 52-53  
 
My mother was sorely perplexed….someone had told he r that young men got 
lost in England. Someone else had said that they to ok to meat; and yet 
another; that they could not live there without liq uor. ‘How about all this?’ she 
asked me. I said: ‘Will you not trust me? I shall n ot lie to you. I swear that I 
shall not touch any of those things. If there were any such danger, would 
Joshiji let me go?’…I vowed not to touch wine, woma n, and meat. This done, 
my mother gave her permission.  AMG, 54  Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 12   
Before the intention of coming to London for the sa ke of study was actually 
formed, I had a secret design in my mind of coming here to satisfy my curiosity 
of knowing what London was.  CWMG, 1,3  
 
At the age of eighteen I went to England….Everythin g was strange – the people, 
their ways, and even their dwellings. I was a compl ete novice in the matter of 
English etiquette and continually had to be on my g uard. There was the 
additional inconvenience of the vegetarian vow. Eve n the dishes that I could 
eat were tasteless and insipid. I thus found myself  between Scylla and 
Charybdis. England I could not bear, but to return to India was not to be 
thought of. Now that I had come, I must finish the three years, said the inner 
voice.    AMG, 63  
 
The landlady was at a loss to know what to prepare for me….The friend 1 
continually reasoned with me to eat meat, but I alw ays pleaded my vow and 
then remained silent….One day the friend began to r ead to me Bentham’s 
Theory of Utility. I was at my wits’ end. The langu age was too difficult for me 
to understand. He began to expound it. I said: ‘Pra y excuse me. These abstruse 
things are beyond me. I admit it is necessary to ea t meat. But I cannot break 
my vow. I cannot argue about it.’   AMG, 64-65  
 
I would trot ten or twelve miles each day, go into a cheap restaurant and eat 
my fill of bread, but would never be satisfied. Dur ing these wanderings I once 
hit on a vegetarian restaurant in Farringdon Street . The sight of it filled me 
with the same joy that a child feels on getting a t hing after its own heart. 
Before I entered I noticed books for sale exhibited  under a glass window near 
the door. I saw among them Salt’s Plea for Vegetari anism. This I purchased for 
a shilling and went straight to the dining room. Th is was my first hearty meal 
since my arrival in England. God had come to my aid . Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 13  I read Salt’s book from cover to cover and was very  much impressed by it. From 
the date of reading this book, I may claim to have become a vegetarian by 
choice. I blessed the day on which I had taken the vow before my mother. I had 
all along abstained from meat in the interests of t ruth and of the vow I had 
taken, but had wished at the same time that every I ndian should be a meat-
eater, and had looked forward to being one myself f reely and openly some day, 
and to enlisting others in the cause. The choice wa s now made in favour of 
vegetarianism, the spread of which henceforth becam e my mission.  
AMG, 66-67  
 
A convert’s enthusiasm for his new religion is grea ter than that of a person who 
is born in it. Vegetarianism was then a new cult in  England, and likewise for 
me, because, as we have seen, I had gone there a co nvinced meat-eater, and 
was intellectually converted to vegetarianism later . Full of the neophyte’s zeal 
for vegetarianism, I decided to start a vegetarian club in my locality, 
Bayswater. I invited Sir Edwin Arnold, who lived th ere, to be vice-president. 
Dr.Oldfield who was editor of The Vegetarian became  president. I myself 
became the secretary.   AMG, 79-80  
 
I was elected to the Executive Committee of the Veg etarian Society, and made 
it a point to attend every one of its meetings, but  I always felt tongue-
tied….Not that I never felt tempted to speak. But I  was at a loss to know how 
to express myself….This shyness I retained througho ut my stay in England. Even 
when I paid a social call the presence of half a do zen or more people would 
strike me dumb.   AMG, 81-82  
 
I must say that, beyond occasionally exposing me to  laughter, my constitutional 
shyness has been no disadvantage whatever. In fact I can see that, on the 
contrary, it has been all to my advantage. My hesit ancy in speech, which was 
once an annoyance, is now a pleasure. Its greatest benefit has been that it has 
taught me the economy of words.   AMG, 84  Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 14   
There was a great exhibition at Paris in 1890. I ha d read about its elaborate 
preparation, and I also had a keen desire to see Pa ris. So I thought I had better 
combine two things in one and go there at this junc ture. A particular attraction 
of the exhibition was the Eiffel Tower, constructed  entirely of iron, and nearly 
1,000 feet high. There were of course many other th ings of interest, but the 
tower was the chief one, inasmuch as it had been su pposed till then that a 
structure of that height could not safely stand.  AMG, 101  
 
I remember nothing of the exhibition excepting its magnitude and variety. I 
have fair recollection of the Eiffel Tower as I asc ended it twice of thrice. There 
was a restaurant on the first platform, and just fo r the satisfaction of being 
able to say that I had had my lunch at a great heig ht, I threw away seven 
shillings on it. 
The ancient churches of Paris are still in my memor y. Their grandeur and their 
peacefulness are unforgettable. The wonderful const ruction of Notre Dame and 
the elaborate decoration of the interior with its b eautiful sculptures cannot be 
forgotten. I felt then that those who expended mill ions on such divine 
cathedrals could not but have the love of God in th eir hearts. AMG, 101  
 
I must say a word about the Eiffel Tower. I do not know what purpose it serves 
today. But I then heard it greatly disparaged as we ll as praised. I remember 
that Tolstoy was the chief among those who disparag ed it. He said that the 
Eiffel Tower was a monument of man’s folly, not of his wisdom. Tobacco, he 
argued, was the worst of all intoxicants, inasmuch as a man addicted to it was 
tempted to commit crimes which a drunkard never dar ed to do; liquor made a 
man mad, but tobacco clouded his intellect and made  him build castles in the 
air. The Eiffel Tower was one of the creations of a  man under such influence. 
There is no art about the Eiffel Tower. In no way c an it be said to have 
contributed to the real beauty of the exhibition. M en flocked to see it and 
ascended it as it was a novelty and of unique dimen sions. It was the toy of the Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 15  exhibition. So long as we are children we are attra cted by toys, and the tower 
was a good demonstration of the fact that we are al l children attracted by 
trinkets. That may be claimed to be the purpose ser ved by the Eiffel 
Tower. AMG, 102  
 
I passed my examinations, was called to the Bar on the tenth of June 1891, and 
enrolled in the High Court on the eleventh. On the twelfth I sailed for 
home. AMG, 105  
 
My elder brother had built high hopes on me. The de sire for wealth and name 
and fame was great in him. He had a big heart, gene rous to a fault. This, 
combined with his simple nature, had attracted to h im many friends, and 
through them he expected to get me briefs. He had a lso assumed that I should 
have a swinging practice and had, in that expectati on, allowed the household 
expenses to become top-heavy. He had also left no s tone unturned in preparing 
the field for my practice. AMG, 115  
 
But it was impossible for me to get along in Bombay  for more than four or five 
months, there being no income to square with the ev er-increasing expenditure. 
This was how I began life. I found the barrister’s profession a bad job – much 
show and little knowledge. I felt a crushing sense of my responsibility.  
AMG, 118  
 
Disappointed, I left Bombay and went to Rajkot wher e I set up my own office. 
Here I got along moderately well. Drafting applicat ions and memorials brought 
me in on an average Rs.300 a month. AMG, 123  
 
In the meantime a Meman firm from Porbandar wrote t o my brother making the 
following offer: ‘We have business in South Africa.  Ours is a big firm, and we 
have a big case there in the court, our claim being  £40,000. It has been going 
on for a long time. We have engaged the services of  the best vakils and Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 16  barristers. If you sent your brother there, he woul d be useful to us and also to 
himself. He would be able to instruct our counsel b etter than ourselves. And he 
would have the advantage of seeing a new part of th e world, and of making 
new acquaintances’. AMG, 128  
 
This was hardly going there as a barrister. It was going as a servant of the firm. 
But I wanted somehow to leave India. There was also  the tempting opportunity 
of seeing a new country, and of having new experien ce. Also I could send £ 105 
to my brother and help in the expenses of the house hold. I closed with the 
offer without any higgling, and got ready to go to South Africa. AMG, 129  
 
When starting for South Africa I did not feel the w rench of separation which I 
had experienced when leaving for England. My mother  was now no more. I had 
gained some knowledge of the world, and of travel a broad, and going from 
Rajkot to Bombay was no unusual affair. 
This time I only felt the pang of parting with my w ife. Another baby had been 
born to us since my return from England. Our love c ould not yet be called free 
from lust, but it was getting gradually purer. Sinc e my return from Europe, we 
had lived very little together; and as I had now be come her teacher, however 
indifferent, and helped her to make certain reforms  we both felt the necessity 
of being more together, if only to continue the ref orms. But the attraction of 
South Africa rendered the separation bearable. AMG, 130  
 
The port of Natal is Durban also known as Port Nata l. Abdulla Sheth was there 
to receive me. As the ship arrived at the quay and I watched the people coming 
on board to meet their friends, I observed that the  Indians were not held in 
much respect. I could not fail to notice a sort of snobbishness about the 
manner in which those who knew Abdulla Sheth behave d towards him, and it 
stung me. Abdulla Sheth had got used to it. Those w ho looked at me did so with 
a certain amount of curiosity. My dress marked me o ut from other Indians. I 
had a frock-coat and a turban. AMG, 134  Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 17   
On the second or third day of my arrival, he took m e to see the Durban court. 
There he introduced me to several people and seated  me next to his attorney. 
The magistrate kept staring at me and finally asked  me to take off my turban. 
This I refused to do and left the court. AMG, 135  
 
On the seventh or eighth day after my arrival, I le ft Durban (for Pretoria). A 
first class seat was booked for me….The train reach ed Maritzburg, the capital 
of Natal, at about 9 p.m. Beddings used to be provi ded at this station. A 
railway servant came and asked me if I wanted one. ‘No’, said I, ‘I have one 
with me.’ He went away. But a passenger came next, and looked me up and 
down. He saw that I was a ‘coloured’ man. This dist urbed him. Out he went 
and came in again with one or two officials. They a ll kept quiet, when another 
official came to me and said, ‘Come along, you must  go to the van 
compartment.’ 
‘But I have a first class ticket,’ said I. 
‘That doesn’t matter,’ rejoined the other. ‘I tell you, you must go to the van 
compartment.’ 
‘I tell you, I was permitted to travel in this comp artment at Durban, and I insist 
on going on in it.’ 
‘No, you won’t,’ said the official. ‘You must leave  this compartment, or else I 
shall have to call a police constable to push you o ut.’ 
‘Yes, you may. I refuse to get out voluntarily.’ 
The constable came. He took me by the hand and push ed me out. My luggage 
was also taken out. I refused to go to the other co mpartment and the train 
steamed away. I went and sat in the waiting room, k eeping my hand-bag with 
me, and leaving the other luggage where it was. The  railway authorities had 
taken charge of it. 
It was winter, and winter in the higher regions of South Africa is severely cold. 
Maritzburg being at a high altitude, the cold was e xtremely bitter. My overcoat 
was in my luggage, but I did not dare to ask for it  lest I should be insulted Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 18  again, so I sat and shivered. There was no light in  the room. A passenger came 
in at about midnight and possibly wanted to talk to  me. But I was in no mood to 
talk. 
I began to think of my duty. Should I fight for my rights or go back to India, or 
should I go on to Pretoria without minding the insu lts, and return to India after 
finishing the case? It would be cowardice to run ba ck to India without fulfilling 
my obligation. The hardship to which I was subjecte d was superficial-only a 
symptom of the deep disease of colour prejudice. I should try, if possible, to 
root out the disease and suffer hardships in the pr ocess. Redress for wrongs I 
should seek only to the extent that would be necess ary for the removal of the 
colour prejudice. 
So I decided to take the next available train to Pr etoria.  AMG, 140-41  
 
My first step was to call a meeting of all the Indi ans in Pretoria and to present 
to them a picture of their condition in the Transva al.  AMG, 157  
 
My speech at this meeting may be said to have been the first public speech in 
my life. I went fairly prepared with my subject, wh ich was about observing 
truthfulness in business. I had always heard the me rchants say that truth was 
not possible in business. I did not think so then, nor do I now. Even today there 
are merchant friends who contend that truth is inco nsistent with business. 
Business, they say, is a very practical affair, and  truth a matter of religion; and 
they argue that practical affairs are one thing, wh ile religion is quite another. 
Pure truth, they hold, is out of the question in bu siness, one can speak it only 
so far as is suitable. I strongly contested the pos ition in my speech and 
awakened the merchants to a sense of their duty, wh ich was twofold. Their 
responsibility to be truthful was all the greater i n foreign land, because the 
conduct of a few Indians was the measure of that of  the millions of their 
fellow-countrymen.  AMG, 157-58  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 19  The consequences of the regulation regarding the us e of footpaths were rather 
serious for me. I always went out for a walk throug h President Street to an 
open plain. President Kruger’s house was in this st reet – a very modest, 
unostentatious building, without a garden, and not distinguishable from other 
houses in its neighbourhood. The houses of many of the millionaires in Pretoria 
were far more pretentious, and were surrounded by g ardens. Indeed President 
Kruger’s simplicity was proverbial. Only the presen ce of a police patrol before 
the house indicated that it belonged to some offici al. I nearly always went 
along the footpath past this patrol without the sli ghtest hitch or hindrance. 
Now the man on duty used to be changed from time to  time. Once one of these 
men, without giving me the slightest warning, witho ut even asking me to leave 
the footpath, pushed and kicked me into the street.  I was dismayed. Before I 
could question him as to his behaviour, Mr. Coates,  who happened to be 
passing the spot on horseback, hailed me and said: 
‘Gandhi, I have seen everything. I shall gladly be your witness in court if you 
proceed against the man. I am very sorry you have b een so rudely assaulted.’ 
‘You need not be sorry,’ I said. ‘What does the poo r man know? All coloured 
people are the same to him. He no doubt treats Negr oes just as he has treated 
me. I have made it a rule not to go to court in res pect of any personal 
grievance. So I do not intend to proceed against hi m.’  AMG, 162-63  
 
The incident deepened my feeling for the Indian set tlers….I thus made an 
intimate study of the hard condition of the Indian settlers, not only by reading 
and hearing about it, but by personal experience. I  saw that South Africa was 
no country for a self-respecting Indian, and my min d became more and more 
occupied with the question as to how this state of things might be 
improved.  AMG, 163-64  
 
The year’s stay in Pretoria was a most valuable exp erience in my life. Here it 
was that I had opportunities of learning public wor k and acquired some 
measure of my capacity for it. Here it was that the  religious spirit within me Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 20  became a living force, and here too I acquired a tr ue knowledge of legal 
practice. AMG, 165  
 
I realized that the true function of a lawyer was t o unite parties given as 
under. The lesson was so indelibly burnt into me th at a large part of my time 
during the twenty years of practice as a lawyer was  occupied in bringing about 
private compromises of hundreds of cases. I lost no thing thereby – not even 
money, certainly not my soul. AMG, 168  
 
The heart’s earnest and pure desire is always fulfi lled. In my own experience I 
have often seen this rule verified. Service of the poor has been my heart’s 
desire, and it has always thrown me amongst the poo r and enabled me to 
identify myself with them. AMG, 190  
 
I had put in scarcely three or four months’ practic e, and the Congress 2 also was 
still in its infancy, when a Tamil man in tattered clothes, head-gear in hand, 
two front teeth broken and his mouth bleeding, stoo d before me trembling and 
weeping. He had been heavily belaboured by his mast er. I learnt all about him 
from my clerk, who was a Tamilian. Balasundaram – a s that was the visitor’s 
name – was serving his indenture under a well-known  European resident of 
Durban. The master, getting angry with him, had los t self-control, and had 
beaten Balasundaram severely, breaking two of his t eeth. 
I sent him to a doctor. In those days only white do ctors were available. I 
wanted a certificate from the doctor about the natu re of the injury 
Balasundaram had sustained. I secured the certifica te, and straightaway took 
the injured man to the magistrate, to whom I submit ted his affidavit. The 
magistrate was indignant when he read it, and issue d a summons against the 
employer.  AMG, 190-91  
 
Balasundaram’s case reached the ears of every inden tured labourer, and I came 
to be regarded as their friend. I hailed this conne ction with delight. A regular Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 21  stream of indentured labourers began to pour into m y office, and I got the best 
opportunity of learning their joys and sorrows.   AMG, 191-92  
 
It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel  themselves honoured by 
the humiliation of their fellow-beings.   AMG, 192  
 
If I found myself entirely absorbed in the service of the community, the reason 
behind it was my desire for self-realization. I had  made the religion of service 
my own, as I felt that God could be realized only t hrough service. And service 
for me was the service of India, because it came to  me without my seeking, 
because I had an aptitude for it. I had gone to Sou th Africa for travel, for 
finding an escape from Kathiawar intrigues and for gaining my own livelihood. 
But as I have said, I found myself in search of God  and striving for self-
realization. AMG, 197  
 
Hardly ever have I known anybody to cherish such lo yalty as I did to the British 
Constitution. I can see now that my love of truth w as at the root of this loyalty. 
It has never been possible for me to simulate loyal ty or, for that matter, any 
other virtue. The National Anthem used to be sung a t every meeting that I 
attended in Natal. I then felt that I must also joi n in the singing. Not that I was 
unaware of the defects in British rule, but I thoug ht that it was on the whole 
acceptable. In those days I believed that British r ule was on the whole 
beneficial to the ruled. 
The colour prejudice that I saw in South Africa was , I thought, quite contrary to 
British traditions, and I believed that it was only  temporary and local. I 
therefore vied with Englishmen in loyalty to the th rone. With careful 
perseverance I learnt the tune of the ‘national ant hem’ and joined in the 
singing whenever it was sung. Whenever there was an  occasion for the 
expression of loyalty without fuss or ostentation, I readily took part in it. Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 22  Never in my life did I exploit this loyalty, never did I seek to gain a selfish end 
by its means. It was for me more in the nature of a n obligation, and I rendered 
it without expecting a reward. AMG, 212  
 
By now I had been three years in South Africa. I ha d got to know the people 
and they had got to know me. In 1896 I asked permis sion to go home for six 
months, for I saw that I was in for a long stay the re. I had established a fairly 
good practice, and could see that people felt the n eed of my presence. So I 
made up my mind to go home, fetch my wife and child ren, and then return and 
settle out there.    AMG, 205  
 
This was my first voyage with my wife and children… .I believed, at the time of 
which I am writing, that in order to look civilized , our dress and manners had 
as far as possible to approximate to the European s tandard. Because, I thought, 
only thus could we have some influence, and without  influence it would not be 
possible to serve the community….I therefore determ ined the style of dress for 
my wife and children….The Parsis used then to be re garded as the most 
civilized people amongst Indians, and so, when the complete European style 
seemed to be unsuited, we adopted the Parsi style…. In the same spirit and with 
even more reluctance they adopted the use of knives  and forks. When my 
infatuation for these signs of civilization wore aw ay, they gave up the knives 
and forks. After having become long accustomed to t he new style, it was 
perhaps no less irksome for them to return to the o riginal mode. But I can see 
today that we feel all the freer and lighter for ha ving cast off the tinsel of 
‘civilization’.    AMG, 229-30  
 
The ship cast anchor in the port of Durban on the e ighteenth or nineteenth of 
December.    AMG, 231  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 23  Our ship was ordered to be put in quarantine until the twenty-third day of our 
sailing from Bombay. But this quarantine order had more than health reasons 
behind it. 
The white residents of Durban had been agitating fo r our repatriation, and the 
agitation was one of the reasons for the order….The  real object of the 
quarantine was thus to coerce the passengers into r eturning to India by 
somehow intimidating them or the agent company. For  now threats began to be 
addressed to us also: ‘If you do not go back, you w ill surely be pushed into the 
sea. But if you consent to return, you may even get  your passage money back.’ 
I constantly moved amongst my fellow passengers che ering them up.   
AMG, 232-33  
 
At last ultimatums were served on the passengers an d me. We were asked to 
submit, if we would escape with our lives. In our r eply the passengers and I 
both maintained our right to land at Port Natal, an d intimated our 
determination to enter Natal at any risk. 
At the end of twenty-three days the ships were perm itted to enter the harbour, 
and orders permitting the passengers to land were p assed.    AMG, 235  
 
As soon as we landed, some youngsters recognized me  and shouted ‘Gandhi, 
Gandhi’. About half a dozen men rushed to the spot and joined in the 
shouting….As we went ahead, the crowd continued to swell, until it became 
impossible to proceed further….Then they pelted me with stones, brickbats and 
rotten eggs. Someone snatched away my turban, whils t others began to batter 
and kick me. I fainted and caught hold of the front  railings of a house and stood 
there to get my breath. But it was impossible. They  came upon me boxing and 
battering. The wife of the Police Superintendent, w ho knew me, happened to 
be passing by. The brave lady came up, opened her p arasol, though there was 
no sun then, and stood between the crowd and me. Th is checked the fury of 
the mob, as it was difficult for them to deliver bl ows on me without harming 
Mrs. Alexander.     AMG, 236-37  Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 24   
The late Mr.Chamberlain, who was then secretary of State the Colonies, cabled 
asking the Natal Government to prosecute my assaila nts. Mr.Escombe sent for 
me, expressed his regret for the injuries I had sus tained, and said: ‘Believe me, 
I cannot feel happy over the least little injury do ne to your person….If you can 
identify the assailants, I am prepared to arrest an d prosecute them. 
Mr.Chamberlain also desires me to do so.’ 
To which I gave the following reply. 
‘I do not want to prosecute anyone. It is possible that I may be able to identify 
one or two of them, but what is the use of getting them punished? Besides, I do 
not hold the assailants to blame. They were given t o understand that I had 
made exaggerated statements in India about the whit es in Natal and 
calumniated them. If they believed these reports, i t is no wonder that they 
were enraged. The leaders and, if you will permit m e to say so, you are to 
blame. You could have guided the people properly, b ut you also believed 
Reuter and assumed that I must have indulged in exa ggeration. I do not want to 
bring anyone to book. I am sure that, when the trut h becomes known, they will 
be sorry for their conduct.    AMG, 239-40  
 
On the day of landing, as soon as the yellow flag w as lowered, a representative 
of The Natal Advertiser had come to interview me. H e had asked me a number 
of questions, and in reply I had been able to refut e every one of the charges 
that had been levelled against me….This interview a nd my refusal to prosecute 
the assailants produced such a profound impression that the Europeans of 
Durban were ashamed of their conduct. The press dec lared me to be innocent 
and condemned the mob. Thus the lynching ultimately  proved to be a blessing 
for me, that is, for the cause. It enhanced the pre stige of the Indian 
community in South Africa and made my work easier.     AMG, 241  
 
My profession progressed satisfactorily, but that w as far from satisfying me….I 
was still ill at ease. I longed for some humanitari an work of a permanent Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 25  nature….So I found time to serve in the small hospi tal. This meant two hours 
every morning, including the time taken in going to  and from the hospital. This 
work brought me some peace. It consisted in ascerta ining the patient’s 
complaints, laying the facts before the doctors and  dispensing the 
prescriptions. It brought me in close touch with su ffering Indians, most of them 
indentured Tamil, Telugu or North Indian men. 
The experience stood me in good stead, when during the Boer War I offered my 
services for nursing the sick and wounded soldiers.     AMG, 249-50  
 
The birth of the last child put me to the severest test. The travail came on 
suddenly. The doctor was not immediately available,  and some time was lost in 
fetching the midwife. Even if she had been on the s pot, she could not have 
helped delivery. I had to see through the safe deli very of the 
baby.     AMG, 250  
 
I am convinced that for the proper upbringing of ch ildren the parents ought to 
have a general knowledge of the care and nursing of  babies. At every step I 
have seen the advantages of my careful study of the  subject. My children would 
not have enjoyed the general health that they do to day, had I not studied the 
subject and turned my knowledge to account. We labo ur under a sort of 
superstition that the child has nothing to learn du ring the first five years of its 
life. On the contrary the fact is that the child ne ver learns in after life what it 
does in its first five years. The education of the child begins with conception. 
AMG, 250-51  
 
The couple who realize these things will never have  sexual union for the 
fulfillment of their lust, but only when they desir e issue. I think it is the height 
of ignorance to believe that the sexual act is an i ndependent function 
necessary like sleeping or eating. The world depend s for its existence on the 
act of generation, and as the world is the playgrou nd of God and a reflection of 
His glory, the act of generation should be controll ed for the ordered growth of Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 26  the world. He who realizes this will control his lu st at any cost, equip himself 
with the knowledge necessary for the physical, ment al and spiritual well-being 
of his progeny, and give benefit of that knowledge to posterity.     AMG, 251  
 
After full discussion and mature deliberation I too k the vow (of brhmacharya) 
in 1906. I had not shared my thoughts with my wife until then, but only 
consulted her at the time of taking the vow. She ha d no objection. But I had 
great difficulty in making the final resolve. I had  not the necessary strength. 
How was I to control my passions? The elimination o f carnal relationship with 
one’s wife seemed then a strange thing. But I launc hed forth with faith in the 
sustaining power of God. 
As I look back upon the twenty years of the vow, I am filled with pleasure and 
wonderment. The more or less successful practice of  self-control had been 
going on since 1901. But the freedom and joy that c ame to me after taking the 
vow had never been experienced before 1906. Before the vow I had been open 
to being overcome by temptation at any moment. Now the vow was a sure 
shield against temptation. AMG, 256  
 
But if it was a matter of ever-increasing joy, let no one believe that it was an 
easy thing for me. Even when I am past fifty-six ye ars, I realize how hard a 
thing it is. Every day I realize more and more that  it is like walking on the 
sword’s edge, and I see every moment the necessity for eternal vigilance. 
Control of the palate is the first essential in the  observance of the vow. I found 
that complete control of the palate made the observ ance very easy, and so I 
now pursued my dietetic experiments not merely from  the vegetarian’s but 
also from the brahmachari’s point of view.     AMG, 257  
 
I know it is argued that the soul has nothing to do  with what one eats or drinks, 
as the soul neither eats nor drinks; that it is not  what you put inside from 
without, but what you express outwardly from within , that matters. There is no 
doubt some force in this. But rather than examine t his reasoning, I shall Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 27  content myself with merely declaring my firm convic tion that, for the seeker 
who would live in fear of God and who would see Him  face to face, restraint in 
diet both as to quantity and quality is as essentia l as restraint in thought and 
speech.     AMG, 334  
 
I had started on a life of ease and comfort, but th e experiment was shortlived. 
Although I had furnished the house with care, yet i t failed to have any hold on 
me. So no sooner had I launched forth on that life,  than I began to cut down 
expenses. The washerman’s bill was heavy, and as he  was besides by no means 
noted for his punctuality, even two to three dozen shirts and collars proved 
insufficient for me. Collars had to be changed dail y and shirts, if not daily, at 
least every alternate day. This meant a double expe nse which appeared to me 
unnecessary. So I equipped myself with a washing ou tfit to save it. I bought a 
book on washing, studied the art and taught it also  to my wife. This no doubt 
added to my work, but its novelty made it a pleasur e. 
I shall never forget the first collar that I washed  myself. I had used more starch 
than necessary, the iron had not been made hot enou gh, and for fear of 
burning the collar I had not pressed it sufficientl y. The result was that, though 
the collar was fairly stiff, the superfluous starch  continually dropped off it. I 
went to court with the collar on, thus inviting the  ridicule of brother barristers, 
but even in those days I could be impervious to rid icule.    AMG, 261  
 
In the same way, as I freed myself from slavery to the washerman, I threw off 
dependence on the barber. All people who go to Engl and learn there at least 
the art of shaving, but none, to my knowledge, lear n to cut their own hair. I 
had to learn that too. I once went to an English ha ircutter in Pretoria. He 
contemptuously refused to cut my hair. I certainly felt hurt, but immediately 
purchased a pair of clippers and cut my hair before  the mirror. I succeeded 
more or less in cutting the front hair, but I spoil ed the back. The friends in the 
court shook with laughter. 
‘What’s wrong with your hair, Gandhi? Rats have bee n at it?’ Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 28  ‘No the white barber would not condescend to touch my black hair,’ said I, ‘so 
I preferred to cut it myself, no matter how badly.’  
The reply did not surprise the friends. 
The barber was not at fault in having refused to cu t my hair. There was every 
chance of his losing his custom, if he should serve  black men.     AMG, 262-63  
 
When the war (Boer) was declared, my personal sympa thies were all with the 
Boers, but I believed then that I had yet no right,  in such cases, to enforce my 
individual convictions. I have minutely dealt with the inner struggle regarding 
this in my history of the Satyagraha in South Afric a, and I must not repeat the 
argument here. I invite the curious to turn to thos e pages. Suffice it to say that 
my loyalty to the British rule drove me to particip ation with the British in that 
war. I felt that, if I demanded rights as a British  citizen, it was also my duty, as 
such, to participate in the defense of the British Empire. I held then that India 
could achieve her complete emancipation only within  and through the British 
Empire. So I collected together as many comrades as  possible, and with very 
great difficulty got their services accepted as an ambulance corps.    AMG, 264  
 
Thus service of the Indians in South Africa ever re vealed to me new 
implications of truth at every stage. Truth is like  a vast tree, which yields more 
and more fruit the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of 
truth the richer the discovery of the gems buried t here, in the shape of 
openings for an ever greater variety of service.     AMG, 268  
 
Man and his deed are two distinct things. Whereas a  good deed should call for 
approbation and a wicked deed dis-approbation, the doer of the deed, whether 
good or wicked, always deserves respect or pity as the case may be. ‘Hate the 
sin and not the sinner’ is a precept which, though easy enough to understand is 
rarely practised, and that is why the poison of hat red spreads in the world. 
This ahimsa is the basis of the search for truth. I  am realizing every day that 
the search is vain unless it is founded on ahimsa a s the basis. It is quite proper Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 29  to resist and attack a system, but to resist and at tack its author is tantamount 
to resisting and attacking oneself. For we are all tarred with the same brush, 
and are children of one and the same Creator, and a s such the divine powers 
within us are infinite. To slight a single human be ing is to slight those divine 
powers, and thus to harm not only that being but wi th him the whole 
world.     AMG, 337  
 
A variety of incidents in my life have conspired to  bring me in close contact 
with people of many creeds and many communities, an d my experience with all 
of them warrants the statement that I have known no  distinction between 
relatives and strangers, countrymen and foreigners,  white and coloured, Hindus 
and Indians of other faiths, whether Musalmans, Par sis, Christians or Jews. I 
may say that my heart has been incapable of making any such 
distinctions.     AMG, 338  
 
I am not a profound scholar of Sanskrit. I have rea d the Vedas and the 
Upnishads only in translations. Naturally, therefor e, mine is not a scholarly 
study of them. My knowledge of them is in no way pr ofound, but I have studied 
them as I should do as a Hindu and I claim to have grasped their true spirit. By 
the time I had reached the age of twenty-one, I had  studied other religions 
also. 
There was a time when I was wavering between Hindui sm and Christianity. 
When I recovered my balance of mind, I felt that to  me salvation was possible 
only through the Hindu religion and my faith in Hin duism grew deeper and more 
enlightened. 
But even then I believed that untouchability was no  part of Hinduism; and that, 
if it was, such Hinduism was not for me.     MT, II, 49  
 
I understand more clearly today what I read long ag o about the inadequacy of 
all autobiography as history. I know that I do not set down in this story all that I 
remember. Who can say how much I must give and how much omit in the Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 30  interest of truth? And what would be the value in a  court of law of the 
inadequate ex parte evidence being tendered by me o f certain events in my 
life? If some busybody were to cross-examine me on the chapters already 
written, he could probably shed much more light on them, and if it were a 
hostile critic’s cross-examination, he might even f latter himself for having 
shown up ‘the hollowness of many of my pretensions’ . 
I therefore wonder for a moment whether it might no t be proper to stop 
writing these chapters. But so long as there is no prohibition from the voice 
within, I must continue the writing. I must follow the sage maxim that nothing 
once begun should be abandoned unless it is proved to be morally 
wrong.     AMG, 342  
 
In the very first month of Indian Opinion 3, I realized that the sole aim of 
journalism should be service. The newspaper press i s a great power, but just as 
an unchained torrent of water submerges whole count rysides and devastates 
crops, even so an uncontrolled pen serves but to de stroy. If the control is from 
without, it proves more poisonous than want of cont rol. It can be profitable 
only when exercised from within. If this line of re asoning is correct, how many 
of the journals in the world would stand the test? But who would stop those 
that are useless? And who should be the judge? The useful and the useless 
must, like good and evil generally, go on together,  and man must make his 
choice.     AMG, 349  
 
This (unto This Last) was the first book of Ruskin I had ever read. During the 
days of my education I had read practically nothing  outside textbooks, and 
after I launched into active life I had very little  time for reading. I cannot 
therefore claim much book knowledge. However, I bel ieve I have not lost much 
because of this enforced restraint. On the contrary , the limited reading may be 
said to have enabled me thoroughly to digest what I  did read. Of these books, 
the one that brought about an instantaneous and pra ctical transformation in Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 31  my life was Unto This Last. I translated it later i nto Gujarati, entitling it 
Sarvodaya (the welfare of all). 
I believe that I discovered some of my deepest conv ictions reflected in this 
great book of Ruskin, and that is why it is so capt ured me and made me 
transform my life. A poet is one who can call forth  the good latent in the 
human breast. Poets do not influence all alike, for  everyone is not evolved in 
an equal measure.     AMG, 364-65  
 
Even after I thought I had settled down in Johannes burg, there was to be no 
settled life for me. Just when I felt that I should  be breathing in peace, an 
unexpected event happened. The papers brought the n ews of the outbreak of 
the Zulu ‘rebellion’ in Natal. I bore no grudge aga inst the Zulus, they had 
harmed no Indian. I had doubts about the ‘rebellion ’ itself. But I then believed 
that the British Empire existed for the welfare of the world. A genuine sense of 
loyalty prevented me from even wishing ill to the E mpire. The rightness or 
otherwise of the ‘rebellion’ was therefore not like ly to affect my decision. 
Natal had a Volunteer Defense Force, and it was ope n to it to recruit more 
men. I read that this force had already been mobili zed to quell the ‘rebellion’.  
AMG, 383  
 
On reaching the scene of the ‘rebellion’ I saw that  there was nothing there to 
justify the name of ‘rebellion’. There was no resis tance that one could see. 
The reason why the disturbance had been magnified i nto a rebellion was that a 
Zulu chief had advised non-payment of a new tax imp osed on his people, and 
had assagaied a sergeant who had gone to collect th e tax. At any rate my heart 
was with the Zulus, and I was delighted, on reachin g headquarters, to hear that 
our main work was to be the nursing of the wounded Zulus. The medical officer 
in charge welcomed us. He said the white people wer e not willing nurses for 
the wounded Zulus, that their wounds were festering , and that he was at his 
wits’ end. He hailed our arrival as a godsend for t hose innocent people, and he 
equipped us with bandages, disinfectants, etc., and  took us to the improvised Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 32  hospital. The Zulus were delighted to see us. White  soldiers used to peep 
through the railings that separated us from them an d tried to dissuade us from 
attending to the wounds. And as we would not heed t hem, they became 
enraged and poured unspeakable abuse on the Zulus.     AMG, 384  
 
The wounded in our charge were not wounded in battl e. A section of them had 
been taken prisoners as suspects. The general had s entenced them to be 
flogged. The flogging had caused severe sores. Thes e, being unattended to, 
were festering. The others were Zulu friendlies. Al though these had badges 
given them to distinguish them from the ‘enemy’ the y had been shot at by the 
soldiers by mistake.     AMG, 385  
 
The Zulu ‘rebellion’ was full of new experience and  gave me much food for 
thought. The Boer War had not brought home to me th e horrors of war with 
anything like the vividness that the ‘rebellion’ di d. This was no war but a man-
hunt, not only in my opinion, but also in that of m any Englishmen with whom I 
had occasion to talk. To hear every morning reports  of soldiers’ rifles exploding 
like crackers in innocent hamlets, and to live in t he midst of them was a trial. 
But I swallowed the bitter draught, especially as t he work of my corps 
consisted only in nursing the wounded Zulus. I coul d see that but for us the 
Zulus would have been uncared for. This work, there fore, eased my 
conscience.     AMG, 386  
 
I was anxious to observe brahmacharya in thought, w ord and deed, and equally 
anxious to devote the maximum time to the Satyagrah a struggle and fit myself 
for it by cultivating purity. I was therefore led t o make further changes and to 
impose greater restraints upon myself in the matter  of food. The motive for the 
previous changes has been largely hygienic, but the  new experiments were 
made from a religious standpoint. 
Fasting and restriction in diet now played a more i mportant part in my life. 
Passion in man is generally co-existent with hanker ing after the pleasures of Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 33  the palate. And so it was with me. I have encounter ed many difficulties in 
trying to control passion as well as taste, and I c annot claim even now to have 
brought them under complete subjection. I have cons idered myself to be a 
heavy eater. What friends have thought to be my res traint has never appeared 
to me in that light. If I had failed to develop res traint to the extent that I have, 
I should have descended lower than the beasts and m et my doom long ago. 
However, as I had adequately realized my shortcomin gs, I made great efforts to 
get rid of them, and thanks to this endeavour I hav e all these years pulled on 
with my body and out in with it my share of work.     AMG, 391  
 
I began with a fruit diet, but from the standpoint of restraint I did not find 
much to choose between a fruit diet and a diet of f ood grains. I observed that 
the same indulgence of taste was possible with the former as with the latter, 
and even more, when one got accustomed to it. I the refore came to attach 
greater importance to fasting or having only one me al a day on holidays. And if 
there was some occasion for penance or the like, I gladly utilized it too for the 
purpose of fasting. 
But I also saw that, the body now being drained mor e effectively, the food 
yielded greater relish and appetite grew keener. It  dawned upon me that 
fasting could be made as powerful a weapon of indul gence as of restraint. Many 
similar later experiences of mine as well as of oth ers can be adduced as 
evidence of this startling fact. I wanted to improv e and train my body, but as 
my chief object now was to achieve restraint and a conquest of the palate, I 
selected first one food and then another, and at th e same time, restricted the 
amount. But the relish was after me, as it were. As  I gave up one thing and 
took up another, this latter afforded me a fresher and greater relish than its 
predecessor.     AMG, 391-92  
 
Experience has taught me, however, that it was wron g to have dwelt upon the 
relish of food. One should eat not in order to plea se the palate, but just to 
keep the body going. When each organ of sense subse rves the body and through Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 34  the body the soul, its special relish disappears, a nd then alone does it begin to 
function in the way nature intended it to do. 
Any number of experiments is too small and no sacri fice is too great for 
attaining this symphony with nature. But unfortunat ely the current is nowadays 
flowing strongly in the opposite direction. We are not ashamed to sacrifice a 
multitude of other lives in decorating the perishab le body and trying to prolong 
its existence for a few fleeting moments, with the result that we kill ourselves, 
both body and soul.     AMG, 392-93  
 
My first experience of jail life was in 1908. I saw  that some of the regulations 
that the prisoners had to observe were such as shou ld be voluntarily observed 
by a brahmachari, that is, one desiring to practise  self-restraint. Such, for 
instance, was the regulation requiring the last mea l to be finished before 
sunset. Neither the Indian nor the African prisoner s were allowed tea or coffee. 
They could add salt to the cooked food if they wish ed, but they might not have 
anything for the mere satisfaction of the palate.     AMG, 398  
 
Ultimately these restrictions were modified, though  not without much 
difficulty, but both were wholesome rules of self-r estraint. Inhibitions imposed 
from without rarely succeed, but when they are self -imposed, they have a 
decidedly salutary effect. So, immediately after re lease from jail, I imposed on 
myself the two rules. As far as was then possible I  stopped taking tea, and 
finished my last meal before sunset. Both these now  require no effort in the 
observance.    AMG, 398  
 
Fasting can help to curb animal passion, only if it  is undertaken with a view to 
self-restraint. Some of my friends have actually fo und their animal passion and 
palate stimulated as an after-effect of fasts. That  is to say, fasting is futile 
unless it is accompanied by an incessant longing fo r self-restraint.     AMG, 406  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 35  Fasting and similar discipline is, therefore, one o f the means to the end of self-
restraint, but it is not all, and if physical fasti ng is not accompanied by mental 
fasting, it is bound to end in hypocrisy and disast er.  AMG, 406  
 
On Tolstoy Farm 4 we made it a rule that the youngsters should not b e asked to 
do what the teachers did not do, and therefore, whe n they were asked to do 
any work, there was always a teacher cooperating an d actually working with 
them. Hence whatever the youngsters learnt, they le arnt cheerfully. AMG, 409  
 
Of textbooks, about which we hear so much, I never felt the want. I do not 
even remember having made much use of the books tha t were available. I did 
not find it at all necessary to load the boys with quantities of books. I have 
always felt that the true textbook for the pupil is  his teacher. I remember very 
little that my teacher taught me from books, but I have even now a clear 
recollection of the things they taught me independe ntly of books. 
Children take in much more and with less labour thr ough their ears than 
through their eyes. I do not remember having read a ny book from cover to 
cover with my boys. But I gave them, in my own lang uage, all that I had 
digested from my reading of various books, and I da re say they are still carrying 
a recollection of it in their minds. It was laborio us for them to remember what 
they learnt from books but what I imparted to them by word of mouth they 
could repeat with the greatest ease. Reading was a task for them, but listening 
to me was a pleasure, when I did not bore them by f ailure to make my subject 
interesting. And from the questions that my talks p rompted them to put, I had 
a measure of their power of understanding.      AMG, 411-12  
 
Just as physical training was to be imparted throug h physical exercise, even so 
the training of the spirit was possible only throug h the exercise of the spirit. 
And the exercise of the spirit entirely depended on  the life and character of 
the teacher. The teacher had always to be mindful o f his p’s and q’s, whether 
he was in the midst of his boys or not.      AMG, 414  Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 36   
It would be idle for me, if I were a liar, to teach  boys to tell the truth. A 
cowardly teacher would never succeed in making his boys valiant, and a 
stranger to self-restraint could never teach his pu pils the value of self-
restraint. I saw, therefore, that I must be an eter nal object-lesson to the boys 
and girls living with me. They thus became my teach ers, and I learnt I must be 
good and live straight if only for their sakes. I m ay say that the increasing 
discipline and restraint I imposed on myself at Tol stoy Farm was mostly due to 
those wards of mine. 
One of them was wild, unruly, given to lying, and q uarrelsome. On one 
occasion he broke out most violently. I was exasper ated. I never punished my 
boys, but this time I was very angry. I tried to re ason with him. But he was 
adamant and even tried to overreach me. At last I p icked up a ruler lying at 
hand and delivered a blow on his arm. I trembled as  I struck him. I dare say he 
noticed it. This was an entirely novel experience f or them all. The boy cried 
out and begged to be forgiven. He cried not because  the beating was painful to 
him; he could, if he had been so minded, have paid me back in the same coin, 
being a stoutly built youth of seventeen; but he re alized my pain in being 
driven to this violent resource. Never again after this incident did he disobey 
me. But I still repent that violence. I am afraid I  exhibited before him that day 
not the spirit, but the brute, in me. 
I have always been opposed to corporal punishment. I remember only one 
occasion on which I physically punished one of my s ons. I have therefore never 
until this day been able to decide whether I was ri ght or wrong in using the 
ruler. Probably it was improper, for it was prompte d by anger and a desire to 
punish. Had it been an expression only of my distre ss, I should have considered 
it justified. But the motive in this case was mixed .     AMG, 414-15  
 
Cases of misconduct on the part of the boys often o ccurred after this, but I 
never resorted to corporal punishment. Thus in my e ndeavour to impart Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 37  spiritual training to the boys and girls under me, I came to understand better 
and better the power of the spirit.      AMG, 415  
 
In those days I had to move between Johannesburg an d Phoenix. Once when I 
was in Johannesburg I received tidings of the moral  fall of two of the inmates 
of the ashram. News of an apparent failure of rever se in the Satyagraha 
struggle would not have shocked me, but this news c ame upon me like a 
thunderbolt. The same day I took the train for phoe nix.     AMG, 418  
 
During the journey my duty seemed clear to me. I fe lt that the guardian or 
teacher was responsible, to some extent at least, f or the lapse of his ward or 
pupil. So my responsibility regarding the incident in question became clear to 
me as daylight. My wife had already warned me in th e matter, but being of 
trusting nature, I had ignored her caution. I felt that the only way the guilty 
parties could be made to realize my distress and th e depth of their own fall 
would be for me to do some penance. So I imposed up on myself a fast for seven 
days and vow to have only one meal a day for a peri od of four months and a 
half.      AMG, 418-19  
 
My penance pained everybody, but it cleared the atm osphere. Everyone came 
to realize what a terrible thing it was to be sinfu l, and the bond that bound me 
to the boys and girls became stronger and truer.   AMG, 419  
 
I never resorted to untruth in my profession, and…a  large part of my legal 
practice was in the interest of public work, for wh ich I charged nothing beyond 
out-of-pocket expenses, and these too I sometimes m et myself….As a student I 
had heard that the lawyer’s profession was a liar’s  profession. But this did not 
influence me, as I had no intention of earning eith er position or money by 
lying….My principle was put to the test many a time  in South Africa. Often I 
knew that my opponents had tutored their witnesses and if I only encouraged 
my client or his witnesses to lie, we could win the  case. But I always resisted Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 38  the temptation. I remember only one occasion, when,  after having won a case, 
I suspected that my client had deceived me. In my h eart of hearts I always 
wished that I should win only if my client’s case w as right. In fixing my fees I do 
not recall ever havig made them conditional on my w inning the case. Whether 
my client won or lost, I expected nothing more nor less than my fees. 
I warned every new client at the outset that he sho uld not expect me to take 
up a false case or to coach the witnesses, with the  result that I built up such a 
reputation that no false cases used to come to me. Indeed some of my clients 
would keep their clean cases for me, and take the d oubtful ones elsewhere. 
AMG, 443-44  
 
During my professional work it was also my habit ne ver to conceal my 
ignorance from my clients or my colleagues. Whereve r I felt myself at sea, I 
would advise my client to consult some other counse l. This frankness earned 
me the unbounded affection and trust of my clients.  They were always willing 
to pay the fee whenever consultation with senior co unsel was necessary. This 
affection and trust served me in good stead in my p ublic work.      AMG, 449  
 
At the conclusion of Satyagraha struggle in 1914, I  received Gokhale’s 
instruction to return home via London….War was decl ared on the fourth of 
August. We reached London on the sixth.      AMG, 421-23  
 
I felt that Indians residing in England ought to do  their bit in the war. English 
students had volunteered to serve in the army, and Indians might do no less. A 
number of objections were taken to this line of arg ument. There was, it was 
contended, a world of difference between the Indian s and the English. We 
were slaves and they were masters. How could a slav e co-operate with the 
master in the hour of the latter’s need? Was it not  the duty of the slave, 
seeking to be free, to make the master’s need his o pportunity? This argument 
failed to appeal to me then. I knew the difference of status between an Indian 
and an Englishman, but I did not believe that we ha d been quite reduced to Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 39  slavery. I felt then that it was more the fault of individual British officials than 
of the British system, and that we could convert th em by love. If we would 
improve our status through the help and co-operatio n of the British, it was our 
duty to win their help by standing by them in their  hour of need. Though the 
system was faulty, it did not seem to me to be into lerable, as it does today. 
But if, having lost my faith the system, I refuse t o co-operate with the British 
Government today, how could those friends then do s o, having lost their faith 
not only in the system but in the official as well?       AMG, 424-25  
 
I thought that England’s need should not be turned into our opportunity, and 
that it was more becoming and far-sighted not to pr ess our demands while the 
war lasted. I therefore adhered to my advice and in vited those who would 
enlist as volunteers.      AMG, 425  
 
All of us recognized the immorality of war. If I wa s not prepared to prosecute 
my assailant, much less should I be willing to part icipate in a war, especially 
when I knew nothing of the justice or otherwise of the cause of the 
combatants. Friends of course knew that I had previ ously served in the Boer 
War, but they assumed that my views had since under gone a change. 
As a matter of fact the very same line of argument that persuaded me to take 
part in the Boer War had weighed with me on this oc casion. It was quite clear 
to me that participation in war could never be cons istent with ahimsa. But it is 
not always given to one to be equally clear about o ne’s duty. A votary of truth 
is often obliged to grope in the dark.      AMG, 427  
 
By enlisting men for ambulance work in South Africa  and in England, and 
recruits for field service in India, I helped not t he cause of war, but I helped 
the institution called the British Empire in whose ultimate beneficial character 
I then believed. My repugnance to war was as strong  then as it is today; and I 
could not then have and would not have shouldered a  rifle. But one’s life is not 
a single straight line; it is a bundle of duties ve ry often conflicting. And one is Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 40  called upon continually to make one’s choice betwee n one duty and another. 
As a citizen not then, and not even now, a reformer  leading an agitation 
against the institution of war, I had to advise and  lead men who believed in 
war but who from cowardice or from base motives, or  from anger against the 
British Government, refrained from enlisting. I did  not hesitate to advise them 
that so long as they believed in war and professed loyalty to the British 
constitution they were in duty bound to support it by enlistment….I do not 
believe in retaliation, but I did not hesitate to t ell the villagers near Bettia four 
years ago that they who knew nothing of ahimsa were  guilty of cowardice in 
failing to defend the honour of their womenfolk and  their property by force of 
arms. And I have not hesitated…only recently to tel l the Hindus that if they do 
not believe in out-and-out ahimsa and cannot practi ce it they will be guilty of a 
crime against their religion and humanity if they f ailed to defend by force of 
arms the honour of their women against a kidnapper who chooses to take away 
their women. And all this advice and my previous pr actice I hold to be not only 
consistent with my profession of the religion of ah imsa out-and-out, but a 
direct result of it. To state that noble doctrine i s simple enough; to know it and 
to practise it in the midst of a world full of stri fe, turmoil and passions is a task 
whose difficulty I realize more and more day by day . And yet the conviction too 
that without it life is not worth living is growing  daily deeper.      SB 167-68  
 
There is no defence for my conduct weighed only in the scales of ahimsa, I 
draw no distinction between those who wield the wea pons of destruction and 
those who do Red Cross work. Both participate in wa r and advance its cause. 
Both are guilty of the crime of war. But even after  introspection during all 
these years, I feel that in the circumstances in wh ich I found myself I was 
bound to adopt the course I did both during the Boe r War and the Great 
European War and for that matter the so-called-Zulu  ‘rebellion’ of Natal in 
1906. 
Life is governed by a multitude of forces. It would  be smooth sailing, if one 
could determine the course of one’s actions only by  one general principle Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 41  whose application at a given moment was too obvious  to need even a moment’s 
reflection. But I cannot recall a single act which could be so easily determined. 
Being a confirmed war resister I have never given m yself training in the use of 
destructive weapons in spite of opportunities to ta ke such training. It was 
perhaps thus that I escaped direct destruction of h uman life. But so long as I 
lived under a system of government based on force a nd voluntarily partook of 
the many facilities and privileges it created for m e, I was bound to help that 
government to the extent of my ability when it was engaged in a war unless I 
non-co-operated with that government and renounced to the utmost of my 
capacity the privileges it offered me. 
Let me take an illustration. I am a member of an in stitution which holds a few 
acres of land whose crops are in imminent peril fro m monkeys. I believe in the 
sacredness of all life and hence I regard it a brea ch of ahimsa to inflict any 
injury on the monkeys. But I do not hesitate to ins tigate and direct an attack 
on the monkeys in order to save the crops. I would like to avoid this evil. I can 
avoid it by leaving or breaking up the institution.  I do not do so because I do 
not expect to be able to find a society where there  will be no agriculture and 
therefore no destruction of some life. In fear and trembling, in humility and 
penance, I therefore participate in the injury infl icted on the monkeys, hoping 
some day to find a way out. 
Even so did I participate in the three acts of war.  I could not, it would be 
madness for me to, sever my connexions with the soc iety to which I belong. 
And on those three occasions I had no thought of no n-co-operating with the 
British Government. My position regarding the Gover nment is totally different 
today and hence I should not voluntarily participat e in its wars and I should risk 
imprisonment and even the gallows if I was forced t o take up arms or otherwise 
take part in its military operations. 
But that still does not solve the riddle. If there was a national government, 
whilst I should not take any direct part in any war  I can conceive occasions 
when it would be my duty to vote for the military t raining of those who wish to 
take it. For I know that all its members do not bel ieve in non-violence to the Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 42  extent I do. It is not possible to make a person or  society non-violent by 
compulsion. 
Non-violence works in a most mysterious manner. Oft en a man’s actions defy 
analysis in terms of non-violence; equally often hi s actions may wear the 
appearance of violence when he is absolutely non-vi olent in the highest sense 
of the term and is subsequently found so to be. All  I can then claim for my 
conduct is that it was in the instances cited actua ted in the interests of non-
violence. There was no thought of sordid national o r other interest. I do not 
believe in the promotion of national or any other i nterest at the sacrifice of 
some other interest. 
I may not carry my argument any further. Language a t best is but a poor 
vehicle for expressing one’s thoughts in full. For me non-violence is not a mere 
philosophical principle. It is the rule and the bre ath of my life. I know I fail 
often, sometimes consciously, more often unconsciou sly. It is a matter not of 
the intellect but of the heart. True guidance comes  by constant waiting upon 
God, by utmost humility, self-abnegation, by being ever ready to sacrifice 
one’s self. Its practice requires fearlessness and courage of the highest order. I 
am painfully aware of my failings. 
But the Light within me is steady and clear. There is no escape for any of us 
save through truth and non-violence. I know that wa r is wrong, is an 
unmitigated evil. I know too that it has got to go.  I firmly believe that freedom 
won through bloodshed or fraud is no freedom. Would  that all the acts alleged 
against me were found to be wholly indefensible rat her than that by any act of 
mine non-violence was held to be compromised or tha t I was ever thought to be 
in favour of violence or untruth in any shape or fo rm! Not violence, not untruth 
but non-violence, Truth is the law of our being.      SB 168-70  
 
I am conscious of my own limitations. That consciou sness is my only strength. 
Whatever I might have been able to do in my life ha s proceeded more than 
anything else out of the realization of my own limi tations.      SB, 214  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 43  I am used to misrepresentation all my life. It is t he lot of every public worker. 
He has to have a tough hide. Life would be burdenso me if every 
misrepresentation has to be answered and cleared. I t is a rule of life with me 
never to explain misrepresentations except when the  cause required 
correction. This rule has saved much time and worry .      SB, 214  
 
The only virtue I want to claim is truth and non-vi olence. I lay no claim to 
superhuman powers. I want none. I wear the same cor ruptible flesh that the 
weakest of my fellow beings wears and am liable to err as any. My services 
have many limitations, but God has up to now blesse d them in spite of the 
imperfections. 
For confessions of error is like a broom that sweep s away dirt and leaves the 
surface cleaner than before. I feel stronger for my  confession. And the cause 
must prosper for the retracing. Never has man reach ed his destination by 
persistence in deviation from the straight path.      MT, II, 113  
 
The mahatma I leave to his fate. Though a non-co-op erator I shall gladly 
subscribe to a Bill to make it criminal for anybody  to call me mahatma and to 
touch my feet. Where I can impose the law myself, a t the ashram, the practice 
is criminal.      MT, II, 340  
 
The time has now come to bring these chapters to a close….My life from this 
point onward has been so public that there is hardl y anything about it that 
people do not know….My life has been an open book. I have no secrets and I 
encourage no secrets.      AMG, 614, see also MM, 4  
 
My uniform experience has convinced me that there i s no other God than 
Truth. And if every page of these chapters does not  proclaim to the reader that 
the only means for the realization of Truth is ahim sa, I shall deem all my labour 
in writing these chapters to have been in vain. And , even though my efforts in Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 44  this behalf may prove fruitless, let the readers kn ow that the vehicle, not the 
great principle, is at fault.  AMG, 615  
 
Ever since my return to India I have had the experi ences of the dormant 
passions lying hidden within me. The knowledge of t hem has made me feel 
humiliated though not defeated. The experiences and  experiments have 
sustained me and given me great joy. But I know tha t I have still before me a 
difficult path to traverse. I must reduce myself to  zero. So long as a man does 
not of his own free will put himself last among his  fellow creatures, there is no 
salvation for him. Ahimsa is the farthest limit of humility.   AMG, 616  
 
I have become literally sick of the adoration of th e unthinking multitude. I 
would feel certain of my ground if I was spat upon by them. Then there would 
be no need for confession of Himalayan and other mi scalculations, no 
retracing, no re-arranging.      MM, 7  
 
I have no desire for prestige anywhere. It is furni ture required in courts of 
kings. I am a servant of Mussulmans, Christians, Pa rsis and Jews as I am of 
Hindus. And a servant is in need of love, not prest ige. That is assured to me so 
long as I remain a faithful servant.      MM, 8  
 
Somehow or other I dread a visit to Europe and Amer ica. Not that I distrust the 
peoples of these great continents any more than I d istrust my own, but I 
distrust myself. I have no desire to go to the West  in search of health or for 
sightseeing. I have no desire to deliver public spe eches. I detest being lionized. 
I wonder if I shall ever again have the health to s tand the awful strain of public 
speaking and public demonstrations. If God ever sen t me to the West, I should 
go there to penetrate the hearts of the masses, to have quiet talks with the 
youth of the West and have the privilege of meeting  kindred spirits – lovers of 
peace at any price save that of truth. Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 45  But I feel that I have as yet no message to deliver  personally to the West. I 
believe my message to be universal but as yet I fee l that I can best deliver it 
through my work in my own country. If I can show vi sible success in India, the 
delivery of the message becomes complete. If I came  to the conclusion that 
India had no use for my message, I should not care to go elsewhere in search of 
listeners even though I still retained faith in it.  If I ventured out of India, I 
should do so because I have faith, though I cannot demonstrate it to the 
satisfaction of all, that the message is being rece ived by India, be it ever so 
slowly. 
Thus whilst I was hesitatingly carrying on the corr espondence with friends who 
had invited me, I saw that there was need for me to  go to Europe, if only to 
Romain Rolland. Owing to my distrust of myself over  a general visit, I wanted 
to make my visit to that wise man of the West the p rimary cause of my journey 
to Europe. I, therefore, referred my difficulty to him and asked him in the 
frankest manner possible whether he would let me ma ke my desire to meet 
him the primary cause of my visit to Europe. He say s that in the name of truth 
itself, he will not think of letting me go to Europ e if a visit to him is to be the 
primary cause. He will not let me interrupt my labo urs here for the sake of our 
meeting. Apart from this visit I felt within me no imperative call. I regret my 
decision but it seems to be the correct one. For wh ilst there is no urge within 
to go to Europe, there is an incessant call within for so much to do 
here.      MM, II, 417  
 
I hold myself to be incapable of hating any being o n earth. By a long course of 
prayerful discipline, I have ceased for over forty years to hate anybody. I know 
this is a big claim. Nevertheless, I make it in all  humility. But I can and do hate 
evil wherever it exists I hate the system of govern ment that the British people 
have set up in India. I hate the ruthless exploitat ion of India even as I hate 
from the bottom of my heart the hideous system of u ntouchability for which 
millions of Hindus have made themselves responsible . But I do not hate the 
domineering Englishmen as I refuse to hate the domi neering Hindus. I seek to 
reform them in all the loving ways that are open to  me.     SB, 150  Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 46   
Some days back a calf having been maimed lay in ago ny in the ashram. 
Whatever treatment and nursing was possible was giv en to it. The surgeon 
whose advice was sought in the matter declared the case to be past help and 
past hope. The suffering of the animal was so great  that it could not even turn 
its side without excruciating pain. 
In these circumstances I felt that humanity demande d that the agony should be 
ended by ending life itself. The matter was placed before the whole ashram. At 
the discussion, a worthy neighbour vehemently oppos ed the idea of killing even 
to end pain. The ground of his opposition was that one has no right to take life 
which one cannot create. His argument seemed to me to be pointless here. It 
would have point, if the taking of life was actuate d by self-interest. Finally in 
all humility but with the clearest of convictions I  got in my presence a doctor 
kindly to administer the calf a quietus by means of  a poison injection. The 
whole thing was over in less than two minutes. 
I knew that public opinion especially in Ahmedabad would not approve of my 
action and that it would read nothing but himsa in it. But I know too that 
performance of one’s duty should be independent of public opinion. I have all 
along held that one is bound to act according to wh at to one appears to be 
right, though it may appear wrong to others. And ex perience has shown that 
that is the only correct course. That is why the po et has sung: ‘The path way of 
love is the ordeal of fire, the shrinkers turn away  from it.’ The pathway of 
ahimsa, that is, of love, one has often to tread al l alone. 
The question may legitimately be put to me: Would I  apply to human beings the 
principle I have enunciated in connexion with the c alf? Would I like it to be 
applied in my own case? My reply is ‘Yes’; the same  law holds good in both the 
cases. The law, ‘as with one so with all’, admits o f no exceptions, or the killing 
of the calf was wrong and violent. In practice, how ever, we do not cut short 
the sufferings of our ailing dear ones by death bec ause, as a rule, we have 
always means at our disposal to help them and they have the capacity to think 
and decide for themselves. But supposing that in th e case of an ailing friend, I Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 47  am unable to render any aid and recovery is out of the question and the patient 
is lying in an unconscious state in the throes of a gony, then I would not see any 
himsa in putting an end to his suffering by death. 
Just as a surgeon does not commit himsa but practis es the purest ahimsa when 
he wields his knife, one may find it necessary, und er certain imperative 
circumstances, to go a step further and sever life from the body in the interest 
of the sufferer. It may be objected that whereas th e surgeon performs his 
operation to save the life of the patient, in the o ther case we do just the 
reverse. But on a deeper analysis it will be found that the ultimate object 
sought to be served in both the cases is the same, namely, to relieve the 
suffering soul within from pain. In the one case yo u do it by severing the 
diseased portion from the body, in the other you do  it by severing from the soul 
the body that has become an instrument of torture t o it. In either case it is the 
relief of the soul from pain that is aimed at, the body without the life within 
being incapable of feeling either pleasure or pain.  Other circumstances can be 
imagined in which not to kill would spell himsa, wh ile killing would be ahimsa. 
Suppose, for instance, that I find my daughter, who se wish at the moment I 
have no means of ascertaining, is threatened with v iolation and there is no way 
by which I can save her, then it would be the pures t form of ahimsa on my part 
to put an end to her life and surrender myself to t he fury of the incensed 
ruffian. 
The trouble with our votaries of ahimsa is that the y have made of ahimsa a 
blind fetish and put the greatest obstacle in the w ay of the spread of true 
ahimsa in our midst. The current – and, in my opini on, mistaken – view of 
ahimsa has drugged our conscience and rendered us i nsensible to a host of 
other and more insidious forms of himsa like harsh words, harsh judgements, ill 
will, anger, spite and lust of cruelty; it has made  us forget that there may be 
far more himsa in the slow torture of men and anima ls, the starvation and 
exploitation to which they are subjected out of sel fish greed, the wanton 
humiliation and oppression of the weak and the kill ing of their self-respect that 
we witness all around us today than in mere benevol ent taking of life. Does any 
one doubt for a moment that it would have been far more humane to have Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 48  summarily put to death those who in the infamous la ne of Amritsar were made 
by their tortures to crawl on their bellies like wo rms? If anyone desires to 
retort by saying that these people themselves today  feel otherwise, that they 
are none the worse for crawling, I shall have no he sitation in telling him that 
he does not know even the elements of ahimsa. There  arise occasions in a 
man’s life when it becomes his imperative duty to m eet them by laying down 
his life; not to appreciate this fundamental fact o f man’s estate is to betray an 
ignorance of the foundation of ahimsa. For instance , a votary of truth would 
pray to God to give him death to save him from a li fe of falsehood. Similarly a 
votary of ahimsa would on bent knees implore his en emy to put him to death 
rather than humiliate him or make him do things unb ecoming the dignity of a 
human being. As the poet has sung: ‘The way of the Lord is meant for heroes, 
not for cowards.’ 
It is this fundamental misconception about the natu re and the scope of ahimsa, 
this confusion about the relative values, that is r esponsible for our mistaking 
mere non-killing for ahimsa and for the fearful amo unt of himsa that goes on in 
the name of ahimsa in our country.      MT, II, 421-23  
 
Truth to me is infinitely dearer than the ‘mahatmas hip’, which is purely a 
burden. It is my knowledge of my limitations and my  nothingness which has so 
far saved me from the oppressiveness of ‘mahatmashi p’. I am painfully aware 
of the fact that my desire to continue life in the body involves me in constant 
himsa, that is why I am becoming growingly indiffer ent to this physical body of 
mine. For instance, I know that in the act of respi ration I destroy innumerable 
invisible germs floating in the air. But I do not s top breathing. The consumption 
of vegetables involves himsa but I cannot give them  up. Again, there is himsa in 
the use of antiseptics yet I cannot bring myself to  discard the use of 
disinfectants like the kerosene, to rid myself of t he mosquito pest and the like. 
I suffer snakes to be killed in the ashram when it is impossible to catch and put 
them out of harm’s way. I even tolerate the use of the stick to drive the 
bullocks in the ashram. Thus there is no end of him sa which I directly and 
indirectly commit. And now I find myself confronted  with this monkey problem. Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 49  Let me assure the reader that I am in no hurry to t ake the extreme step of 
killing them. In fact I am not sure that I would at  all be able finally to make up 
my mind to kill them. But I cannot promise that I s hall never kill the monkeys 
even though they may destroy all the crop in the as hram. If as a result of this 
confession of mine, friends choose to give me up as  lost I would be sorry, but 
nothing will induce me to try to conceal my imperfe ctions in the practice of 
ahimsa. All I claim for myself is that I am ceasele ssly trying to understand the 
implications of great ideals like ahimsa and to pra ctice them in thought, word 
and deed and that not without a certain measure of success, as I think. But I 
know that I have a long distance yet to cover in th is direction.    MT, II, 425-26  
 
I am a poor mendicant. My earthly possessions consi st of six spinning wheels, 
prison dishes, a can of goat’s milk, six homespun l oin-cloths and towels, and 
my reputation which cannot be worth much. 5    MT, III, 142  
 
When I found myself drawn into the political coil, I asked myself what was 
necessary for me, in order to remain untouched by i mmorality, by untruth, by 
what is known as political gain. I came definitely to the conclusion that, if I 
had to serve the people in whose midst my life was cast and of whose 
difficulties I was a witness from day to day, I mus t discard all wealth, all 
possession. 
I cannot tell you with truth that, when this belief  came to me, I discarded 
everything immediately. I must confess to you that progress at first was slow. 
And now, as I recall those days of struggle, I reme mber that it was also painful 
in the beginning. But, as days went by, I saw that I had to throw overboard 
many other things which I used to consider as mine,  and a time came when it 
became a matter of positive joy to give up those th ings. One after another 
then, by almost geometric progression, things slipp ed away from me. And, as I 
am describing my experiences, I can say a great bur den fell off my shoulders 
and I felt that I could now walk with ease and, do my work also in the service Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 50  of my fellow men with great comfort and still great er joy. The possession of 
anything then became a troublesome thing and a burd en. 
Exploring the cause of that joy, I found that if I kept anything as my own, I had 
to defend it against the whole world. I found that there were many people who 
did not have the thing, although they wanted it; an d I would have to seek the 
police assistance also if some hungry famine-strick en people, finding me in a 
lonely place, wanted not only to divide the thing w ith me but to dispossess me. 
And I said to myself: if they want it and would tak e it, they do so not from any 
malicious motive, but they would do it because thei rs was a greater need than 
mine. 
And I said to myself: possession seems to me to be a crime; I can only possess 
certain things when I know that others, who also wa nt to possess similar things 
are able to do so. But we know–every one of us can speak from experience-that 
such a thing is an impossibility. Therefore, the on ly thing that can be possessed 
by all is non-possession, not to have anything what soever. Or, in other words, a 
willing surrender….Therefore, having that absolute conviction in me, such must 
be my constant desire that this body also may be su rrendered at the will of 
God, and while it is at my disposal, must be used n ot for dissipation, not for 
self-indulgence, not for pleasure, but merely for s ervice the whole of your 
waking hours. And if this is true with reference to  the body, how much more 
with reference to clothing and other things that we  use? 
And those who have followed out this vow of volunta ry poverty to the fullest 
extent possible-to reach absolute perfection is an impossibility, but the fullest 
possible for a human being-those who have reached t he ideal of that state, 
testify that when you dispossess yourself of everyt hing you have, you really 
possess all the treasures of the world. 6     MT, III, 155-57  
 
From my youth upward I learnt the art of estimating  the value of scriptures on 
the basis of their ethical teaching. Miracles had n o interest for me. The 
miracles said to have been performed by Jesus, even  if I had believed them 
literally, would not have reconciled me to any teac hing that did not satisfy Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 51  universal ethics. Somehow, words of religious teach ers have for me, as I 
presume for the millions, a living force which the same words uttered by 
ordinary mortals do not possess. 
Jesus, to me, is a great world teacher among others . He was to the devotees of 
his generation no doubt ‘the only begotten son of G od’. Their belief need not 
be mine. He affects my life no less because I regar d him as one among the 
many begotten sons of God. The adjective ‘begotten’  has a deeper and possibly 
a grander meaning than its spiritual birth. In his own times he was the nearest 
to God. 
Jesus atoned for the sins of those who accepted his  teachings, by being an 
infallible example to them. But the example was wor th nothing to those who 
never troubled to change their own lives. A regener ate outgrows the original 
taint, even as purified gold outgrows the original alloy. 
I have made the frankest admission of many sins. Bu t I do not carry their 
burden on my shoulders. If I am journeying godward,  as I feel I am, it is safe 
with me. For I feel the warmth of the sunshine of H is presence. My austerities, 
fastings and prayers are, I know, of no value, if I  rely upon them for reforming 
me. But they have an inestimable value, if they rep resent, as I hope they do, 
the yearnings of a soul, striving to lay his weary head in the lap of the 
Maker.    MT, IV, 93  
 
An English friend has been at me for the past thirt y years trying to persuade me 
that there is nothing but damnation in Hinduism and  I must accept Christianity. 
When I was in jail I got from separate sources no l ess than three copies of Life 
of Sister Therese, in the hope that I should follow  her example and accept 
Jesus as the only begotten son of God and my Saviou r. I read the book 
prayerfully but I could not accept even St.Therese’ s testimony. I must say I 
have an open mind, if indeed at this stage and age of my life I can be said to 
have an open mind on this question. Anyway, I claim  to have an open mind in 
this sense that if things were to happen to me as t hey did to Saul before he 
became Paul, I should not hesitate to be converted.  But today I rebel against Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 52  orthodox Christianity, as I am convinced that it ha s distorted the message of 
Jesus. He was an Asiatic whose message was delivere d through many media and 
when it had the backing of a Roman emperor, it beca me an imperialist faith as 
it remains to this day. Of course, there are noble but rare exceptions, but the 
general trend is as I have indicated.     MT, IV, 95  
 
My mind is narrow. I have not read much literature.  I have not seen much of 
the world. I have concentrated upon certain things in life and beyond that I 
have no other interest.      MT, VI, 356  
 
I have not the shadow of a doubt that any man or wo man can achieve, what I 
have, if he or she would make the same effort and c ultivate the same hope and 
faith.    SB, 216  
 
I fancy I know the art of living and dying non-viol ently. But I have yet to 
demonstrate it by one perfect act.      MGP, II, 475  
 
There is no such thing as ‘Gandhism’ and I do not w ant to leave any sect after 
me. I do not claim to have originated any new princ iple or doctrine. I have 
simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal tru ths to our daily life and 
problems. There is, therefore, no question of my le aving any code like the code 
of Manu. There can be no comparison between that gr eat law-giver and me. 
The opinions I have formed and the conclusions I ha ve arrived at are not final, I 
may change them tomorrow. I have nothing new to tea ch the world. Truth and 
Non-violence are as old as the hills. All I have do ne is to try experiments in 
both on as vast a scale as I could do. In doing so,  I have sometimes erred and 
learnt by my errors. Life and its problems have thu s become to me so many 
experiments in the practice of truth and non-violen ce. By instinct, I have been 
truthful, but not non-violent. As a Jain muni once rightly said, I was not so 
much a votary of ahimsa, as I was of truth, and I p ut the latter in the first 
place and the former in the second. For, as he put it, I was capable of Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 53  sacrificing non-violence for the sake of truth. In fact, it was in course of my 
pursuit of truth that I discovered non-violence. Ou r scriptures have declared 
that there is no dharma higher than truth. But non- violence, they say, is the 
highest duty. The word dharma, in my opinion, has d ifferent connotations as 
used in the two aphorisms. 
Well, all my philosophy, if it may be called by tha t pretentious name, is 
contained in what I have said. But, you will not ca ll it ‘Gandhism’; there is no 
‘ism’ about it. And no elaborate literature or prop aganda is needed about it. 
The scriptures have been quoted against my position , but I have held faster 
than ever to the position that truth may not be sac rificed for anything 
whatsoever. Those who believe in the simple truths I have laid down can 
propagate them only by living them. People have lau ghed at my spinning 
wheel, and an acute critic observed that when I die d the wheels would serve to 
make the funeral pyre. That, however, has not shake n my faith in the spinning 
wheel. How am I to convince the world by means of b ooks that the whole of my 
constructive programme is rooted in non-violence? M y life alone can 
demonstrate it.      MT, IV, 66-67  
 
You have given me a teacher in Thoreau, who furnish ed me through his essay 
on the ‘Duty of Civil Disobedience’ scientific conf irmation of what I was doing 
in South Africa. Great Britain gave me Ruskin, whos e Unto This Last 
transformed me overnight from a lawyer and city dwe ller into a rustic living 
away from Durban on a farm, three miles from the ne arest railway station; and 
Russia gave me in Tolstoy a teacher who furnished a  reasoned basis for my non-
violence. Tolstoy blessed my movement in South Afri ca when it was still in its 
infancy and of whose wonderful possibilities I had yet to learn. It was he who 
had prophesied in his letter to me that I was leadi ng a movement which was 
destined to bring a message of hope to the down-tro dden people of the earth. 
So you will see that I have not approached the pres ent task in any spirit of 
enmity to Great Britain and the West. After having imbibed and assimilated the 
message of Unto This Last, I could not be guilty of  approving fascism or nazism, 
whose cult is suppression of the individual and his  liberty.      MT, IV, 177  Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 54   
I have no secrets of my own in this life. I have ow ned my weaknesses. If I were 
sensually inclined, I would have the courage to mak e the confession. It was 
when I developed detestation of the sensual connexi on even with my own wife 
and had sufficiently tested myself that I took the vow of brahmacharya in 1906, 
and that for the sake of better dedication to the s ervice of the country. From 
that day, began my open life….And from that day whe n I began brahmacharya, 
our freedom began. My wife became a free woman, fre e from my authority as 
her lord and master, and I became free from my slav ery to my own appetite 
which she had to satisfy. No other woman had any at traction for me in the 
same sense that my wife had. I was too loyal to her  as husband and too loyal to 
the vow I had taken before my mother to be slave to  any other woman. But the 
manner in which my brahmacharya came to me irresist ibly drew me to woman 
as the mother of man….My brahmacharya knew nothing of the orthodox laws 
governing its observance. I framed my own rules as occasion necessitated. But I 
have never believed that all contact with woman was  to be shunned for the 
due observance of brahmacharya. That restraint whic h demands abstention 
from all contact, no matter how innocent, with the opposite sex is a forced 
growth, having little or no vital value. Therefore,  the natural contacts for 
service were never restrained. And I found myself e njoying the confidence of 
my sisters, European and Indian, in South Africa. A nd when I invited the Indian 
sisters in South Africa to join the civil resistanc e movement, I found myself one 
of them. I discovered that I was specially fitted t o serve the womankind. To cut 
the-for me enthralling-story short, my return to In dia found me in no time one 
with India’s women. The easy access I had to their hearts was an agreeable 
revelation to me. Muslim sisters never kept purdah before me here, even as 
they did not in South Africa. I sleep in the ashram  surrounded by women, for 
they feel safe with me in every respect. It should be remembered that there is 
no privacy in the Segaon Ashram. 
If I were sexually attracted towards women, I have courage enough, even at 
this time of life, to become a polygamist. I do not  believe in free love-secret or Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 55  open. Free open love I have looked upon as dog’s lo ve. Secret love is besides 
cowardly.      MT, V, 241-42  
 
‘You have failed to take even your son with you,’ w rote a correspondent. ‘May 
it not, therefore, be well for you to rest content with putting your own house 
in order?’ 
This may be taken to be a taunt, but I do not take it so. For the question had 
occurred to me, before it did to anyone else. I am a believer in previous births 
and rebirths. All our relationships are the result of the samskaras we carry from 
our previous births. God’s laws are inscrutable and  are the subject of endless 
search. No one will fathom them. 
This is how I regard the case of my son. I regard t he birth of a bad son to me as 
the result of my evil past, whether of this life or  previous. My first son was 
born, when I was in a state of infatuation. Besides , he grew up whilst I was 
myself growing and whilst I knew myself very little . I do not claim to know 
myself fully even today, but I certainly know mysel f better than I did then. For 
years he remained away from me, and his upbringing was not entirely in my 
hands. That is why, he has always been at a loose e nd. His grievance against 
me has always been that I sacrificed him and his br others at the altar of what I 
wrongly believed to be the public good. My other so ns have laid more or less 
the same blame at my door, but with a good deal of hesitation, and they have 
generously forgiven me. My eldest son was the direc t victim of experiments-
radical changes in my life-and so he cannot forget what he regards as my 
blunders. Under the circumstances I believe I am my self the cause of the loss 
of my son, and have, therefore, learnt patiently to  bear it. And yet, it is not 
quite correct to say that I have lost him. For it i s my constant prayer that God 
may make him see the error of his ways and forgive me my shortcomings, if 
any, in serving him. It is my firm faith that man i s by nature going higher, and 
so I have not at all lost the hope that, some day, he will wake up from his 
slumber and ignorance. Thus, he is part of my field  of experiments in  
non-violence. When or whether I shall succeed, I ha ve never bothered to know. Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 56  It is enough for my satisfaction that I do not slac ken my efforts in doing what I 
know to be my duty.  MT, V, 378-79  
 
I read a newspaper cutting sent by a correspondent to the effect that a temple 
has been erected where my image is being worshipped . This I consider to be a 
gross form of idolatry. The person who has erected the temple has wasted his 
resources by misusing them, the villagers who are d rawn there are misled, and 
I am being insulted in that the whole of my life ha s been caricatured in that 
temple. The meaning that I have given to worship is  distorted. The worship of 
the charkha lies in plying it for a living, or as a  sacrifice for ushering in swaraj. 
Gita is worshipped not by a parrot-like recitation but by following its teaching. 
Recitation is good and proper only as an aid to act ion according to its teaching. 
A man is worshipped only to the extent that he is f ollowed not in his 
weaknesses, but in his strength. Hinduism is degrad ed when it is brought down 
to the level of the worship of the image of a livin g being. No man can be said 
to be good before his death. After death too, he is  good for the person who 
believes him to have possessed certain qualities at tributed to him. As a matter 
of fact, God alone knows a man’s heart. And hence, the safest thing is not to 
worship any person, living or dead, but to worship perfection which resides 
only in God, known as Truth. The question then cert ainly arises, as to whether 
possession of photographs is not a form of worship,  carying no merit with it. I 
have said as much before now in my writings. Nevert heless, I have tolerated 
the practice, as it has become an innocent though a  costly fashion. But this 
toleration will become ludicrous and harmful, if I were to give directly or 
indirectly the slightest encouragement to the pract ice above described. It 
would be a welcome relief, if the owner of the temp le removed the image and 
converted the building into a spinning centre, wher e the poor will card and 
spin for wages, and the others for sacrifice and al l will be wearers of khaddar. 
This will be the teaching of the Gita in action, an d true worship of it and 
me.     MT, VII, 100  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 57  My imperfection and failures are as much a blessing  from God as my success 
and my talents, and I lay them both at His feet. Wh y should He have chosen 
me, an imperfect instrument, for such a mighty expe riment? I think He 
deliberately did so. He had to serve the poor dumb ignorant millions. A perfect 
man might have been their despair. When they found that one with their 
failings was marching on towards ahimsa, they too h ad confidence in their own 
capacity. We should not have recognized a perfect m an if he had come as our 
leader, and we might have driven him to a cave. May  be he who follows me will 
be more perfect and you will be able to receive his  message.  MGP, II, 801  
 
I did not move a muscle, when I first I first heard  that an atom bomb had wiped 
out Hiroshima. On the contrary I said to myself, ‘U nless now the world adopts 
non-violence, it will spell certain suicide for man kind.’   MGP, II, 808  
 
I do not sit in judgement upon the world for its ma ny misdeeds. Being 
imperfect myself and needing toleration and charity , I tolerate the world’s 
imperfections till I find or create an opportunity for fruitful expostulation.  
MT, I, 285  
 
When I have become incapable of evil and when nothi ng harsh or haughty 
occupies, be it momentarily, my thought-world, then , and not till then, my 
non-violence will move all the hearts of all the wo rld. MGP, II, 800  
 
If one has completely merged oneself with Him, he s hould be content to leave 
good and bad, success and failure to Him and be car eful for nothing. I feel I 
have not attained that state, and, therefore, my st riving is incomplete.  
MGP, II, 453  
 
There is a stage in life when a man does not need e ven to proclaim his thoughts 
much less to show them by outward action. Mere thou ghts act. They attain that Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 58  power. Then it can be said of him that his seeming inaction constitutes his 
action…. My striving is in that direction.      MGP, II, 463  
 
I would love to attempt an answer to a question whi ch has been addressed to 
me from more than one quarter of the globe. It is: How can you account for the 
growing violence among your own people on the part of political parties for the 
furtherance of political ends? Is this the result o f the thirty years of non-violent 
practice for ending the British rule? Does your mes sage of non-violence still 
hold good for the world? I have condensed the senti ments of my correspondents 
in my own language. 
In reply I must confess my bankruptcy, not that of non-violence. I have already 
said that the non-violence that was offered during the past thirty years was 
that of the weak. Whether it is good enough answer or not is for the others to 
judge. It must be further admitted that such non-vi olence can have no play in 
the altered circumstances. India has no experience of the non-violence of the 
strong. It serves no purpose for me to continue to repeat that non-violence of 
the strong is the strongest force in the world. The  truth requires constant and 
extensive demonstration. This I am now endeavouring  to do to the best of my 
ability. What if the best of my ability is very lit tle? May I not be living in a 
fool’s paradise? Why should I ask the people to fol low me in the fruitless 
search? These are pertinent questions. My answer is  quite simple. I ask nobody 
to follow me. Everyone should follow his or her own  inner voice. If he or she 
has no ears to listen to it, he or she should do th e best he or she can. In no 
case, should he or she imitate others sheeplike. 
One more question has been and is being asked. If y ou are certain that India is 
going the wrong way, why do you associate with the wrong doers? Why do you 
not plough your own lonely furrow and have faith th at if you are right, your 
erstwhile friends and your followers will seek you out? I regard this as a very 
fair question. I must not attempt to argue against it. All I can say is that my 
faith is as strong as ever. It is quite possible th at my technique is faulty. There 
are old and tried precedents to guide one in such a  complexity. Only, no one Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 59  should act mechanically. Hence, I can say to all my  counselors that they should 
have patience with me and even share my belief that  there is no hope for the 
aching world except through the narrow and straight  path of non-violence. 
Millions like me may fail to prove the truth in the ir own lives, that would be 
their failure, never of the eternal law.      MT, VIII, 22-23  
 
The partition has come in spite of me. It has hurt me. But it is the way in which 
the partition has come that has hurt me more. I hav e pledged myself to do or 
die in the attempt to put down the present conflagr ation. I love all mankind as 
I love my own countrymen, because God dwells in the  heart of every human 
being, and I aspire to realize the highest in life through the service of 
humanity. It is true that the non-violence that we practiced was the non-
violence of the weak, i.e., no non-violence at all.  But I maintain that this was 
not what I presented to my countrymen. Nor did I pr esent to them weapon of 
non-violence because they were weak or disarmed or without military training, 
but because my study of history has taught me that hatred and violence used in 
howsoever noble a cause only breed their kind and i nstead of bringing peace 
jeopardize it. Thanks to the tradition of our ancie nt seers, sages and saints, if 
there is a heritage that India can share with the w orld, it is this gospel of 
forgiveness and faith which is her proud possession . I have faith that in time to 
come, India will pit that against the threat of des truction which the world has 
invited upon itself by the discovery of the atom bo mb. The weapon of truth 
and love is infallible, but there is something wron g in us, its votaries, which has 
plunged us into the present suicidal strife. I am, therefore, trying to examine 
myself.      MGP, II, 246  
 
I have passed through many an ordeal in my life. Bu t perhaps this is to be the 
hardest. I like it. The fiercer it becomes, the clo ser is the communion with God 
that I experience and the deeper grows my faith in His abundant grace. So long 
as it persists, I know it is well with me.      MGP, II, 246  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 60  If I were a perfect man, I own, I should not feel t he miseries of neighbours as I 
do. As a perfect man I should take note of them, pr escribe a remedy, and 
compel adoption by the force of unchallengeable Tru th in me. But as yet I only 
see as through a glass darkly and therefore have to  carry conviction by slow 
and laborious processes, and then, too, not always with success….I would be 
less human if, with all my knowledge of the avoidab le misery pervading the 
land…I did not feel with and for all the suffering of the dumb millions of 
India.     MGP, II, 324  
 
I want to declare to the world that, whatever may b e said to the contrary, and 
although I might have forfeited the regard and even  the trust of many in the 
West-and I bow my head low-but even for their frien dship or their love, I must 
not suppress that voice within, call it conscience,  call it prompting of my inner 
basic nature. There is something within me impellin g me to cry out my agony. I 
have known exactly what it is. That something in me  which never deceives me 
tells me now: ‘You have to stand against the whole world although you may 
have to stand alone. You have to stare the world in  the face although the world 
may look at you with bloodshot eyes. Do not fear. T rust that little thing in you 
which resides in the heart and says: Forsake friend s, wife, all; but testify to 
that for which you have lived and for which you hav e to die.’      MM, 16  
 
My soul refuses to be satisfied so long as it is a helpless witness of a single 
wrong or a single misery. But it is not possible fo r me, a weak, frail, miserable 
being, to mend every wrong or to hold myself free o f blame for all the wrong I 
see. The spirit in me pulls one way, the flesh in m e pulls in the opposite 
direction. There is freedom from the action of thes e two forces but that 
freedom is attainable only by slow and painful stag es. I cannot attain freedom 
by a mechanical refusal to act, but only by intelli gent action in a detached 
manner. This struggle resolves itself into an inces sant crucifixion of the flesh so 
that the spirit may become entirely free.     MGP, II, 324  
 Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 61  I believe in the message of truth delivered by all the religious teachers of the 
world. And it is my constant prayer that I may neve r have a feeling of anger 
against my traducers, that even if I fall a victim to an assassin’s bullet, I may 
deliver up my soul with the remembrance of God upon  my lips. I shall be 
content to be written down an imposter if my lips u tter a word of anger or 
abuse against my assailant at the last moment.      MGP, II, 101  
 
Have I that non-violence of the brave in me? My dea th alone will show that. If 
someone killed me and I died with prayer for the as sassin on my lips, and God’s 
remembrance and consciousness of His living presenc e in the sanctuary of my 
heart, then alone would I be said to have had the n on-violence of the 
brave.      MGP, II,327  
 
I do not want to die…of a creeping paralysis of my faculties – a defeated man. 
An assassin’s bullet may put an end to my life. I w ould welcome it. But I would 
love, above all, to fade out doing my duty with my last breath.      MGP, I, 562  
 
I am not aching for martyrdom, but if it comes in m y way in the prosecution of 
what I consider to be the supreme duty in defence o f the faith I hold…I shall 
have earned it.      MM, 9  
 
Assaults have been made on my life in the past, but  God has spared me till 
now, and the assailants have repented for their act ion. But if someone were to 
shoot me in the belief that he was getting rid of a  rascal, he would kill not the 
real Gandhi, but the one that appeared to him a ras cal.      MM, 9  
 
If I die of a lingering illness, nay even by as muc h as a boil or a pimple, it will 
be your duty to proclaim to the world, even at the risk of making people angry 
with you, that I was not the man of God that I clai med to be. If you do that it 
will give my spirit peace. Note down this also that  if someone were to end my 
life by putting a bullet through me – as someone tr ied to do with a bomb the Gandhi’s Life in his own words 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 62  other day – and I met his bullet without a groan, a nd breathed my last taking 
God’s name, then alone would I have made good my cl aim. 7      MGP, II, 766  
 
If anybody tried to take out my body in a processio n after I died, I would 
certainly tell them – if my corpse could speak – to  spare me and cremate me 
where I had died.      MGP, II, 417  
 
After I am gone, no single person will be able comp letely to represent me. But 
a little bit of me will live in many of you. If eac h puts the cause first and 
himself last, the vacuum will to a large extent be filled.   MGP, II, 782  
 
I do not want to be reborn. But if I have to be reb orn, I should be born an 
untouchable, so that I may share their sorrows, suf ferings, and affronts levelled 
at them, in order that I may endeavour to free myse lf and them from that 
miserable condition.      SB, 238

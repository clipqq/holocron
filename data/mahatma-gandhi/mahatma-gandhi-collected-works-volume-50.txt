MY DEAR ANAND,
I have your delightful letter. You do not tell me how you fared
physically. I have already written to you. I am glad Vidya is with you
and has seen a little of the Ashram life. Tell me how you are in mind
and body.
Love.

medicine given by the doctor, write to me and tell me what effect it
has. If the latter has taken a pledge to join the struggle, I think she

do as your hearts bid you.

5. LETTER TO MIRABEHN
YERAVDA MANDIR,
August 24, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
I have your love letter written during your journey to Madras. I
am hoping that this strain will not prove too much for you. Your
descriptions are all valuable. Yes, I had a strenuous time during the
Nehrus’ visit. It was with difficulty that I was able to spin 375 rounds
without doing which I should feel most unhappy. The box wheel is
working very well and undoubtedly causes less strain. It gives more
satisfactory work now that I have put on it the thin mal you sent me.
The thick mal was causing trouble. The carding-bow is working to
perfection. It imposes no strain on me. Kakasaheb rolls the slivers. He
has yet to learn carding which he proposes to begin shortly. The
translation of the bhajans continues as before regularly but slowlyVOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 3and I see no immediate chance of greater output. I am keeping well.
The weight fluctuates. Last week I regained one pound out of two or
three I seemed to have lost. There has been no loss of energy. The
water here is hard and therefore constipation requires a little handling.
Love.

You seem to have dried up? Is it out of compassion for me or

me. How is Sita? Why does she fall ill so often? I hope you are not
being miserly about fruit. What is the condition of your ears? How do
you keep generally? How is Tara? How is Nanabhai’s health? Think
about other similar questions yourself. I hope you, always find
Manilal with a smile on his face and joking. Does he read anything in

I have preserved your last letter. I did  not reply to it. But after
reading about your heroism I cannot help writing. Deal patiently with
the situation. I would advise you not to do anything on an impulse.
Does it need mentioning that pure sacrifice calls for careful thought, a
sense of discrimination, restraint and patience? Since Khurshedbehn
was with you, I felt reassured and satisfied.
Blessings from both of us.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
August 24/26, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
This time I got the letters earlier than usual, that is, on
Wednesday instead of on Thursday. Among the letters is one for Satis
Babu. He  is  Krishnadas’s  guru, Satis Mukherjee. His address is
Harra Road, Calcutta. I have forgotten the number of the flat. You will
find  it  somewhere in my papers. Surendra is likely to know it. Or
you will get it in the Ashram office itself. How is Devdas’s health?
Tell him that I often think of him. Has Ramdas’s health recovered? I
have before now asked for the names of those who have been
released. It would be better if against each name the quantity of
carding and spinning done by the person is also mentioned. If, when
you do not get a cloth-lined envelope, the ordinary envelope is tightly
secured by a string, like a packet sent as book post, there will be no
risk afterwards. Keshu seems to have lost health again.Take immediate
and effective measures to help him to recover. Giriraj’s illness has
lasted quite long. His blood must be impure. I have not received the
guide to Singer’s. If you find it difficult to secure a copy, give up the
attempt. I understand what you write about Hasmukhrai. Give him the
letters if and when you think you may. Read the letter to Zaulinger
before giving it to her. Hence I don’t write about her in this letter.
You must have sent an acknowledgment to Dhangopal. How is
Jamnadas? Do the authorities let you visit him occasionally?
Tuesday morning, August 26, 1930
Non-possession is allied to non-stealing. A thing not originally
stolen must nevertheless be classified as stolen property if we possess it
without needing it. Possession implies provision for the future. A
seeker after truth, a follower of the law of love, cannot hold anything
against tomorrow. God never stores for the morrow; He never creates
more than what is strictly needed for the moment. If, therefore, we
repose faith in His providence, we should be assured that He will give
us every day our daily bread, meaning everything we require. Saints
and men of faith have always found justification for it from their
experience. Our ignorance or negligence of the Divine Law, which
gives to man from day to day his daily bread and no more, has given6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIrise to inequalities with all the miseries attendant upon them. The rich
have a superfluous store of things which they do not need, and which
are therefore neglected and wasted; while millions starve to death for
want of sustenance. If each retained possession only of what he
needed, no one would be in want and all would live in contentment.
As it is, the rich are discontented no less than the poor. The poor man
would fain become a millionaire, and the millionaire a
multi-millionaire. The poor are not content if they get their daily
needs. They  have  a right, however, to get enough for their daily
needs  and  it  is  the  duty  of society to help them to satisfy them.
The rich should take the initiative in dispossession with a view to
universal diffusion of the spirit of contentment. If only they keep
their own property within moderate limits, the starving will be easily
fed and will learn the lesson of contentment along with the rich.
Perfect fulfilment of the ideal of non-possession requires that man
should, like the birds, have no roof over his head, no clothing and no
stock of food for the morrow. He will indeed need his daily bread, but
it will  be God’s business, and not his, to provide it. Only very very
few,  if  any at all, can reach this ideal. We ordinary seekers may not
be  repelled  by  the  seeming impossibility. But we must keep the
ideal constantly before us, and in the light thereof critically examine
our  possessions  and  try  to reduce them. Civilization, in the real
sense of the term, consists not in the multiplication, but in the
deliberate and voluntary  reduction  of wants. This alone promotes
real happiness and contentment and increases the capacity for service.
Judging by this criterion, we find that in the Ashram we possess many
things the necessity for which cannot be proved, and we thus tempt
our neighbours to steal. If people try, they can reduce their wants and,
as the latter diminish, they become happier, more peaceful and
healthier. From the standpoint of pure truth, the body, too, is a
possession. It has been truly said that desire for enjoyment creates
bodies for the soul and sustains them. When this desire vanishes, there
remains no further need for the body and man is free from the vicious
cycle of births and deaths. The soul is omnipresent; why should she
care to be confined within the cage-like body, or do evil and even kill
for the sake of that cage? We thus arrive at the ideal of total
renunciation and learn the use of the body for the purposes of service
so long as it exists, so much so that service, and not bread, becomes
for us the staff of life. We eat and drink, sleep and wake, for serviceVOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 7alone. Such an attitude of mind brings us real happiness and the
beatific vision in the fulness of time. Let us all examine ourselves
from this standpoint.
We should remember that non-possession is a principle
applicable to thoughts as well as to things. A man who fills his brain
with useless knowledge violates that inestimable principle. Thoughts
which turn us away from God or do not turn us towards Him are
unnecessary possessions and constitute impediments in our way. In
this connection we may consider the definition of knowledge
contained in Chapter XIII of the Gita. We are there told that humility,
amanitvam, etc., constitute knowledge and that all the rest is
ignorance. If this is true—and there is no doubt that it is true—much
that we hug today as knowledge is ignorance pure and simple, and
therefore only does us harm instead of conferring any benefit. It
makes the mind wander and even reduces it to a vacuity, and
discontent flourishes in endless ramifications of evil. Needless to say,
this is not a plea for inertia. Every moment of our life should be filled
with mental or physical activity, but that activity should be sattvik,
tending towards truth. One who has consecrated his-life to service
cannot be idle for a single moment. But we have to learn to
distinguish between good activity and evil activity. This discernment
goes naturally with a single-minded devotion to service.

Kakasaheb’s weight has again increased by one pound, and his

I had lost. For the past three days, I have been taking boiled

YERAVDA MANDIR,
August 29, 1930
CHI. PREMA,
I got your letter. No one should be amused at my writing on
slips of paper or be angry with me for that reason. That is the proper
thing for me to do. Though I write on such slips, I try to make each
letter as interesting as I can in the time I get.
Why are you alarmed by the suspicion that you have got some
disease in your body? What would it matter even if you had a disease
and that too a grave one? “The body may live or perish, what should
endure is one’s devotion to God.’’1 We have learnt at least this in the
Ashram, if nothing more. If you fast for a few days, the body will be
cleansed. You require Kuhne baths, hip-baths and particularly friction
sitz-baths. If you do not know about them, ask Kanta or Radha. I
think they know. You may also read about them in Kuhne’s book.
Whenever women suffer from any disease, it becomes necessary to
know the facts about their monthly periods. Are they normal with
you? Are they regular in appearance and duration? Are they painful?
If necessary, consult a doctor.
I have not read Arvind Babu’s book. I alone know how limited
is my reading. My main interest is in reading the book of nature. I
shall never finish reading it.
You should have enough sleep. You should observe the rule of
sleeping from 9 to 4.

Was there any letter to which I did not reply? I do think every

you had spent a few months with me. However, both of you have so
trained yourselves, though you lived away from me, that I don’t know

YERAVDA MANDIR,

CHI. PRABHUDAS,
I have your letter. Both of us feel that you should take with you
both Dhiru and Rambhau1 if they are willing to go. In each other’s
company, they will stay there longer and you will have less to worry
about. With either Dhiru or Rambhau alone, you will have to go out of
way to give him company. At present, I would not like you to be in
that predicament.
I had forgotten about Damodardas and therefore wrote nothing
about him. I would not have seen any harm if he had come, and you
had accompanied him. But I like the present arrangement more.
I understand what you say about the spinning-wheel. My
argument was altogether different. I appreciate that it does not bother
you. May your faith be rewarded. You have mentioned the right
shlokas. If you have the self-confidence demanded by the shloka, if
you are hard-working and if your idealism is based on reality, you
will certainly find the rest of the means and will also acquire the
required knowledge. So, I have no objection at all if you intend to
persist in your efforts. The only condition is that you are not to do it
at the cost of your health. If your health had reached beyond
recovery stage, I would not have allowed you to go to the hills. This
time you are going with the blessings of Kashi and Chhaganlal. No
doubt blessings from both of us are always with you.

Your letters come quite regularly. If one’s mind indulges in
thoughts of pleasure, one might as well get it done with the body. But
when the mind itself does not want it, it would indeed be better if one
works away at something with concentration. In matters like these,
children cannot be forced to do anything. If you are feeling too lazy
for udyoga1 the feeling can by persistent effort be got out of the
system. You must realize the necessity of work.

immediately take remedial measures. When the date is due it would
help if you took a steam-bath once or twice. I think Radhabehn knows
how it is done. They follow your suggestions in making the bread

CHI. MIRA,
Your letter though written in a shaky train was wonderfully
legible. If you had not drawn my attention, I should not have noticed
any difference at all.
I think I have got my control over the travelling wheel and I
hope to gain greater speed than now. As it is I am saving about an
hour and there is much less fatigue. But your labour has not gone in
vain. Kakasaheb was using the Gandiv. But it did not give him
satisfaction. And he was not able always even to do one unit, i.e., 160
rounds. On your wheel he has no difficulty in making one unit in two
hours which is the least he has vowed to give to the charkha.
You did the right thing in transferring to the 2nd class. There
can be no harm and certainly no shame in going 2nd class, when the
3rd is clearly impossible or next to it.
I am glad you had a quiet 36 hours with Miss Petersen. Is not

CHI. PRABHAVATI,
You are too greedy. However long my letter, you will think it
too short. I send between 50 and 60 letters to the Ashram every week,
and I must write them during whatever time I can spare from
spinning. Hence, and also because I don’t have much to write about
from here every time, I write short letters in which, however, I say all
that I wish to say. If I had to write only one or two letters, I could fill
them with long description of conditions here. The letter meant for
the whole Ashram is always long. Since Mirabehn cannot read
Gujarati, I write a long letter to her. All other letters are short and to
the point. Look; I have filled half this letter explaining why I write
short letters. Kakasaheb and I were weighed on Friday; my weight
came to 104 and Kakasaheb’s to 114. This is a fairly good increase.
We pray regularlyevery day. The  Gita is also read daily. Recently I
have given up raisins and dates and, instead, eat boiled vegetables.
Generally I eat sweet potatoes and uncooked tomatoes every day or
some other vegetable like cabbage. This diet has done me no harm.
The weight has increased and constipation has been relieved. You
must have read the reports about the negotiations with the
Government. There was no truth in them at all. Let me know your
future programme, and also Jayaprakash’s. Has your mother-in-law
recovered now? I am sure you will nurse her with the utmost love.

BHAISHRI VALJI,
I got your letter. If it is only your gums which bleed, you
should gargle with salt water three or four times a day and in the
morning massage them with a finger using pure, finely-powdered salt,
taking care not to spit out the saliva meanwhile. You may use coconut
oil instead of salt. You should also gargle with some potassium
permanganate solution . If the bleeding does not stop  with this, you
should consult a dentist. Sometimes such bleeding is brought about
even by indigestion. You should eat daily a little quantity of
uncooked green vegetables.
Were you forced to eat rotlas of bajra and jowar or did you eat

refusing to take advantage of the shade even when sitting under a
green tree. I should like to get, if available, an account of the carding
and spinning done by everyone.

[September 2, 1930 ]1
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got the Ashram packet on Thursday. If you get the discourses
printed, send one or two copies here. It would help if I had with me a
copy of the previous discourse. Send me also the set of Ashram rules.
If Surendra, Madhavji and Madhavlal have still not written to me, ask
them to write. Others, too, should write. Kusum’s hand must be all
right. Has Mrs. Zaulinger calmed down a little? Try to win her over.
I remember to have written to someone and given permission
for a translation of the Autobiography in Swedish. Accept the sum of
£11 and credit it in whichever account you think proper.
You utilized the occasion of Rakshabandhan very well. Take
care of Lilavati. If she gets fainting fits, she should come over to the
Ashram and rest. If you come to know Devdas’s weight, mention it in
your letter. In that place he should improve. You can get a garland
made from yarn spun by Jamnalalji. The spinning-wheel gives me no
difficulty now. The speed has not increased much, but it is good
enough. This is a portable spinning-wheel and it required a thin mal.
If anyone knows a simple method of making a mal, he should write to
me. Abbas had explained it to me, but I have forgotten it. One packet
of cotton has been exhausted. Together with what I can make from
the second one, I shall have enough slivers to last a month. But
someone is bound to visit Kakasaheb. Send one packet with him.
Vallabhbhai, too, has a visitor once a week or fortnight. You may send
the packet with one of the persons. If neither course is possible, send
some cotton by post as you did previously. There is no hurry at all.
Along with it, send some pieces of leather for repairing the heels of
my sandals. If no such pieces are available and if you can find my
pair of sandals, send that. There was an extra pair during the march.
Kanti will probably know about it. There was one in the Ashram too.
Kusum may know about it, or the person to whom she has handed
over charge of these things.
1 As in the printed source.20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIFEARLESSNESS . As every reader of the Gita knows fearlessness
heads the list of the divine attributes enumerated in Chapter XVI.
Whether this is merely due to the exigencies of metre or whether the
pride of place has been deliberately yielded to fearlessness, is more
than I can say. In my opinion, however, fearlessness richly deserves
the first rank assigned to it. For it is indispensable for the growth of
the other noble qualities. How can one seek Truth or cherish love
without fearlessness? As Pritam says:  “The path of Hari is the path of
the brave, not of cowards.” Hari here means Truth. And the brave are
those armed with fearlessness, not with the sword, the rifle and the like.
These are taken up only by those who are possessed by fear.
Fearlessness connotes freedom from all external fear, fear of
disease, bodily injury and death, of dispossession, of losing one’s
nearest and dearest, of losing reputation or giving offence, and so on.
One who overcomes the fear of death does not surmount all other
fears, as is commonly but erroneously supposed. Some of us do
notfear death, but flee from the minor ills of life. Some are ready to
die themselves, but cannot bear their loved ones being taken away
from them. Some misers will put up with all this, will part even with
theirlives, but not their property; others will do any number of black
deeds in order to uphold their supposed prestige. Some will swerve
from the straight and narrow path which lies clear before them, simply
because they are afraid of incurring the world’s odium. The seeker
after Truth must conquer all these fears. He should be ready to
sacrifice his all in the quest of Truth, even as Harishchandra did. The
story of Harishchandra may be only a parable; but every seeker will
bear witness to its truth from his personal experience and, therefore,
that story is as precious as any historical fact.
Perfect fearlessness is almost impossible to cultivate. It can be
attained only by him who has realized the Supreme, as it implies
freedom from delusion. One can always progress towards this goal by
determined and constant endeavour and by cultivating self-confidence
 As I have stated at the very outset, we must give up all external
fears. But the internal foes we must always fear. We are rightly afraid
of animal passion, anger and the like. External fears cease of their
own accord when once we have conquered these traitors within the
camp. All such fears revolve round the body as the centre, and will
therefore disappear as soon as we get rid of attachment for the body.
We thus find that all external fear is the baseless fabric of our ownVOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 21vision. Fear has no place in our hearts when we have shaken off
attachment for wealth, for family and for the body. “Enjoy the things
of the earth by renouncing them’’1 is the sovereign precept. Wealth,
family and the body will be there just the same; we have only to
change our attitude towards them. All these are not ours, but God’s.
Nothing whatever in this world is ours. Even we ourselves are His.
Why then should we entertain any fear? The Upanishad, therefore,
directs us to give up attachment for things while we enjoy them. That
is to say, we must be interested in them not as proprietors but only as
trustees. He on whose behalf we hold them will give us the strength
and the weapons requisite for defending them against all usurpers.
When we thus cease to be masters and reduce ourselves to the rank of
servants, humbler than the very dust under our feet, all fears will roll
away like mists; we shall attain ineffable peace and see Satyanarayana,
the God of Truth, face to face.
Kakasaheb had not so far taken a categorical vow of spinning;
he has done so now. The vow is that he will spin for not less  than two
hours and not less than 160 yards daily. He has also started carding.
He spends most of his time in physical activities. He maintains good
strength. For the last four days or so I have given up raisins and dates
and eat instead boiled vegetables, raw tomatoes, etc. If this122
dietdoes not meet my needs, I shall add fruit. I have made the change
in order to overcome constipation. If the change proves economical,
so much the better. I will not be obstinate about any item.

32. FRAGMENT OF A LETTER
September 3, 1930
We may claim our experiment to have succeeded only if the
Ashram women can swim across even in a storm. We need not worry if
we stumble. Whenever we try to climb, there is always a risk of falling.
We must take that risk. We may not knowingly take such a risk, but we
should not turn back if circumstances force us to take it. We should
learn to adopt towards women the same liberal attitude that we do
towards men. Will not Lord Krishna protect our honour? We sing a
bhajan which says that He will. Let us show that faith in our actions.

M. R. JAYAKAR1
September 5, 1930
DEAR FRIENDS,
We have very carefully gone through the letter, written to you
by H. E. the Viceroy, dated 28-8-1930. You have kindly
supplemented it with a record of your conversations with the Viceroy
on points not covered by the letter. We have equally carefully gone
through the Note signed by Pandit Motilal Nehru, Dr. Syed Mahmud
and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and sent by them  through you. This
note embodies their considered opinion on the said letter and the
conversation.
We gave two anxious nights to these papers and we had the
benefit of a full and free discussion with you on all the points arising
out of these papers. And as we have told you, we have all arrived at the
definite conclusion that we see no meeting ground between the
Government and the Indian National Congress so far as we can speak
for the latter, being out of touch with the outside world. We
unreservedly associate ourselves with the opinion contained in the
Note sent by the distinguished prisoners in the Naini Central Prison,
but these friends expect us to give in our own words our view of the
position finally reached in the negotiations for peace, which you, with
patriotic motives, have carried on during the past two months at
considerable sacrifice of your own time and no less inconvenience to
yourselves. We shall therefore allude as briefly as possible to the
fundamental difficulties that have stood in the way of peace being
achieved.
1 After meeting Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and M. R. Jayakar the Viceroy addressed
a letter to Sapru on August 28,  vide Appendix Viceroy’s letter to Sir T.B. Sapru”,      
28-8-1930. Sapru and Jayakar then met Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr. Syed
Mahmud at Naini Jail on August 30 and 31 and showed them the Viceroy’s letter as
also notes of conversation with him, vide Appendix “Notes of Conversations with
Viceroy’s”, 5-9-1930. The Nehrus then gave them their final note addressed to
Gandhiji, vide Appendix “Note From Nehrus”, 31-8-1930.. With these documents
Sapru and Jayakar saw Gandhiji and other leaders at Yeravda Jail on September 3, 4
and 5. A draft of this Statement available in Gandhiji’s hand in S.N. 1927 bears some
changes and additions in a handwriting other than Gandhiji’s.24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThe Viceroy’s letter, dated July 16, 1930, is, we have taken,
intended to satisfy, so far as may be, the terms of the interview Pandit
Motilal Nehru gave to Mr. George Slocombe on June 20th, and the
statement submitted by Mr. Slocombe to him on June 25, and
approved by him. We are unable to read in the Viceroy’s language in
his letter of July 16 anything like satisfaction of the terms of the
interview or the said statement. Here are the relevant parts of the
interview and the statement.
In the interview it was stated: “If the terms of the Round Table Conference
are to be left open and we are expected to go to London to argue the case for
Dominion Status, I should decline. If it was made clear, however, that the
Conference would meet to frame a constitution for a Free India subject to such
adjustments of our mutual relations as are required by the special needs and
conditions of India and our past association, I for one would be disposed to
recommend to the Congress to accept the invitation to participate in the
Conference. We must be masters in our household, but we are ready to agree to
reasonable terms for the period of transfer of power from a British
administration in India to a responsible Indian Government. The Conference
must be to meet British people to discuss these terms as nation to nation and
on an equal footing.’’1
The statement contained the following:
“The Government would give private assurance that they would support
the demand for full responsible Government for India subject to such mutual
adjustments and terms of transfer as are required by the special needs and
conditions of India and by her long association with Great Britain and as may
be decided by the Round Table Conference.”2
Here is the relevant part of the Viceroy’s letter:
It remains my earnest desire, as it is that of my Government—and I have
no doubt also that of His Majesty’s Government—to do everything we can in
our respective spheres to assist the people of India to obtain as large a degree
of management of their own affairs as can be shown to be consistent with
making provision for those matters in regard to which they are not at present
in a position to assume responsibility. What those matters may be,                
and what provisions may best be made for them, will engage                             
the attention of the Conference, but I have never believed that, with
1 The draft did not have this paragraph.
2 The draft did not have these paragraphs.VOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 25mutual confidence, on both sides, it should be impossible to reach an
agreement.1
We feel that there is a vast difference between the two positions.
Where Pandit Motilalji visualizes a Free India enjoying a status
different in kind from the present as a result of the deliberations of
the proposed Round Table Conference, the Viceroy’s letter merely2
commits him and his Government and the British Cabinet to an
earnest desire3 to assist the people of 4 India to obtain5 as large a
degree of the management of their6 own affairs as can be shown7 to be
consistent with making provision for those matters in regard to which
they are not at present in a position to assume responsibility. In other
words, the prospect held out by the Viceroy’s letter is one of getting,
at the most, something more along the lines of reforms commencing
with those known to us as the Lansdowne Reforms.
As we had the fear that our interpretation was correct in our
letter of 15-8-1930 signed also by Pandit Motilal Nehru, Dr. Syed
Mahmud and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, we put our position negatively
and said what would not in our opinion satisfy the Congress. The
letter you have now brought from H.E. the Viceroy reiterates the
original position taken up by him in his first letter, and, we are grieved
to say, contemptuously dismisses our letter as unworthy of consider-
ation and regards discussion on the basis of the proposals contained in
the letter as impossible.
You have thrown further light on the question by telling us that
“if Mr. Gandhi definitely faced the Government of India with such a
question”, i.e., the right of secession from the Empire at India’s will,
the Viceroy would say, that “they were not prepared to treat it as an
open question”. We, on the other hand regard the question as the
central point in any constitution that India is to secure and one which
ought not to need any argument. If India is now to attain full

3 The draft has “a desire”.
4 The words “the people of ”, not found in The Hindu version , were added in the
draft.
5 The draft has “get”.
6 The draft has “her”.
7 The words following this do not appear in the draft.  Gandhiji simply wrote
“take” indicating that the remaining part of the sentence, quoted from the Viceroy’s
letter, was to be copied here.26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIResponsible Government or full Self-Government or whatever other
term it is to be known by, it can be only on an absolutely voluntary
basis, leaving each party to sever the partnership or association at will.
If India is to remain no longer a part of the Empire but is to become
an equal and free partner in the Commonwealth, she must feel the
want and warmth of that association and never otherwise. You will
please observe this position is clearly brought out in the interview
already alluded to by us. So long, therefore, as the British Government
or the British people regard this position as impossible or untenable,
the Congress must, in our opinion, continue the fight for freedom.
The attitude taken up by the Viceroy over the very mild
proposal made by us regarding the salt tax affords a further painful
insight into the Government’s mentality. It is as plain as daylight to us
that, from the dizzy heights of Simla, the rulers of India are unable to
understand or appreciate the difficulties of the starving millions living
in the plains whose incessant toil makes1 Government from such a
giddy height at all possible.
If the blood of innocent people spilt during the past five months
to sustain the monopoly of a gift of nature2 next in importance to
poor people only to air and water has not brought home to the
Government the conviction of its utter immorality, no Conference of
Indian leaders as suggested by the Viceroy can possibly do so. The
suggestion that those who ask for the repeal of the monopoly should
show a source of equivalent revenue adds insult to injury. This attitude
is an indication that if Government can help it the existing crushingly
- expensive system shall continue to the end of time. We venture
further to point out that not only does the Government here, but
Governments all the world over, openly condone breaches of
measures which have become unpopular but which for technical or
other reasons cannot straightway be repealed.
We need not now deal with many other important matters in
which too there is no adequate3 advance from the Viceroy to the
popular position set forth by us. We hope we have brought out
sufficient weighty matters in which there appears at present to be an
unbridgeable gulf between the British Government and the Congress.
1 The draft here reads: “starving millions living in the plains of India who
make”.
2 The draft has  “substance” which was changed to “gift of nature”.
3 Added in the draftVOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 27There need, however, be no disappointment for the apparent
failure of the peace negotiations. The Congress is engaged in a grim
struggle for freedom. The nation has resorted to a weapon which the
rulers being unused to it will take time to understand and appreciate.
We are not surprised that a few months’ suffering has not converted
them1.
The Congress desires to harm no2 single legitimate interest by
whomsoever acquired. It has no quarrel with Englishmen as such, but
it resents and will resent with all the moral strength at its command the
intolerable British domination. Non-violence being assured to the end,
we are certain of the early fulfilment of the national aspiration. This
we say in spite of the bitter and often insulting language used by the
powers-that-be in regard to Civil Disobedience.
Lastly, we once more thank you for the great pains you have
taken to bring about peace, but we suggest that the time has not arri-
ved when any further peace negotiations should be carried on with
those in charge of the Congress organization. As prisoners, we labour
under an obvious3 handicap. Our opinion is based, as it must be, on
second-hand evidence and runs the risk of being faulty.4 It would be
naturally open to those in charge of the Congress organization to see
any of us.5 In that case, and when the Government itself is equally de-
sirous for peace, they should have no difficulty in having access to us.

CHI. BHAGWANJI,
I have your painful letter.  . . . behn1 appears to be a most sinful
woman. We shall however now win her over by kindness, if we can.
Your dharma is clear. At least for the present you should leave her
company altogether. You should neither serve her nor accept service
from her. I have written a letter to her which Narandas will read to her.
You should read it. A man or a woman susceptible to mutual passion
has no right to accept help from or offer it to each other. You have
ceased to be man and wife, but even when the relationship exists the
husband who is susceptible to carnal desire can never render pure
service to his wife. Know this to have been proved by experience.
Therefore, forget, at any rate for some time, that a person named . . .
behn lives in the Ashram. That alone will do you good. If . . . behn
finds this an impossible situation she will go. And if she goes indeed,
let her leave with pleasure. Ask me if you have not understood all this.

September 6, 1930
BHAI BECHARDAS,
I have your letter. Really speaking Kakasaheb should reply to it.
But just now I reply as he can write only a limited number of letters.
Take it that the view expressed here is that of us both. I will say
nothing about the method of giving the etymology1. If Kakasaheb
wishes, he will write about it later. After discussing the matter with him,
I understand that your main work is to translate the Agamas2. Shri
Punjabhai has given the money for that work, and it is our duty,
therefore, to carry out the object of the grant as quickly as possible.
You should not mind it if in devoting your time to that work you have
to postpone or delay work on etymology; or you may get it done
through somebody else if that can be conveniently arranged. The idea
in placing Bhakti Prasad at your disposal was not that he might do
original work on his own, but that he might work under you and help
you, and might, if he was persevering, acquire proficiency in the work.
As for your eyes I think you should lay down a limit. You
should be satisfied with whatever help is available in Gujarat. Dr.
Haribhai is a specialist in eye diseases. If he cannot help you, you
should assume that nobody else will be able to and rest content. There
should be a self-imposed limit like this for anyone who has decided to
live a simple life. Do the countless poor have the benefit of help even
from a Dr. Haribhai? This of course is my personal view. I can say
that Kakasaheb now agrees with this view. But this is a delicate matter.
Everyone should lay down the limit for himself according to his own
lights and his own wish. The limits accepted by one person cannot, in
such a matter, apply to all.
BAPU
[PS.]
My reason for using “now” and saying that “Kakasaheb now
agrees” is that, as he tells me, he himself had formerly advised you to
consult one or two other doctors. He now thinks that my view is right.

CHI. MIRA,
Your letter from Tirupur. You now know all about our peace
talks. I have regained the weight I had lost here. I weighed 104 lb. last
Friday. I have dropped the dried fruit also. The sour limes remain. I
take vegetables in the place of dried fruit. Sweet potatoes and raw
tomatoes are standing vegetables. The former are roasted. A green
vegetable is boiled—generally it is cabbage or marrow or the like.
This change accounts for the restoration of the weight andconstipation
no longer worries me. If the change proves successful in the long run,
the cost is considerably reduced. Let us see. I have made no hard and
fast rule about the avoidance of fruit. But just now it is no deprivation
whatsoever and possibly a gain in health.VOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 33My mastery over the wheel is increasing. The fatigue is no
longer felt. I see that if you concentrate on the puni end whilst the
thread is drawing, then on the point of the spindle when the thread is
being shifted to the cone and then on the cone when it is brought
there, you avoid breakage if the puni is sound. I hope shortly to
increase the speed appreciably. It is better even now. But there is
much room for improvement. Anyway, just now it is the wheel that
absorbs my attention to the exclusion of other studies. Kaka is still at
your wheel. He is getting on slowly. The carding-bow is quite all
right. I have no difficulty in adjusting it. Ever since it has been with
me the gut broke only once and that too after Kaka too began to work
on it. He is absolutely new to it but is an extremely careful worker.
Then too I deliberately cut it where I saw it had worn out. Kaka had
devised a new catch for holding the spindle whilst unwinding. It is
fixed to the box. The spindle is mounted on it and the thread is held
between the left hand fingers. The result is that it winds tightly on the
winder. There is saving in time too. On your wheel of course the
spindle remains on the holders whilst the unwinding is done. The
catch was wanted for the box.
I hope you have had some rest somewhere. Do not rush.
Love.

CHI. SUSHILA,
I have a letter from you after a long time. But you blame me,
like a thief turning round on the policeman. You must have got my
previous letter. Sita’s illness has lasted too long. Are you not able to
discover the cause? As I have not seen her myself, I do not have the
courage to say anything in the matter. But I make this suggestion. It
would be advisable to keep her chiefly on milk, curds and fruit instead
of giving her a variety of things to eat. If she is given toast, it should
be of brown bread. I see no need to give her porridge. If you wish,
you may give her cod-liver oil. I myself would never think of giving it
to anyone. But you should attach no importance to this view. How is
your ear? Write to me every week. And write in ink.

I have you letter.
You can write to me as long letters as you please. If Father visits
you there, you may tell him: ‘I am here with your consent. You have
entrusted me to Bapuji. It is therefore my duty to do as he says. Please
do not insist on taking me away. Dasharatha was prompted by his
ignorant love to suggest to Rama that he ignore his pledge. But Rama
refused to do so and saved Dashratha’s honour and upheld the
sanctity of dharma. Let me do the same, and bless me that I may
remain firm in observing the vow taken by you and me.’
You may show this letter to Father. It is good that you are
learning English. Improve Your health. For controlling your mind, try
giving up the extra salt in your food. Pleasure of the palate also is a

Human speech is inadequate to express the reality. The soul is

Individuality is and is not even as each drop in the ocean is an
individual and is not. It is not because apart from the ocean it has no
existence. It is because the ocean has no existence, if the drop has not,
i.e., has no individuality. They are beautifully interdependent. And if
this is true of the physical, how much more so of the spiritual world !
Love.

I have your letter, but see none from Motibehn.
In regard to degrees, after discussing the matter Kakasaheb and
I have both come to the conclusion that there should not be more than
three stages and that for each stage the name of the diploma or the
degree should be the same for all subjects, whether craft or industry or
art or letters or philosophy. At present there are three diplomas or
degrees, Vineet, Visharad and Pundit, in the Vidyapith. Vineet
(Matriculation, Entrance) is one who has acquired general knowledge
in a subject. Visharad (Graduate) is one who has acquired proficiency
in his subject to the extent of being able to teach it to others also. And
Pundit is one who can do research in the subject and write
dissertations and articles concerning it. Having regard to this, we
should for the present, award the degree of Pundit to no one, we may
award the diploma of Dhanur-Vineet or of Dhanur-Visharad. If you
award the degrees or diplomas, see that you do not make them cheap.
Appoint examiners and give the degree or the diploma only to those
who pass according to a prescribed standard.

have known. It is God’s kindness that you are capable of attending to
them. The problem of Keshu seems to be difficult. Be careful and
carry on as well as you may. What made him break with Navin? The
two used to get on very well with each other. You may send me letters
received from abroad, if there are any which you think should be sent
to me. If a letter is very important, make a copy and send me the letter

watch if you have a different experience of her now.

REMOVAL OF  UNTOUCHABILITY
This, too, is a new observance, like control of the palate, and
may even appear a little strange. But it is of vital importance.
Untouchability means pollution by the touch of certain persons by
reason of their birth in a particular caste or family. In the words of
Akha, it is an excrescence. In the guise of religion, it is always in the
way and corrupts religion. None can be born untouchable as all are
sparks of one and the same Fire. It is wrong to treat certain human
beings as untouchables from birth. It is also wrong to entertain false42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIscruples about touching a dead body, which should be an object of
compassion and respect. It is only out of considerations of health that
we bathe after touching a dead body or after an application of oil, or
after a shave. A man who does not bathe in such cases may be looked
upon as dirty, but surely not as a sinner. A mother may be
“untouchable” so long as she has not bathed or washed her hands
and feet after cleaning up her child’s dirt, but if a child happened to
touch her, it would not be polluted by the touch. But Bhangis, Dheds,
Chamars and the like are contemptuously looked down upon as
untouchables from birth. They may bathe for years with any amount
of soap, dress well and wear the marks of Vaishnavas, read the Gita
every day and follow a learned profession, and yet they remainun-
touchables! This is rank irreligion fit only to be destroyed. By treating
removal of untouchability as an Ashram observance, we assert our
belief that untouchability is not only not a part and parcel of
Hinduism, but that it is a plague, which it is the bounden duty of every
Hindu to combat. Every Hindu, therefore, who considers it a sin
should atone for it by fraternizing with untouchables, associating with
them in a spirit of love and service, deeming himself purified by such
acts, redressing their grievances, helping them patiently to overcome
ignorance and other evils due to the slavery of ages, and inspiring
other Hindus to do likewise. When one visualizes the removal of
untouchability from this spiritual standpoint, its material and political
results sink into insignificance and we befriend the so-called
untouchables regardless of such results. Seekers after Truth will never
waste a thought on the material consequences of their quest, which is
not a matter of policy with them, but something interwoven with the
very texture of their lives. Similar is the case of those who have vowed
to remove untouchability. When we have realized the supreme
importance of this observance, we shall discover that the evil it seeks to
combat is not restricted in its operation to the suppressed classes. Evil,
no bigger than a mustard seed in the first instance, soon assumes
gigantic proportions and in the long run destroys that upon which it
settles. Thus this evil has now assailed all departments of life. We
practise untouchability against followers of other religions than our
own, against those who belong to other sects than our own within the
Hindu fold and even against members of our own sect, so much so
that, ever busy observing untouchability, we .become a burden on the
earth. We have hardly enough time even to look after ourselves,.
thanks to the never-ending ablutions and exclusive preparation of
food necessitated by false notions of untouchability. While pretending
to pray to God, we offer worship not to God but to ourselves. This
observance, therefore, is not fulfilled merely by our making friendsVOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 43with untouchables but by loving all life as our own selves. Removal of
untouchability means love for and service of the whole world and thus
merges into ahimsa. Removal of untouchability spells the breaking
down of barriers between man and man, and between the various
orders of beings. We find such barriers erected everywhere in the
world; but here we have been mainly concerned with the
untouchability which has received religious sanction in India and
reduced lakhs and crores of human beings to a state bordering on
slavery.

I have your letter. I was very glad to read in Hamidabehn’s
letter about the courage which you displayed. It is but natural that
Kanjibhai’s daughter should be so brave. On reading about your
courage, I was reminded of a parable in one of the Upanishads. It
compares our senses to horses. The human soul is described as the
charioteer and that which can control these horses, the senses, is
described as a conqueror. That [soul] which lets itself be carried away
by the horses is said to be defeated by them. As you could stop that
horse by the power of your courage, so you and other young women
there ought to ride the senses and control them. If you succeed in
doing so we shall live in Ramarajya, no matter what the outward
circumstances are. Show this to Hamidabehn and explain the idea to
her. May God grant you still greater strength and courage. Teach
Gujarati to Hamidabehn.

very freely these days. Sometimes I even tremble when using it. One

myself to see if I feel the love and sympathy which a father should
feel and am as vigilant as a father should be, and sometimes I tremble
as I do so. I can only state truthfully that I sincerely strive to cultivate
these, and console myself with that thought. I certainly know that
whenever I address anyone as ‘Chi.’, my responsibility increases to
that extent. I hope God will make me worthy of that responsibility.

I have your letter. I have not missed a single post. But it may be
that letters are not dispatched from here in time. I hope Jayaprakash
has recovered now. How is it you don’t get any newspapers there?
They get a good many in the Ashram, and can send you some.
Mother-in-law must have recovered by now.
I have already informed you about my weight. Both of us are
keeping fine? Can you go out for a daily walk there? Do the people
also pray daily? How do you spend the day? What is the approximate
population of the place? What are Jayaprakash’s plans now? Will he
be able to earn anything? Does he worry about anything? Even if you
write directly to me, most probably I shall get your letters. At present,
at any rate, I get such letters. I myself cannot write many letters direct.

I shall not use the formal ‘ aap’ in addressing you. But can love

recognized through the heart. When words come from the heart, they
do have some meaning. Tara’s1 is a sad story. If Tara is firm, if she
has humility, courage and tolerance, she can leave the house of her in-
laws and live with you in the Ashram. You alone can know if you can
give her refuge. Through humility, Tara will be able to win over her

is always extinguished by water, anger is also calmed down by love.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
September 14, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
Your Coimbatore letter before me. It is remarkable how well
you have kept on the whole in the midst of the tremendous rush. It is
a sign of mental calm I expect.
Keshu did offer to send me a bamboo charkha. I would not let
him. The fault was mine in that I did not master the detailed working
of it when there was ample opportunity for so doing. I am now doing
penance by mastering it by making mistakes. I see that the mal and its
proper adjustment have much to do both with speed and efficient
working. I am getting on. I am by no means despondent. The
extraordinary fatigue is gone. There need be no anxiety therefore
about the wheel. Kaka is at your wheel. He can’t yet get more than 80
rounds per hour.
I am sorry about Mrs. Asher’s miscarriage. The chief thing they
should do is to impose restraint upon their carnal desires for at least
three years if they expect a full-grown healthy baby and Mrs. Asher is
to become a strong and healthy mother. To this end they should live54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIseparately if need be. Of course this restraint is in addition to simple
diet, open-air life and plenty of gentle exercise. It would do her a
world of good if she would take Kuhne baths both hip and sitz I am
sure that if she follows the course for three years and has patience she
will be a new woman. You may pass this on to Mrs. Asher if you like.
My walks must still be confined. But I am keeping quite well.
The wheel and thinking about it make the time fly. And at the end of
the day I get good sleep which to me means more than food. I have
finished translating the 65th bhajan. But there is yet a long distance to
cover. I rarely get time to do more than one and I have not yet failed
to do one per day. Though therefore the progress is steady, it is
undoubtedly slow.
Love.

82. FRAGMENT OF LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHI
[September 14, ]2 1930
I smell mental violence even from here. People have not much
appreciated non-violence as a religious principle, but even the fact that
they have adopted it as a policy is evidence of a great change. From
this they will one day appreciate it as a religious principle. If we could
make ourselves living embodiments of non-violence, we would, when
the atmosphere was unfavourable to it, be twice as vigilant and do
twice as much tapashcharya as when the atmosphere might be
favourable.
We don’t pay much attention to the danger concerning
women which you mention, since we always condone men’s misdeeds.
It is good indeed that women have come out. About those who come
out successful from the test, we will say that they have really observed
the Ashram vows and have understood the meaning of dharma. If any
woman falls despite her striving, she will strive again and rise. If a
woman had been secretly nursing gross desires and, having an
opportunity now, gratifies them, we should know that she did not

should welcome that too.
Have no fear, therefore, and don’t worry on their account. Let
each of us take care of himself or herself. It is for God to look after
all. If even a few of us remain pure, they will save those who stray
from the path. Personally I am confident that a good many of us will
remain pure. I don’t like the present state of affairs in which the two
classes have become a mixed crowd. But it is inevitable.
So long as I can write with self-respect, my effort through letters
will continue. I strive through prayers too; no one can prevent me
from doing that.

83. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
YERAVDA MANDIR,
September 14/16, 1930
 CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your letter. I follow your hint concerning the women.
Read my letter to Chhaganlal Joshi. You or Gangabehn should keep
in correspondence with the women who have settled down for work in
different places outside the Ashram. If it seems necessary and if she
can find time, Gangabehn should even pay visits to some of those
places. Lapses will occur in some of them, but we need not be afraid
about them. We should remain, and see that others, too, remain,
sufficiently vigilant and leave the result to God. What indeed is our
tapashcharya in comparison to the degree of self-control we expect
from and wish to see in others? Whatever that is, we wish to follow no
other path. We wish to uphold the fullest freedom for women. It does
not matter if we miss the path on our way, if we stumble, are pricked
by thorns or fall down. I gave the letter on Tuesday as usual, but it
must have been posted late by the office here either deliberately or
through negligence. I have not complained. You should, of course,
write to me whenever you do not get the letters in time. It is good that
Punjabhai has returned. Have you appointed anyone from the AshramVOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 57to look after him? I am writing to Manibhai1 about the money for
honouring the memory of the poet2 which is lying with Reva-
shankerbhai.
 Tell Mrs. Zaulinger that I am awaiting her reply. She may write
to me anything she wishes to without any hesitation. You have acted
rightly in regard to Kamalabehn Lundy. For the present it is best that
she should say or write nothing. There is plenty of silent service she
can do. Balbhadra has done fine work indeed in carding. This shows
that, if we refuse to regard a person as too dull-minded for a particular
thing and go on encouraging him, the result is bound to be good.
I am getting on all right just now. As usual I take milk and
curds. Instead of raisins and dates, I eat daily seven or eight tomatoes,
four or five big-sized, baked sweet potatoes and about six spoons of
cabbage or any other vegetable that is available. This helps me in
passing stools. I drink at 7.30 in the morning the juice of one lemon
with hot water and salt. In the afternoon, I take the juice of one lemon
with soda bicarb. If this regimen suits me, it will solve the problem of
constipation and effect considerable economy. I get the vegetables
from what grows in the garden here. If we count the expenditure, I
don’t. think it exceeds two annas daily, whereas raisins and dates
probably cost every day not less than six annas. Those who suffer
from constipation may try this diet. I cannot say that it will benefit all.
About myself, too, I cannot yet say that the good effect will last. If this
experiment is followed, any other food should be avoided. The baked
sweet potatoes should be eaten by themselves and chewed well. They
should not be dipped in milk or curds. Probably it will do no harm if
one eats the skin. I do eat some. Because of my delicate stomach I am
afraid to eat all. Anybody else who has a similar stomach and who
tries this experiment should also avoid the skin. I would be really
happy if you could find my sandals. Kusum is bound to know about
them. She may have entrusted them to Premabehn. If you have not
yet sent the cotton send it even by post in the last resort. Both the
belts, one of six strings and the other of eight strings, were found to be
too thin. They come off the pulley and go on revolving without

ready with me and I will somehow manage to make others. I asked
you to let me know a simpler method because such a method would
save my time.
September 15, 1930
My silence ended a little while ago and Kakasaheb read out to
me Ramdas’s letter to him. Ramdas says in it that he wrote a letter to
me which I have not received. I was very happy that Ramdas gave in
the letter to Kakasaheb detailed information about his health and
studies. When he is released from jail, we shall be able to write to each
other. I shall then get any letter written by him if I can keep up this
correspondence. I send you the letters in cloth-lined envelopes now. I
have with me only the envelopes received from you. I retain their size
when returning them, so that you may be able to use them again.
Otherwise I could have made them smaller and used them.
Tuesday morning, September 16, 1930
I read in papers about Ba having been harassed in Surat by the
police. Is there any truth in the report?
The law, that to live man must work, first came home to me
upon reading Tolstoy’s writings on bread labour. But even before that
I had begun to pay homage to it after reading Ruskin’s Unto This
Last. The phrase ‘jatmahenat’ is a translation of the English
expression ‘bread labour’. Literally it means labour for roti. The
divine law that man must earn his bread by labouring with his own
hands was first stressed, not by Tolstoy but by an obscure Russian
writer named T. M. Bondoref. Tolstoy took it from him and gave it
wider publicity when he accepted it. In my view, the same principle
has been set forth in Chapter III of the Gita where we are told that he
who eats without offering sacrifice eats stolen food. Sacrifice here can
only mean bread labour. Be that as it may, that verse is the origin of
our observance.
Reason, too, leads us to an identical conclusion. How can a man
who does not do body labour have the right to eat?  “In the sweat of
thy brow shalt thou eat thy bread,” says the Bible. A millionaire
cannot carry on for long, and will soon get tired of his life, if he rolls
in his bed all day long and is even helped to his food. He, therefore,
induces hunger by exercise and helps himself to the food he eats. If
everyone, whether rich or poor, has thus to take exercise in someVOL.50:  23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 59shape or form, why should it not assume the form of productive
labour, i.e., bread labour? No one asks the cultivator to inhale fresh
air, or to use his muscles. And more than nine-tenths of humanity
lives by tilling the soil. How much happier, healthier and more
peaceful would the world become if the remaining tenth followed the
example of the overwhelming majority at least to the extent of
labouring enough for their food. And many hardships connected with
agriculture would be easily redressed if such people took a hand in it.
Again, invidious distinctions of rank would be abolished if everyone
without exception acknowledged the obligation of bread labour. At
present these distinctions have invaded even the varna system in which
there was not a trace of it originally. There is a world-wide conflict
between capital and labour, and the poor envy the rich. If all worked
for their bread, distinctions of rank would be obliterated; the rich
would still be there, but they would deem themselves only trustees of
their property and would use it mainly in the public interest. Bread
labour is a veritable blessing to one who would observe non-violence,
worship Truth and make the observance of brahmacharya a natural
act. This labour can truly be related to agriculture alone. But at
present at any rate everybody is not in a position to take to it. A
person can, therefore, spin or weave, or take up carpentry or smithery,
instead of tilling the soil, always regarding agriculture, however, to be
the ideal. Everyone must be his own scavenger. Evacuation is as
necessary as eating; and the best thing would be for everyone to
dispose of his own waste. If this is impossible, each family should see
to its own scavenging. I have felt for years that there must be
something radically wrong where scavenging has been made the
concern of a separate class in society. We have no historical record of
the man who first assigned the lowest status to this essential sanitary
service. Whoever he was, he did us no good. We should, from our very
childhood, have the idea impressed upon our minds that we are all
scavengers, and the easiest way of doing so is for everyone who has
realized this to commence bread labour as a scavenger. Scavenging,
thus intelligently taken up, will  help one to understand religion in a
different and truer light. If children, the old and those disabled by
illness do not do bread labour, that should not be regarded as
violation of the law of bread labour.60 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThe child is, as it were, included in the mother. If nature’s laws
were not violated, the old would not be disabled and there would be
no disease.

YERAVDA CENTRAL PRISON,
September 21, 1930
DEAR MAJOR MARTIN,
I must now unburden myself of my second difficulty. I do not
doubt a word of what you have told me about the charges of alleged
ill-treatment in this prison. Yet I cannot dispel from my mind all the
reports that have appeared in the Press. The writers could not have
deliberately lied about everything. I am sure that some of the
statements are gross exaggerations. I hope that most are, and I should
like to believe that all are false. But my mind is disturbed. There may
be things you do not know; there must be things which you look at
from one angle and the prisoners concerned from another.
My duty in the circumstances seems to be plain. I must ask to be
allowed to see them occasionally, if I may not be permitted to live with
them. I have told you I desire no privileges. What comforts are
allowed to me may be taken away from me. If I am isolated for the
sake of the comforts, they mean little to me, whereas isolation means
everything to me. I desire no comforts that may not be allowed to the
other prisoners suffering from the same physical disabilities as I. I do
not believe in classification which, in my opinion, is degrading. If I
permit myself comforts which the other prisoners like me do not
enjoy, I do so because of my physical needs1. But I would fain
sacrifice health if it has to be purchased by the sacrifice of the
privilege of serving my companions, many of whom I know and none
of whom I consider to be in any way inferior to me.
I was able to bear the separation so long as I was under the
impression that all was well. But the knowledge that young Ratilal is
no more, that Pyarelal who is like a son to me has been suffering, that
the elderly Narsinhabhai was near death’s door and the persistent
complaints in the Press have awakened me to a sense of my duty, viz.,
that I should strive to the utmost of my ability to establish touch with
them.
1 From the draft available in S.N. 19980. In the source the word is obli-terated.66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII know that it is not in your or the I. G. P.’s power to grant me
the permission requested. I would therefore ask you please to place
this letter before the Government and secure an early reply. I am
aware as prisoner I have no rights and no choice as to the disposal of
my body. But I know also that the upkeep of my body requires my
co-operation. I should no longer be interested [in] the preservation of
a body that cannot be used for the service that the dweller within
yearns after. I am human. Even as a prisoner I cannot divest myself of
the human in me.
I need not give the assurance, perhaps you will be able to give it,
if any be required, that my presence among my companions will not
be used to subvert discipline but on the contrary, it is highly likely to
promote it. The moral code of a civil resister requires him willingly to
submit to all prison discipline that is not in conflict with self-respect.
Lastly I would like to draw the Government’s attention to the
fact that when a somewhat similar incident occurred in 1923 in this
very prison, I was allowed to see two prisoners with the result that what
promised to be a grave tragedy was averted.1 The present Inspector
General of Police is aware of the facts of the case.

CHI. KUSUM (DESAI),
I got your letter. I hear that you yourself are ill. How is that? If
there are mosquitoes, you should ignore what others say and use a
mosquito-net. If you cannot fix one, you may rub kerosene [on your
body]. I cannot straightway request the authorities to keep Pyarelal
with me. I had not made such a request even for Kaka. It is the
authorities who transferred him. I am, however, trying to see Pyarelal.
I made a request to be permitted to see him as soon as I heard that he
was suffering from diarrhoea. He is better now. You should remember
that I do not know who are lodged in this jail. You should assume that
I am confined in a cage. You should have written to me as soon as
you knew.

CHI. BHAGWANJI,
I read your letter. Overcome your resentment of Manibehn.
Forget that she is your wife. Regard her as one of the countless
women. Also forget the children that are with her. Regard them as not
yours. Since you are susceptible to carnal urge, you should
understand that you have no right to [accept] service from Manibehn
even as a sister. You should not call to mind whom you have to forget;
leave, therefore, all worry on her account and shake the burden off
your mind. Show this letter to Gangabehn who will help you to act on
this. Give up jaggery. I would recommend milk even if you could
take only half a seer of it.

You seem to be very clever. You try to evade writing to me
under one pretext or another. And if from making speeches you

of you. Jamnalal seems to have established his business well in Nasik.
I had thought he would. No one can escape him. Formerly Madu used

them as children. If the old really become as innocent as children, the
denigration will be turned into praise. I cherish the hope of getting

I have your letter. It is well that you have sought our
Kamalabehn’s1 company. Try to understand her. Do learn from her
the art of nursing. You may if you wish add salt to the curd, but do
not forget that adding salt only changes the sour taste of curd, it
does not neutralize the acidity. I therefore suggest that when the
curd tastes sour you should add soda to it. Soda neutralizes the
acid in the curd. The acid combines with the soda and evaporatesin
the form of carbolic acid gas, leaving the curd sweet.

MY DEAR KUMARAPPA,
Let me point out a flaw in your calculation. If you “return the
compliment”, you should find out the love notes I send every week.
So if love may be measured arithmetically your notes must be as
many times long as all my notes put together. But thank God! Love
ignores and falsifies both arithmetic and geometry. Yes, Kamalabehn
is doing very well indeed.

CHI. MIRA,
I have your Calcutta letter. You are having a variety of
experiences1. Seekers after Truth turn every one of these to good
account. I hope the little illness you had was but a passing thing and
that you were yourself again quickly. I hope you had the rest you
wanted. I am daily making slight improvements in the travelling wheel
and it gives me less and less trouble. It is wonderful what a number
ofdetails you have to attend to when you have not a perfected
machine but a contrivance to help the cunning of your hands. But the
greater the mastery over the wheel, the greater is the pleasure of
spinning and the less the fatigue. Kaka is still struggling with your
wheel. He has much past neglect to make up for. He says, he has
becomea spinner only here. Before, he was spinning but he was no
spinner. You know what I mean. A man can make a table without
being a cabinet-maker. The change to vegetables persists. There is no
setback nor is there visible further progress. I want to give this
experiment a full trial. Dr. Mehta sent word that perhaps sweet
potatoes might induce constipation. I have therefore dropped them
today. Tomatoes are a daily adjunct and a green vegetable.
You will give my love to friends wherever you are.
Love.

the procession which was lathi-charged. She was taken to a police station and later
allowed to leave. Some university students who shouted at the police for being rough
with the women were mercilessly beaten. The incidents which led to a hartal the next

When I don’t get a letter from you, I cannot help feeling that
something is wrong. Why should you feel depressed? Whenever you
feel so, you should immediately pass on your depression to me.
Whatever your age, from the very first day that I met you I have
regarded you as a dear daughter. I can be both a father and a mother.
You should, therefore, immediately let me share your depression and
then be at peace.
If you feel like coming to see Kaka, take the plunge some time.
. . . behn1 is certainly guilty of one mistake, that she went to test
Bhagwanji. Nevertheless, as long as she is eager to remain in the
Ashram and struggle for self-improvement, we should let her remain.
Our experiments are certainly dangerous. God will see us through
them all, if we have but faith in Him.

CHI. PANDITJI,
It is with a little effort that I can bring myself to put ‘Chi.’
before your name. I do feel for you the love which ‘Chi.’ would
suggest, but I may not have always shown it outwardly. I got your
letter. Learn carding quickly. As for spinning, set apart, if possible, a
fixed time for it. The absence of love of khadi which you notice
around you is but a reflection of some deficiency in us. We are the
centre of the khadi movement. Just as if the sun shines with less heat
the temperature around is bound to go down, so also if we “shine with
less heat”, that is, if we are lukewarm ourselves about khadi, what
wonder that there should be a lack of warmth outside? But love is not
acquired from outside; it must spring from within. If we strive for
such love to spring from within us, good results are bound to follow.
It was very good indeed that Rambhau1 went to Almora.

September 21/23, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
Where is Kamala Gandhi at present? I feel worried about her
because I have had no letter from her for a long time. Where is
Haridas? What is he doing? Prabhavati complains, in her letters of the
last two weeks, that she gets no letters from me. I have been writing to
her regularly. Has she given her correct address to you? The name of
the place is Sitaldiara. As regards Harilal Desai, read the letter I have
written to him. He is likely to be an asset to us. Pay him between Rs.
60 and Rs. 65 for his family and Rs. 40 for his own expenses. In all,
the amount may come to Rs. 100 a month. As for the training, it will
be best to adopt the method I have suggested. During the time that he
is in the Ashram, I think his expenses will be less. They will, I believe,
go up to Rs. 40 when he goes outside the Ashram for studying.
Explain further details and make the position clear as you may think
fit. Is my suggestion all right? I suppose Valjibhai knows all this.
If Giriraj does not recover his calm there, I think it would be
best to let him go to Wardha. However, do what you think proper.
Read the letter to Nanibehn (Budhabhai’s). Read the letter to
Budhabhai, too, and, if Nanibehn agrees, make the arrangements
suggested by him. If, however, she feels hurt, do not interfere. Read
the letter to Manibehn before you give it to her to read. Let
Gangabehn, too, read it. And also read the letter to Zainu. If he does
not understand the position even after this explanation, remember that
he is a guest and tolerate his absence. Read the letter to Bhagwanji,
too. I think the only medicine for him is the one I have suggested.
You have done quite right in sending Balkrishna to Vinoba. You also
did well in offering to send others.
It fills me with great joy to know that the boys and girls have
taken charge of the prayers. And, moreover, no light is required! My
effort to memorize [the  Gita verses] is in abeyance for the time being.
I simply do not get the necessary time. What work can a prisoner have
to keep him so busy? But that is how it is. I have to be careful about
every minute. I read a little by snatching a few minutes from other
work. I agree with your opinion about mixed picketing. Read the
letter to Joshi. I got the cotton and the leather, and Kakasaheb his78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsandals. I got mine repaired and they should now last me for at least
two or three months. I accept your namaskars on your birthday. May

EQUALITY OF RELIGIONS. This is the new name we have given to
the Ashram observance which we know as ‘Tolerance’. ‘ Sahishnuta’
is a translation of the English word ‘Tolerance’. I did not like that
word, but could not think of a better one. Kakasaheb, too, did not like
that word. He suggested ‘Respect for all religions’. I didn’t like that
phrase either. Tolerance may imply a gratuitous assumption of the
inferiority of other faiths to one’s own and respect suggests a sense of
patronizing whereas ahimsa teaches us to entertain the same respect
for the religious faiths of others as we accord to our own, thus
admitting the imperfection of the latter. This admission will be readily
made by a seeker of Truth, who follows the law of Love. If we had
attained the full vision of Truth, we would no longer be mere seekers,
but would have become one with God, for Truth is God. But being
only seekers, we prosecute our quest, and are conscious of our
imperfection. And if we are imperfect ourselves, religion as conceived
by us must also be imperfect. We have not realized religion in its
perfection, even as we have not realized God. Religion of our
conception, being thus imperfect, is always subject to a process of
evolution and re-interpretation. Progress towards Truth, towards God,
is possible only because of such evolution. And if all faiths outlined
by men are imperfect, the question of comparative merit does not
arise. All faiths constitute a revelation of Truth, but all are imperfect
and liable to error. Reverence for other faiths need not blind us to
their faults. We must be keenly alive to the defects of our own faith
also, yet not leave it on that account, but try to overcome those
defects. Looking at all religions with an equal eye, we would not only
not hesitate, but would think it our duty, to blend into our faith every
acceptable feature of other faiths.
The question then arises: why should there be so many different
faiths? The soul is one, but the bodies which she animates are many.
We cannot reduce the number of bodies; yet we recognize the unity of
the soul. Even as a tree has a single trunk, but many branches and
leaves, so is there one true and perfect Religion, but it becomes many
as it passes through the human medium.VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 79All religions are divinely inspired, but they are imperfect
because they are products of the human mind and taught by human
beings. The one Religion is beyond all speech. Imperfect men put it
into such language as they can command and their words are
interpreted by other men equally imperfect. Whose interpretation is to
be held to be the right one? Everybody is right from his own
standpoint, but it is not impossible that everybody may be wrong.
Hence the necessity for tolerance, which does not mean indifference
towards one’s own faith, but a more intelligent and purer love for it.
Tolerance gives us spiritual insight, which is as far from fanaticism as
the north pole is from the south. True knowledge of religion breaks
down the barriers between faith and faith. Cultivation of tolerance for
other faiths will impart to us a truer understanding of our own.
Tolerance obviously does not disturb the distinction between
right and wrong, or good and evil. The reference here throughout is
naturally to the principal faiths of the world. They are all based on
common fundamentals. They have all produced great saints. There is
some difference between tolerance towards other religions and
tolerance towards their followers. We should have equal regard for all
human beings—for the wicked as for the saintly, for the impious as
for the pious—but we should never tolerate irreligion.
This idea may need elaboration. If you do not follow it easily,
ask me.

BHAISHRI VALJI,
You must be aware that formerly I used to write dates according

Everywhere outside India they use dates [according to the Gregorian80 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcalendar]. We must recognize this fact. Besides there is no single
calendar accepted throughout India. Different regions follow different
calendars. Surely we are not going to reject everything foreign. There

I have your letter. I am glad to learn that your health has
improved a little. Tell Kamaladevi when you write to her that I often
think of her. Tell Father that a translation of the whole of the Sirat
would not be fully appreciated, but it would be a valuable book if he
translates its most important portions. Maulana Shibli wrote the Sirat

general public would not read the translation of so big a book. We
already have the works of Amir Ali, Maulvi Mohammed Ali Kadiyani,
Washington Irving and Carlyle. It would be a good addition to them
to get a small book giving a translation of some portions of Maulana
Shibli’s volume. Ramdas writes and tells me that Father is becoming
younger day by day, for he puts in six hours’ labour of writing and
his memory has improved. If so, what does it matter that his beard has
turned grey? And, moreover, he teaches Mahadev French! Who would
not envy him? You daughter and mother have done fine work indeed
in the Kheda district, and Hamida there has been rousing the Surat

September 28, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
I have your letter.
You did not get or take even the full four days’ rest at
Muzaffarpur. Next time I should stick to such promises. Why should
rest not be taken in the spirit of service? Of course, it can be easily
abused and often is. But that is no reason why honest people may not
honestly give themselves rest so as to enable them to keep fit for
further service. I regard it as self-delusion if not worse when a person
says he is wearing himself away in service. Is such service preferred by
God to service steadily and detachedly performed? Body is like a
machine requiring to be well kept for full service. Enough however of
sermonizing from a safe retreat. Only I do feel that I have not felt
ashamed to take the required rest. That people about me have thought
otherwise is because of their ignorance of the laws of rest. Rest
properly and in due time taken is like the proverbial timely stitch.90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIKaka has had to give up your wheel. He could not pull more
than 70 rounds on it per hour. He uses the box wheel. Yesterday was
the third day and he pulled 119 in one hour. He expects to do much
better. I am making daily progress and do not know what fatigue is on
that wheel. It runs with perfect smoothness. It will do still better when I
have myself made the mal of the required thickness. The carding
gives real music. Vithal wrote saying that we should use a candle for
dressing the gut instead of leaves. This change has made the gut give
much better results. I wish those who have new experiences will pass
them on to me. Whatever are feasible here, I shall certainly try. I want
to reach a high standard both in spinning and carding. There is no
reason why I should stop at 160 rounds per hour. I have now
confidence that I should do better. For me it is God’s work. If He
wills it, He will give me the strength and the ability.
Narandas tells me you are not hitting it off with Kumarappa.
Charity is our talisman. I should let him do as he pleases. But of
course I know nothing of the differences. N. gives only one ortwo

DEAR SISTER,
I have your two letters to answer. First, Satis Babu’s question.
The literal interpretation of the battle in Chapter II of the  Gita may
certainly be physical conflict. But I have not a shadow of doubt that
the spirit of the  Gita inclines us to interpret it as mental conflict. The
moment this is doubted, the  Gita will cease to be sacred scripture for
me.
I hope you are well. After consulting Vinoba, do send the boys
desirous of learning Sanskrit to Wardha. Chhotelal is now in jail. I am
very glad to note even the slight improvement in Tarini. Give my
blessings to Tarini, Charu, Arun and others. The tapovanas1 like those
of ancient India can exist even now, it all depends upon our
tapashcharya . Certainly their form may be different. Our duty lies in
going a step ahead of the achievements of our ancestors.

1 Sylvan hermitages96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI147. LETTER TO R. V. MARTIN
YERAVDA CENTRAL PRISON,
September 30, 1930
DEAR MAJOR MARTIN,
It was on 21st instant that I sent you my letter requesting that I
should be permitted to establish touch with the civil resistance
prisoners in this jail. I made the request about seeing my secretary and
co-worker Pyarelal even earlier. I must now press for an early answer.
I know the Government’s preoccupations and, as a prisoner, I should
like to spare them all the trouble l can on my behalf. But the request I
have made is a peremptory call of my fundamental being. I can no
longer restrain myself now. The deprivation of touch with these
fellow-prisoners is unbearable for me. Unless, therefore, I get
satisfaction by Saturday noon next, I must begin to withdraw my
co-operation as to the upkeep of my body. To what extent I shall
carry the non-co-operation, I am unable to say at present. It will be
determined, as the days proceed, by the inner urge and my courage
and strength. The commencement will be made with my refusing all
food except the ordinary convict diet, i.e., such of it as I can
religiously take. I can take only five natural ingredients in addition to
salt. Therefore so far as I can see, I can take only kanji and bajari and
juwari chapati. I may not take dal or vegetables as they contain more
than five ingredients. The kanji and chapati I shall take on the
responsibility of and at the desire of the authorities. I am not sure that
after years of abstention from them, my system can cope with either. I
have arrived at this compromise to start with, because I am anxious to
cause as little embarrassment as I can. I would like the Government
not to regard this letter as a threat but consider it as an act of courtesy
and consideration. My desire is not to take the Government unawares
in any serious steps I may take in order to vindicate what is to me a
human right.
Yours sincerely,
M. K. G ANDHI

September 25/30, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
This time I start with your letter. Last week I ran short of time
and had to be very brief about some points. Write and tell me, if you
know, all about the persons who live in Rajagopalachari’s Ashram,
where Subbiah and his wife are and so on.
Punjabhai must now endure his suffering and pass his days in
peace. If you can, have a further discussion with Mrs. Zaulinger. She
seems to be a wise and good lady, but she takes time to understand
our point of view in everything. I don’t see anything wrong in letting
her join the night-watch, if she feels so inclined. Her argument is
correct. Indian sisters may not be ready  to move as freely as she is
ready to do; if, however, anyone wishes to join her, she may. I have
merely expressed a view from here without knowing all the
circumstances there. Do what you yourself think proper.
What shall I say about Keshu and others? Read the letter which I
shall write to them this time and give it to them. Keshu is an upright
young man. He will probably understand his dharma in the course of
time, and so I don’t feel like writing anything to him. You, for your
part, should be bold and tell him what you think right. This time, of
course, I will write to him.
My diet consists of three pounds of milk turned into curds and
taken at two meals, and milk once. Then nine tomatoes, small or big as
supplied and the required quantity of boiled vegetables such as
cabbage, pumpkin, etc. I add salt afterwards if I require. I gave up
sweet potatoes four days ago. Dr. Jivraj visited Kakasaheb and he
thought that it would cause constipation. I had again found it
necessary to take enemas. I, therefore, decided to see the effect of
giving up sweet potatoes. I observe no change. If I keep up my
strength, I will not resume sweet potatoes. I didn’t think they were
doing me any harm. It is the water of this place which seems to cause
constipation to a person of my constitution. There is, however, no
cause for worry at all. I shall be weighed this evening and will mention
the weight in this letter. Enemas are nothing new to me, but I should
certainly like to do without them if possible. I wish to carry on without
fresh fruit as long as I can. If by eating vegetables I do not98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsucceed in getting rid of enemas and if I feel weak in the slightest
degree, I will resume dates and raisins. No one should worry on my
account.
My spinning is improving. The speed seems to be increasing. At
any rate, I don’t feel tired now. I will not be too eager for the present
to increase the output. I feel a little unhappy that I have had to
abandon the effort to memorize the  Gita verses. But I am waiting for
an opportunity to resume it. In the beginning, I used to try to
memorize them while spinning. But I saw that that interfered with the
spinning. I realize every day the necessity for ever more concentration
for good spinning. I see that there is a great difference between mere
spinning and the art of spinning. I wish to learn the art. Maybe I shall
not succeed in acquiring it during this life. I will be satisfied if I am
not slack in my effort. I realized that my eagerness to learn the  Gita
verses by heart while spinning was a sign of my slackness. That was
against the teaching of the Gita. I wish to memorize the  Gita verses if
I can do that and at the same time acquire proficiency in spinning, but
I would be false to the teaching of the  Gita as I understand it if I tried
to learn its verses by heart at the cost of my spinning. Plead with
Amidas. I am writing to him. How can we ask a person like him to
leave the Ashram?
I shall not be able to send two discourses. Perhaps I will
continue the discourse on equality of religions. I feel inclined to omit
the subject of swadeshi. I feel that by writing on it I may violate to
some extent my resolution to make no reference to political subjects.
Even if I write about swadeshi from a spiritual standpoint, I am bound
to include in the discourse something which would have an indirect
connection with politics. If I feel that I can write on the subject
without touching on politics, I will try. Let me see if I can do so.
There is no point in forcing Giriraj to stay there against his
wishes. If Balkrishna invites him to go to Wardha, what harm do you
see in his going? He is a good man, but he cannot think clearly.
Balkrishna’s company is likely to benefit him. Since you have written
to Vinoba offering to send more persons, why not Giriraj? If he feels
happy, he will certainly work. It does not seem right to me to abandon
him. But, I again seem to be meddling with what I should leave alone.
Don’t, therefore, attach much weight to what I have said. Treat this
merely as a suggestion intended to help you to come to a decision. It
is possible that I may have formed my opinion without knowing allVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 99the facts of the case. I have so much confidence in your decisions that,
when my reason does not accept any of them, I feel that that must be
so because of my ignorance of some facts. And now I reply to your
questions:
1. There is no question of asking him to leave the Ashram,
but I would not ask him to stay on either if he decided to leave.
2. He should not go to Wardha without the consent of the
Ashram authorities.
3. If he does anything against the wishes of the Ashram
authorities and forfeits their confidence, the Ashram cannot
support his children.
4. If the Ashram is not in a position to look after Katu and
Vimu, I cannot think where we can send them. If at present
Giriraj has no share in looking after them, the Ashram may, if it
can, look after them in case he goes to some other place with the
consent of the Ashram authorities. If, however, the children have
become unmanageable, Giriraj should be told so.
5. I think the Ashram should give Giriraj the necessary
financial help to enable him to make some other arran- gement.
The amount of such help should be fixed by the Ashram. I
think I have now replied to all your questions.
Read my letter to Giriraj.
I do not have the necessary data to enable me to decide about
Manibehn. But from what I have understood I feel that she should be
permitted to go to her place if she is very keen on doing so. It is a
question not of what Bhagwanji wishes, but of what Manibehn wishes.
If she wants to stay on, she should be welcome to do so, on this
condition, however, that she should forget Bhagwanji. She should not
wish or hope to see him. She should submit to the Ashram rules as the
other women do. If she is not willing to do this, she should leave.
I understand what you say about Mirabehn and Kumarappa.
Your decision seems right. I am writing to Mirabehn.
Where is Jethalal at present? The names of the fruits which you
said would be on display in our exhibition gave me a pleasant
surprise. I didn’t even know that you had planted grapes.
You need not send my worn sandals. There was a new pair. If
Kanti does not know about it, that is the end of the matter. As I told100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIyou in my letter, I have been able to manage for the present. We shall
see later what we should do if you do not succeed in finding the new
pair. Why shouldn’t a pair from the stock of sandals in the Ashram do
for me? A pair like the one you sent for Kakasaheb will be all right
for me. I would like the sandals better without the dalia such as
Kakasaheb’s pair has. Do send the money for Pyarelal’s living
expenses. You can adopt no other course in his case. He ought to have
drawn money even earlier, which he did not do. The Ashram is all that
he has in the world, call it his friend or anything you will. What you
have done about Gokibehn is worthy of you. Of course, nothing
could have been sent to her from the Ashram. You could have
approached Dr. Mehta, but I liked it very much that you gave the sum
from your own resources. I am sure she needed it. I went through the
figures of spinning on Rentia Barash1. They are very good indeed. I
think Khurshedbehn wants some more women. Find out exactly what
she wants and send someone if you can. If you cannot, give her
convincing reasons why you cannot. As far as I can see, no mature
woman worker is now left there who can go and join her.
September 26, 1930
I was weighed today. The weight is a little above 103, which
means that there has been some improvement. Kakasaheb weighed a
little below 115. That means that there has been no improvement
during the past week. It may not be unusual for him to lose half a
pound or a quarter of a pound occasionally.
You did the right thing in not sending me B. J.’s leaflet. You
cannot send it.
September 27, 1930
Lilavati has again become impatient to go and join
Khurshedbehn. If the latter knows her condition and still calls her, I
think it may be best to let her go. Rather than that she should remain
in the Ashram and feel restless, it is better that she should go and
return wiser from experience. Do what you think best. Satis Babu had
made a balance costing 3 annas for weighing slivers, etc.; if you can
find that or any other similar balance, send it with someone who may

spreading Hindi in Madras?

Did you get the yarn which Kakasaheb had sent through Bal for
the Goseva Sangh? He had sent, through Shankar, 8,500 yardsfor the
Charkha Sangh. Will it be delivered to you there or will it be delivered
at Ahmedabad? Read what I have written about Miss A. in my letter to
Mirabehn.
Tuesday morning, September 30, 1930
As I told you in my letter last week, I have translated into
English the discourse on Equality of Religions and send the
translation herewith. If Valjibhai has translated it and if his translation
has already been printed, he should read the translation which I am
sending. Anybody else who wishes to read it may do so and the last
person should hand it over to Mirabehn. If Valjibhai’s translation has
not been printed, he should carefully go through my translation and
then publish whichever he likes. Do you intend to publish the
discourses in Gujarati only or their English translations also?
This subject is so important that I dwell a little further on it. My
meaning will perhaps become clearer if I describe here some of my
experiences. In Phoenix we had our daily prayers in the same way as
in Sabarmati, and Mussalmans as well as Christians attended them
along with Hindus. The late Sheth Rustomji and his children too
attended the prayer meetings. Rustomji Sheth very much liked the
Gujarati bhajan. “Dear, dear to me is the name of Rama.” If my
memory serves me right, Maganlal or Kashi was once leading us in
singing this hymn, when Rustomji Sheth exclaimed joyously “Say the
name of Hormazd instead of the name of Rama”. His suggestion was
readily taken up, and after that whenever the Sheth was present, and
sometimes even when he was not, we put in the name of Hormazd in
place of Rama. The late Husain, son of Daud Sheth, often stayed at the
Phoenix Ashram, and enthusiastically joined our prayers. To the
accompaniment of an organ, he used to sing in a very sweet voice the
song “Hai bahare bagh ”, “The garden of this world has only a
momentary bloom”. He taught us all this song, which we also sang at
prayers. Its inclusion in our Bhajanavali is a tribute to truth-loving
Husain’s memory. I have never met a young man who practised Truth
more devotedly than Husain. Joseph Royeppen often came to
Phoenix. He was a Christian, and his favourite hymn was “ Vaishnava102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI jana”. He loved music and once sang this hymn saying “Christian”
in place of “vaishnava”. The others accepted his reading with
alacrity, and I observed that this filled Joseph’s heart with joy.
When I was turning over the pages of the sacred books of
different faiths for my own satisfaction, I became sufficiently familiar
for my purpose with Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Judaismand
Hinduism. In reading these texts, I can say that I felt the same regard
for all these faiths although, perhaps, I was not then conscious of it.
Reviving my memory of those days, I do not find I ever had the
slightest desire to criticize any of those religions merely because they
were not my own, but read each sacred book in a spirit of reverence
and found the same fundamental morality in each. Some things I did
not understand then, as I did not in Hindu scriptures. I do not
understand those things even now, but experience has taught me that it
is a mistake hastily to imagine that anything that we cannot
understand is necessarily wrong. Some things which I did not
understand first have since become as clear as daylight. Equimin-
dedness helps us to solve many difficulties and even when we criticize
anything, we express ourselves with a humility and courtesy which
leave no sting behind them.
One difficulty still remains. As I stated last time, the acceptance
of the doctrine of Equality of Religions does not abolish the
distinction between religion and irreligion. We do not propose to
cultivate tolerance for irreligion. That being so, some people might
object that there would be no room left for equimindedness, if
everyone took his own decision as to what was religion and what was
irreligion. Such a question may be raised and one may even make a
mistake in deciding what is religion and what is irreligion. If, however,
we follow the law of love, we shall not bear any hatred towards the
irreligious brother. On the contrary, though we see that he follows
irreligion, we shall love him and, therefore, either we shall bring him
to see the error of his ways or he will convince us of our error, or each
will tolerate the other’s difference of opinion. If the other party does
not observe the law of love, he may be violent to us. If, however, we
cherish real love for him, it will overcome his bitterness in the end. All
obstacles in our path will vanish, if only we observe the golden rule
that we must not be impatient with those whom we may consider to be
in error, but must be prepared, if need be, to suffer in our own person.VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 103As I have stated earlier in this letter, I think I will omit the
subject of swadeshi. I have yet to think on what subject I shall write
next.

149. LETTER TO R. V. MARTIN
October 2, 1930
DEAR MAJOR MARTIN,
Mr. Quinn has been having a chat with me about my letter of
30th ultimo. If you are authorized to let me see periodically in the
yard where I am kept, those of my friends whom I may find it
necessary to see for the sake of service, I should be quite satisfied. Of
course, I would not discuss politics with them nor send any political
message, nor say or suggest anything calculated to subvert prison
discipline. As I told you this morning, my object in wanting to see
these friends is to serve them and, if you would believe it, assist the jail
authorities wherever it may be possible even as I did in 1923.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
October 2, 1930
CHI. PREMA,
If you wish, you may certainly keep the wooden sandals. But
what will you do with those bits of wood? Keep them if you think that
they will add an inch or two to your stature. I would condemn your
action as smacking of idolatry. I used to keep with me a photograph
of my father. I had hung his photographs in the drawing-room and
the bedroom when I was in South Africa. When I used to wear a chain,
it had a locket which contained small photographs of my father and
elder brother. I have now put them away. That does not mean that I
feel less reverence for them now. In fact they are more deeply
engraved in my heart today. I think of their virtues and try to cultivate
them. I can worship countless gods in this manner. If I tried to keep
with me photographs of them all, I would have no room to put them
in. And if I tried to keep their wooden sandals, I should have to
acquire a piece of land for the purpose. As a man of experience, I
advise you, therefore, to follow me when I am walking on the right
path. That will be a thousand times better than keeping my wooden
sandals, and if anybody follows your example, I would welcome that.
On the contrary, if anybody saw the sandals with you and followed
your example blindly, would he not fall into a pit? Think on this and
then do what you wish.
He who understands and does his duty, his cravings have already
left him. A person whose cravings have not left him has no sense of
duty. Our cravings are like a huge mountain which no man
can cross over by climbing. The only course for us is to raze the
mountain to the ground. To give up our cravings is to
become conscious of our duty. Suppose that I wish to go to Kashi.
I even know the path which I should follow to reach it. What
other craving, then, will force me to stray from that path? I have
no other craving but to reach Kashi, and that is satisfied. What more
do I want then? You have an opportunity for service which has
come to you unsought. You should get fullest satisfaction in doing
that service with single-minded devotion. Whatever opportunitiesfor
human company and for reading you get while doing that duty, mayVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 105be availed of. Apart from that, you should desire nothing. This,
according to me is yoga, “skill in works”, “equimindedness” and
samadhi.
If, however, all this seems idle preaching to you and you thirst
for reading, by all means satisfy your craving. Reduce the burden of
work on you and take rest. How you may do this, you can decide only
in consultation with Narandas. He is a man of profound
understanding, patience and goodness. He will certainly help you.
What more can I say to cheer you? A person like me can only suggest
the direction which you should follow. It is on oneself, however, that
you and everyone else should depend for peace of mind.
I understand what you say about Sushila. In future, let her send
her good wishes in Marathi. My blessings to her.
I understand that after having enjoyed Panditji’s music, a
person like you will not enjoy music by anybody else. But why
should you not, yourself, lead the bhajans? If you have the courage to
do so, ask them to let you do it. If you wish, I will write. You certainly
know how to sing. I have not forgotten that you used to sing bhajans
almost every night. How are your tonsils? Did you get them examined
by Dr. Haribhai?

YERAVDA MANDIR,
October 2, 1930
CHI. GANGABEHN (SENIOR),
I have your letter.
If you think you are not worthy of being a daughter, how much
more fit should I become to be a worthy mother and father to you? If
I who claim to be both, am slack in my effort to be so, I shall have no
place anywhere in the three worlds. Let us, therefore, not argue who is
worthy and who is not. If a son or daughter is unworthy, the parents
bear no small responsibility for that.
I understand the reason for your depression. Instead of thinking
that you have to do this, that or the other thing, you should think that
God does all that and uses you as His instrument. If you think thus,
you will feel no burden at all. It is God who carries the burden, and
His shoulders are so broad that however heavy the burden we place on
them He does not feel it even as much as we would a speck of dust on
our hand. We should, therefore, forget ‘I’ and ‘Mine’. “It is I who
do this— that is our ignorance, like that of the dog who thinks he
draws the cart”: this line by Narasinh Mehta expresses his own
experience. ‘ Shakat’ in this line means a cart. If we believe that the
dog who walks under a moving cart draws it, then we may believe that
the burden of our tasks is on us; but anyone who works for the love of
God will never find his task a heavier burden than he can carry. He
does not have to take upon himself anything. Tasks come to him
unsought. He goes on working cheerfully, with God’s name upon his
lips. You sing with sincere emotion: “Make me your servant.” Think
over the meaning of that bhajan. Also think over the meaning of the
two verses which we have added to the prayers for women. It is the
Lord’s assurance to those who surrender themselves to Him that He
will carry the burden of their happiness and welfare. Why, then,
should we worry? This is looking at the matter philosophically.
But even if you and I feel agitated, what escape is there
for us? Our relationship with the Ashram is like the Hindu marriage
bond. The tie can never be loosened. Instead of thinking
whetherothers are half-hearted or firm in their attitude, you should askVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 107yourself whether you are half-hearted or firm, and that is all that is
necessary. Certainly seek what comfort Nath can give you. Talk with
Narandas and pour out your heart every week to me. If you can free
yourself for a few days and pay a visit to Kakasaheb, that, too, will
give you some comfort.
Do not work so hard that you get exhausted. One should always
preserve a sense of proportion in undertaking work in the spirit of
service. We can do that only if we have cultivated the attitude of
non-attachment. Non-attachment means freedom from the sense of
‘I’ and ‘Mine’. The saying that while sleeping one should stretch out
one’s limbs according to the length of the covering has great wisdom
behind it.
Read this letter again and again, think over it and overcome
your depression and put your heart in the bhajan when you sing
“Make me your servant”.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
October 2/31, 1930
BHAI BALVIR SINGH,
Your letter. The work at Khadi Bhandar constitutes not only
proper work but also excellent work. Performance of yajna implies
spinning for half an hour at least. These jobs cannot be evaluated on a
comparative basis as both are part of your duty. Hence you have to
find time for spinning just as you have to find time for meals. It takes
only one day to prepare enough slivers to last for a month. Fewer
slivers will be required if you spin to the fineness of 20 or 30 instead
of 10. Talk it over with Mahavirprasadji. Kakasaheb sends you his
blessings.

DEAR MAJOR MARTIN,
With reference to our conversations, by ‘friends’ I mean those
civil resistance prisoners whom I know. I should want to meet only
those who may be reported to be suffering from illness or
ill-treatment or might have been reported to have so suffered. This
right too, I should exercise with as much restraint as possible. If it is
necessary to explain my meaning further, you will please let me know.
I want to have no mental reservations.
As for postponing the enforcement of my resolution, I am sorry
I must not do it, if satisfaction cannot be had in time. But it need cause
no immediate worry as in the initial stages, I should be eating such
ordinary convict food as I can religiously take.

160. LETTER TO MIRABEHN
YERAVDA MANDIR,
October 5, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
I am writing this after taking silence. Have just seen your
portrait in a group published in the Times Illustrated Weekly . You are
spinning on the takli and looking fit. Then I saw in the columns of
The Bombay Chronicle that you were in the women’s procession and
spoke at their meeting. So you are again near my lodgings and
probably this will be in your hands at the Ashram.
Yes, S. Aiengar’s daughter is a very good woman but she was
hysterical even when we were travelling from Mysore. When you write
to her please give my love to her and tell her I often think of her. It is
a sad thing—her father’s case. It is the same thing with him as with the
daughter. He can be hardly considered responsible for many of his
strange acts. Did you see him at all? Where did you stay whilst in
Madras?
Last week, Kaka having been given my wheel, I thought I would
finish my quota on yours. I tried hard but I could not make it work.
The spindle won’t turn. Whether the resin was ineffective or what the
cause was, I could not divine. But there it was refusing to turn. Then I
thought of the Gandiv of Surat. I found it to be an extraordinarily
effective thing. For the last two days I have been finishing the wholeVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 111of my quota on it and that in very good time and without the slighest
fatigue. It has captivated me and I want you to try it. It is essentially a
poor man’s wheel. The inventor is no mechanic. How it has come to
him, I do not know. But every part of it, in my opinion, shows
solicitude for the starving. It costs Rs. 11/2 but it can be made for only
8 annas, I am sure. It is the lightest wheel going in India. It requires
the least attention. It occupies the smallest space of all the wheels I
know. A little child can work at it. Thousands of these wheels can be
manufactured in a day if the discs and spindles are kept in stock. Its
mechanism is simplicity personified. You naturally draw a fine thread.
The very first I drew was over 30 counts. And I fancy that it can
compete with any in giving speed. It admits of certain improvements,
which can be made without adding a pice to the cost. I have made two
and this reduces the cost. The original has noisy wooden holders. I
have discarded them and put on coir rope picked up from rubbish. I
have broken up the jingling glass bars on the spindle and wound a few
turns of yarn to hold the spindle in position. This has made it
absolutely noiseless. Such is the opinion of a new convert, who has
tried it only for the last four days. It may, therefore, need
modification. But it is undoubtedly a case for believers to give it a fair
trial. I am writing to the inventor suggesting certain improvements and
am writing to Keshu too to examine, try and if my preliminary
observation is at all sound, to improve it. There are other merits I must
not describe, as I have many more letters yet to write. If you can think
of the reason that has prevented the spindle on your wheel from
turning, please tell me.
How did you find Brajkishore Babu? Is he better? Did you see
Prabhavati? She is much reduced and her latest letter says she had
high fever.
And your health? You must not break down at the Ashram.
You will have met Kamalabehn Lundy. Of course you will befriend
her. She appears to be a very good woman.
Both of us are keeping excellent health. My weight, if anything,
shows a slight increase. The vegetable experiment seems to have
proved a success and it gives me joy to know that the disappearance of
even dried fruit reduces the cost very materially. In vegetables, for the
last two days, I have been taking spinach which has moved the bowels
automatically. I take sweet potatoes off and on. I hope you have by
now got all my letters. I have missed no week.
Love.

169. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
October 2/7, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got the Ashram packet yesterday. Mostly the packets are
handed over to me on the very day on which they arrive.
Read the letter which I am writing to Harilal Desai. I have
nothing to write about Giriraj this time. Do what you think best. I was
glad to read about Zainu. I am writing to Bhagwanji. His letter will
have no effect on me. I know his nature. I felt after reading Madhu’s
letter that she was a very innocent girl. I am sure Navin and others will
learn simplicity by and by. I am happy that you trust others. No one
who does so has ever lost anything in the world. The suspicious gain
nothing; on the contrary, they often lose something and exchange
worry for peace of mind. Take care about three things in regard to all
who have got malaria. They should see to it that they clear their
bowels. If they do not do that in the natural course, they should take
either a purgative or an enema. Even after the fever has come down,
they should take 5 grains of quinine daily for a week, dissolvingthe
quinine in lime juice and adding 10 to 15 grains of soda bicarb to the
mixture, drinking it as they would soda water. There will be, and116 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIought to be, effervescence, when the mixture is prepared. Further, for
at least one week after the fever has gone they should live on milk and
black dried grapes or boiled vegetables. Those who have had no
attack of malaria should, if they sleep where there are mosquitoes, rub
kerosene over the exposed parts of the body before going to bed. In
any case everyone should keep his stomach light. Amidas does cause
me worry. I should be happy if my letter has had any effect and he
has started taking milk.
Punjabhai may follow his inclinations and live as he wishes. If
Jamna is treated by the Udasi Vaid who treats Chandrashankar, she
may also benefit. Chandrashankar is all praise for him. Go and see
him once. Read my letter to Gangabehn. Give her some time and
console her. If she comes to Poona even on the excuse of visiting
Kakasaheb, she will have change of air for three days. Keep urging
Nathji. His presence, too, may give peace to Gangabehn. Tell
Mahadev’s mother that you are glad she has come, and that she
should not think of returning to Dihen in the immediate future. If
possible, she should stay on permanently in the Ashram. Read my
letter to Chhaganlal. You will see from it what restraints should be
observed by those who write to me. If in any letter they are not
observed, it should be kept back and not forwarded to me. I think
Khadag Bahadur’s letter did not observe them. Premabehn, too, seems
worried. Read the letter to her and console her. Read my letter to
Kamalabehn Lundi. Some of her suggestions deserve to be welcomed.
October 4, 1930
Read my letter to Chhaganlal Joshi. Everyone who writes to me
should observe the restraints which I have mentioned in it. Any letters
which violate them should be kept back. Khadag Bahadur’s letter was
of that type.1 I don’t want to burden you with the responsibility of
reading all letters. But you may glance through a letter by anyone
who is writing for the first time. Letters by the women never contain
anything objectionable. You will, therefore, need to read only a few of
them. I certainly feel sometimes that I should put in a separate packet
the letters which I write to people there. Perhaps the task of redirecting
the other letters is much too heavy a burden on you. I cannot think
what I should do to reduce it. Since those letters are not such as I
1 Repetition of the four preceding sentences seems to be inadvertent.VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 117need not write, I continue to burden you with the task of redirecting
them.
Read my letter to Harilal Desai, so that you may bear in mind
the suggestion I have made in it. I have recently started spinning on
the Gandiv spinning-wheel. I like it. I can spin on it with almost the
same speed as on the portable spinning-wheel. I hope to increase the
speed. With a few improvements, this wheel can perhaps be made a
perfect model. Read what I have written about it in my letter to
Ishwarlal Vimawala. Read what I propose to write about it in my letter
to Mirabehn too. I should like someone in the Ashram to try it. You,
too, may examine it. I have suggested to Ishwarlal that he should send
two or three wheels. I have seen quite a number of models, but at the
moment I think that among them all this is the only one worth trial
and examination. I will write further about it after I have had more
experience of it.
Tuesday morning, October 7, 1930
I got the cotton and the yarn belt. The cotton was particularly
welcome, as Vallabhbhai is being supplied with slivers from here. I am
awaiting the scale, but there is no urgency about it.
Humility cannot be an observance by itself. For it does not lend
itself to being deliberately practised. It is, however, an indispensable
test of ahimsa. In one who has ahimsa in him it becomes part of his
very nature. A preliminary draft of the rules and regulations of the
Satyagraha Ashram was circulated among friends, including the late
Sir Gurudas Banerji. He suggested that humility should be accorded a
place among the observances. This suggestion could not then be
accepted for the reason that I have just mentioned. But although
humility is not one of the observances, it is certainly as essential as,
and perhaps even more essential than any of them. Only it has never
come to anyone by practice. Truth can be cultivated as well as Love.
But to cultivate humility is tantamount to cultivating hypocrisy.
Humility must not be here confounded with mere manners or
etiquette. One man will sometimes prostrate himself before another
although his heart is full of bitterness against him. This is not
humility, but cunning. A man may chant Ramanama or tell his beads
all day long, and move in society like a sage; but if he is selfish at
heart, he is not meek but only hypocritical. A humble person is not
himself conscious of his humility. Truth and the like perhaps admit of118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImeasurement, but not humility. Inborn humility can never remain
hidden, and yet the possessor is unaware of itsexistence. The story of
Vashishtha and Vishwamitra furnishes a very good case in point.
Humility should make the possessor realize that he is as nothing.
Directly we imagine ourselves to be something, there is egotism. If a
man who keeps observances is proud of keeping them, they will lose
much, if not all, of their value. And a man who is proud of his virtue
often becomes a curse to society. Society will not appreciate it, and he
himself will fail to reap any benefit from it. Even a little thought will
suffice to convince us that all creatures are nothing more than a mere
atom in this universe. Our existence as embodied beings is purely
momentary. What are a hundred years in eternity? But if we shatter
the chains of egotism and melt into the ocean of humanity, we share
its dignity. To feel that we are something is to set up a barrier between
God and ourselves; to cease feeling that we are something is to
become one with God. A drop in the ocean partakes of the greatness
of its parent, although it is unconscious of it. But it is dried up as soon
as it enters upon an existence independent of the ocean. We do not
exaggerate when we say that life on earth is a mere bubble. How is it
possible to cultivate such utter humility? It develops of itself if we
understand the spirit of our observances. Can one who aspires to
follow truth ever be a proud man? A life of service must be one of
humility. He who would sacrifice his life for others has hardly time to
reserve for himself a place in the sun. Inertia must not be mistaken for
humility, as it has been in Hinduism. Because it has been so mistaken,
lethargy and hypocrisy have often flourished in its name. True
humility means most strenuous and constant endeavour entirely
directed towards the service of humanity. God is continuously in
action without resting a single moment. If we would serve Him or
become one with Him, our activity must be as unwearied as His. There
may be momentary rest in store for the drop which is separated from
the ocean, but not for the drop in the ocean, which knows no rest. The
same is the case with ourselves. As soon as we become one with the
ocean, in the shape of God, there is no more rest for us, nor indeed do
we need rest any longer. Our very sleep is action. For we sleep with
the thought of God in our hearts. This restlessness constitutes true rest.
This never-ceasing agitation holds the key to peace ineffable. True
humility, therefore, requires us to dedicate ourselves to the service of
all living creatures. When we have surrendered our all in this manner,
no day in the week is a day of rest for us. This supreme state of totalVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 119surrender is difficult to describe, but not beyond the bounds ofhuman
experience. It has been attained by many dedicated souls, and may be
attained by ourselves as well. This is the goal which we of the
Satyagraha Ashram have set before ourselves; all our observances and
activities are calculated to assist us in reaching it. We shall reach it
some day all unawares if we have truth in us. It is unattainable if we
consciously strive for it.

I have Your letter. One reason why you do not like to spin is
that you are not fully aware of the fact that through spinning you
can serve millions, or, maybe you are not as much interested in
serving them. If that is the case you should correct your attitude.120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIAnother reason may be that you have still not mastered the art of
spinning. Interest is bound to develop if you could spin fine yarn, the
thread does not snap and the spinning-wheel hums along without a
jarring sound. Have you ever seen the Andhra women spinning at an
exhibition? Who would not be interested in spinning if he could spin
like them. The same applies in the case of the Gita. You will like it if
you realize its worth.

objection to a worker going to his home to get proper nursing during
illness, with the willing consent of his co-workers and in order to
lessen the burden on them. It depends on one’s attitude. You shouldVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 121take care of your health and improve it. How can you let it become

CHI. PANDITJI,
I have your letter. I hope your fever has completely left you. I
approve of your idea of reading the Ramayana among the village
people and cultivating contacts with them by that means. But do not
let the opportunity for contacts with them be your motive for reading
the Ramayana . If you read the Ramayana among them, it should be
only in order that they may learn wisdom. If you incidentally get an
opportunity of coming into contact with the villagers, that should of
course be welcome. That is, you should start reading the Ramayana
with the intention of keeping up the practice. Or you may read it
occasionally as a means of cultivating contact with the people, as you
do many other things for the same purpose; that would, then, be a
different thing. Understand the distinction between the two points of
view. I don’t think I shall be able to write the reminiscences of
Gokhale. My preoccupation with spinning will let me do nothing else.

mother-in-law has passed away and that both Jayaprakash and you
have been a good deal shaken. Why should we ever grieve over death,
which no one can escape? Moreover, the lady was quite ill. She
hasbeen released from her suffering. Hence, those whom she has left
behind suffer because of their selfishness. Your duty now is to see that
you get strong quickly. I don’t think your disease has yet left you.

Y. M.,
October 11, 1930
CHI. KANTA,
I have your letter. You are greedy. It is of course good to be
greedy when you are young. But while being greedy one should also
exercise restraint. Hence, of all the things you may wish to learn you
should first learn what will be more useful for service. Another
restraint is that whatever you learn you must do thoroughly  and not
leave half way. Do learn sewing. But do not be hasty. One reason whyVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 125you do not enjoy weaving is that you do not yet know it well. In the
beginning all efforts at learning seem uninteresting. Many people do
not like arithmetic because they find it difficult to learn. But those
who know it can enjoy it as much as they would a novel. Another
reason is that you do not still have enough love for the poor. How can
a person who realizes that every yard of khadi that he produces will
help to cover the back of a poor man fail to take pleasure in
producing it? A mother does with joy for her child and God for his
bhakta what other people would find a boring task. The truth is that
we do not as yet feel real love of service. A servant should find equal
pleasure in all forms of service. All service given sincerely is of equal
worth. Ponder over the verse “He who offers me with devotion a leaf,
a flower, or fruit or water. . .”1 Ask me if you still do not understand.

183. LETTER TO BHAGWANJI PANDYA
YERAVDA MANDIR,

CHI. BHAGWANJI,
The Ashram is for the men of ordinary category. It cannot be
said that the Ashram is curt towards Girirajji if he has reached the
height you regard him to have reached, but that his great soul can no
more be accommodated there. The decision taken by Narandas is
spiritual. The spiritual point of view is to act as guided by whatever
ideals we have accepted for the Ashram. Personally I think Giriraj has
fallen into delusion. I would not engage myself or involve another in
the regimen undertaken by us if it is not going to help us realize the
atman. It is possible that God might live in the house of a scavenger
and He may not be found in that of a Vedantin. Our action should
accord with our lofty sentiments. Giriraj is a noble person, he is
humble too; he will therefore come round after his ramblings. The
credit will go to the Ashram even if we were to learn from him in case
he proves our way to be wrong. Please remain calm.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
October 12, 1930
CHI. KASHINATH,
I have your letter. There is not the slightest reason to be grieved
by the death of friends. None ever dies before his time. The notion of
untimely death is a delusion. Even the death of a day-old baby is not
an untimely one. It only means that the actions to be performed
through that body had been performed. We feel pained by death only
because of our ignorance and selfishness. We feel agitated over
thedeath of friends or others because of our ignorance of the soul’s
attributes and because we do not wish ourselves to die. Yes, we owe a
duty to the widows. If they come and can observe the rules, in my
view at any rate there should be no objection to admitting them.
However, as the responsibility lies on Narandas and Gangabehn, you
should discuss the matter with them. Show this letter to them.
Though Kalavati is indeed in a hard plight, she will be fully tried
and the strength of her mind tested. I am writing to her. I have
received the Hindi translation of Kumarappa’s speech. Mahavir
Prasad’s zeal is beyond praise. He has already started working for the
third edition of the Gita.
You ought to get over your depression now. If any depressing
thoughts or impure desires arise in your mind, note them every time
and drive them out. Do not let your mind dwell on them; do not even
debate within your mind how they occurred, but keep the mind
engaged in good thoughts. The golden means of doing which is that
the mind, too, should be kept fully occupied in some external activity,
so that it may have no time at all to wander.

[October 13, 1930 ]1
CHI. MIRA,
I hope you have got the straying letters. I am sure they have not
been intercepted, but have been delayed in transit from place to place.
It is evident, my ‘scolding’ as you call it, was well deserved, for
you have returned in a dilapidated condition. On the top of that, you
had a bad accident. Now you would be as good as your word and take
full rest. I was much relieved to understand that you had been visiting
the Sardar. That showed that you were well enough to travel.
I am still at the Gandiv wheel, and my rapture continues, if
anything it has increased. I am spinning scientifically now, i.e., with a
yard measure underneath the track of the yarn as it is drawn. I can
draw 8 threads in one minute and I pull at least two feet to each draw.
This means 240 rounds or 300 yards per hour. But of course, I do
nothingof the sort in an hour but that is not because of any defect in
the Gandiv. The less output is due to breakages and consequent waste
of time. But since adopting the method of concentration, breakages
have very considerably reduced. I therefore often reach 200 yards per
hour which for me is very good. You will publish nothing just yet of
my views about the Gandiv. I want the report of those who may try at
the Ashram. Most of all I want your report, if you have the leisure and
the inclination to give it a trial. I know that you all have not the time
that I have for these experiments. You will therefore do whatever is
possible and if you think it necessary. I, having nothing else to do,
may easily exaggerate the merits of a thing which I may have
disregarded before as I did and which now gives comparative
satisfaction.

CHI. NARANDAS,
Your packet was given to me late last evening. I will certainly
inquire why you got the post late. But that will often happen and you
should not, therefore, worry if you do not get the post on the day
expected. You should, however, be regular in posting the letters at
your end.
Both of us were weighed today. We are weighed every
Thursday. Kakasaheb’s weight is between 115 and 116, which means
that there is some improvement. My weight came to 104. I have
discontinued taking enema since four days ago. I eat tandalja and
that has had a beneficial effect. I have not given up ratalu altogether.
I intend to take it twice or thrice in a week. On the other days I will eat
patakalu or some other vegetable. I still continue tomatoes. So far, I
have not felt the need for fruits. If the weight remains steady, I intend
to continue as I am doing. My promise that I will take care of my
health in whatever experiments I make should reassure all of you.
I do not feel that your letters are too long. I should certainly
like to see that the burden on you does not increase. Your work is to
see the letters which I write, to distribute them to the addressees and to
write to me. I think your having to send letters written by others is an
extra duty. It is so because really speaking it is not right for me to134 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIexpress opinions from here. It is a mere accident that we are able to
send and receive letters.
I got Radha’s long reply. She writes in it about . . .1 having
stolen something and other such matters. She says that Keshu was
upset when he knew about the thing. What are the facts? Read the
letter I shall write to . . .2.
I have nothing to say about your decision regarding Giriraj. I
think it is perfectly correct. You alone know all the facts. I hope to
know by and by what has been done about the children. What can one
say about Amidas? His courage inspires nothing but respect. I feel
unhappy in so far as I was responsible for his vow of not taking milk.
Now that his father is there, I don’t worry any more about
him. We should do all we can to look after him. It is God who will
protect him.
I suppose Bhagwanji will accept responsibility for Manibehn’s
expenses. I saw Pyarelal. No harm has been done to his health. It is
weak, though. I believe I shall now be able to see him frequently. He
gets bread and milk at present.
I didn’t see any letter from Chitalia. I don’t remember at the
moment the sum which he requires as help. I think I did ask someone
to note it. His letter is likely to be in one of the files. Shivabhai and
Chhaganlal will probably know about it. Perhaps Raojibhai, too, may
know.  Chitalia  himself   will  be  able  to  tell  you.  Has  he  asked
for
Rs. 1,500 for the building? Ascertain the position and do what
you think best. If necessary, you may write to me again about the
matter. Read the letter I have written to him.

I read the new ordinance. You, too, will have to think about the
matter. I myself wish to say nothing from here. Discuss the matter

such measure.

2 ibidVOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 135Tuesday morning, October 14, 1930
In this series, I have dealt cursorily with the importance of vows,
but it is perhaps necessary to consider at some length their bearing on
a godly life. Now that I have discussed all our vows except that of
swadeshi, let us consider the necessity of vows. There is a powerful
school of thinkers who concede the propriety of observing certain
rules but do not acknowledge the necessity of vows. They go even so
far as to suggest that vows are a sign of weakness and may even be
harmful. Again they say that, if a rule is subsequently discovered to be
inconvenient or sinful, to adhere to it after such discovery would be
positively wrong. They say: “It is a good thing to abstain from liquor,
but what harm is there in taking it occasionally, say on medical
grounds? A pledge of total abstinence would be a needless handicap;
and as with liquor, so with other things. Why may we not even speak
an untruth for a good end?” This argument does not convince me. A
vow means unflinching determination, and helps us against
temptations. Determination is worth nothing if it bends before
discomfort. The universal experience of humanity supports the view
that progress isimpossible without inflexible determination. There
cannot be a vow to commit a sin. Such a vow represents a wicked
nature. In the case of a vow first thought to be meritorious but later
found to be sinful, there arises a clear necessity to give it up. But no
one takes, or ought to take, vows about dubious matters. Vows can be
taken only on points of universally recognized principles, which,
however, we do not habitually act upon. The possibility of sin in such
a case is more or less imaginary. A devotee of Truth cannot stop to
consider if someone will not be injured by his telling the truth, for he
believes that truth can never do harm. So also about total abstinence.
The abstainer will either make an exception as regards medicine, or
will be prepared to risk his life in fulfilment of his full vow. What does
it matter if we happen to lose our lives through a pledge of total
abstinence? There can be no guarantee that our lives will be
prolonged by liquor, and even if life is thus prolonged for a moment,
it may be ended the very next through some other agency. On the
other hand, the example of a man who gives up his life rather than his
pledge is likely to wean drunkards from liquor and thus become a
great power for good in the world. Only they can hope some time to136 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsee God who have nobly determined to bear witness to the faith that is
in them even at the cost of life itself.
Taking vows is not a sign of weakness but of strength. To do at
any cost what one ought to do constitutes a vow. It becomes a bulwark
of strength. It makes no difference whether such a resolve is called a
vow or known by some other name. A man, who says that he will do
something “as far as possible” betrays either his pride or his
weakness, though he himself may attribute it to his humility. There is,
in fact, not a trace of humility in such an attitude of mind. I have
noticed in my own case, as well as in that of others, that the limitation
“as far as possible” provides a fatal loophole. To do something “as
far as possible” is to succumb to the very first temptation. There is no
sense in saying that we will observe truth “as far as possible”. Even as
no businessman will look at a note in which a man promises to pay a
certain amount on a certain date “as far as possible”, so will God
refuse to accept a promissory note drawn by a man who will observe
truth “as far as possible”.
God is the very image of the vow. God would cease to be God if
He swerved from His own laws even by a hair’s breadth. The sun is a
great keeper of observances; hence the possibility of measuring
timeand publishing almanacs. He has created in us the faith that he
always rises and will for ever continue to rise, and thereby given us a
sense of security. All business depends upon men fulfilling their
promises. There could be no commerce if merchants did not regard
themselves as bound by their word to one another. We thus see that
keeping a vow is a universal practice. Are such promises less necessary
in character building or self-realization? We should, therefore, never
doubt the necessity of vows for the purpose of self-purification and
self-realization.

BHAI GHANSHYAMDASJI,
I have your letter. Mirabehn too had made some reference.
No one is perfect in this world. Our duty is to rid ourselves of
the imperfections and that is what human effort is for. Despair has no
place as long as we put in our own efforts. In spiritual matters we need
infinitely greater courage than what we need in worldly matters. One
should never give up self-confidence. Faith can make everything
possible.
I too hold that Pujya Malaviyaji will not fall ill. In fact, I believe
that he will have true rest and peace in the jail.2 He very much needed
both for many years. God has thus granted him both.

should never be content with one’s purity of motive[alone]. The
necessity of knowledge has been accepted for the reason that one may
not commit an error in spite of a pure motive. This also you should
know for certain that as you achieve purity the Ashram too becomes
pure to that extent. The purity of the Ashram is not different from
that of any Ashramite. As far as the Ashram goes, there is no one who

200. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
Thursday evening [October 16, 1930 ]1
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got the letters sent by you. I write this letter specially regarding
Amidas. It will, therefore, be immediately cleared. Will Amidas agree
to take raw eggs? There are two kinds of eggs, one to which exception
may be taken and the other unexceptionable. The former are those
which ultimately produce chicken, and the unexceptionable are those
which produce no life. Hens lay such eggs without their having been
inseminated by cocks. This is a well known fact. Parnerkar will
probably know about it. Such eggs are available in the market. Mostly
Europeans look after the production of such eggs. There is a farm for
this purpose near Miraj. You will find some correspondence on this
subject in my file. You need not, however, search for it. Many Parsis
in Ahmedabad will be able to give you information about where such
eggs are available.  Personally  I  believe that eggs of this kind are less
1 As in the printed source140 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIobjectionable than milk. In eating them, we do not deprive any
creature of its food, as we do by taking milk.
If Amidas agrees, obtain such eggs immediately. They are to be
used in this manner. Break an unfertilised egg, mix its contents with
eight ounces of water and keep the mixture in a bottle. Give him an
ounce of this mixture every hour. He will soon gain strength. The
mixture will completely serve the purpose of milk. I can say that
Manu’s life was saved by this mixture. Such eggs are a hundred times
better than cod-liver oil. Tell Amidas that if there is any sin in acting
upon this advice, I take it upon myself. I have not publicly advocated
the use of such eggs because, when self-indulgence is on the increase
and all kinds of medicines are being consumed without hesitation, I
did not think it proper to add one more to the list. Amidas’s case is
quite different. I hope Parnerkar has recovered.

I think fresh milk, fruit and curds, which should not be sour, will be all
right for her. If her teeth are strong enough, she may be allowed to
chew a few hard biscuits or pieces of khakhara during the day. She
should learn to chew properly what she eats. Madhavjibhai’s two
children are being brought up on this diet, and they have radiant
health. Have you consulted a doctor for your ears? I think Manilal
informed me that you intended to consult somebody. If you once get
them examined by a doctor whom you know and understand the

Your letter. But how did you fall ill? Was there any mistake
about your diet? As far as your asthma is concerned you must treat it
so ruthlessly that it does not visit you again. You will succeed if you
are firm. Do you take sun-bath? Do you massage your chest? Do you
keep your bowels clean? After the morning prayers you must do
deep-breathing on an empty stomach. This would clear the lungs. We
must take deep breaths so that the oxygen may clear our lungs. You

Personally I believe that the only remedy for your ear complaint is
better general health. Since you also believe so, you should take

honour for a prisoner. If we think this way, we would not feel hurt.

I have your letter. In your previous letter I saw no impropriety.
You had only poured out in it the thoughts which agitated your mind
and you had a right to do so.
Humility cannot be learnt through formal training, but it grows
of itself as one cultivates the spirit of non-violence. Outward humility
of behaviour, which we find in royal families, can be learnt in a formal
manner. It is, however, not true humility, but is only a part of cultured
manners. In the humility which I advise, one has to forget the sense of
‘I’ and become a mere cipher. Can that be learnt through any
lessons? But one who has realized the body’s transitoriness and has in
some measure become aware of the self soon becomes humble. What
fine humility would it be on your part if, even though I should speak
in anger to you, you merely listened with lowered eyes like those of a
poor cow and did not even feel angry with me? Such humility comes148 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIonly when you have learnt true self-respect. If you have not
understood my meaning, ask me again and again. I shall not get
tiredof explaining it. Have you completely recovered now?

I interpret image-worship in two senses. In one form of
image-worship, the person who contemplates the image becomes
absorbed in the contemplation of the qualities for which it stands. This
is image-worship in its wholesome form. In the other form of it, the
person who contemplates the image does not think about the qualities
but looks upon the image itself as the primary thing. This is idolatry
and is an evil.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
October 19, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
I have your letter from Bombay.
I was glad to learn that you were feeling better. You must not let
the mind get into the state described by you. If you work with
detachment, you will refuse to be rushed and you will refuse to let
anything get on your nerves. Having put one’s whole heart into a
thing entrusted or undertaken, one can leave the result to God. Then
there can be no rush and no worry. You know the story of King
Janak. He was Duty personified. His capital was in flames. He knew it.
But some busybody reported it to him. His answer was, “What care I
whether my capital is reduced to ashes or remains intact!” He had
done all he could to save it. His going to the scene of operations and
fussing would have distracted the attention of the fire-brigade and
others and made matters worse. He was but an agent of providence. As
such he had done his part and was therefore ‘quits’ and at ease. So
may, must, we be, if we have done our best, whether our work
flourishes or perishes.
The Gandiv still gives me joy and satisfaction. Nothing has yet
broken down. Whereas I took five hours before, I now finish well
within 3 hours. The afternoon is now free for other work except for
the takli. So on your travels you may take the Gandiv if it gives you as
much satisfaction as it gives to me. The cost of the pattern that I have
is one rupee including the spindle and a box scooped in the platform
and an incredibly simple device for keeping the spindle on one side
of the platform. For price and simplicity this wheel has no match. I
have discarded the bamboo holders and the wretched glass cylinders. I
think I told you this. And it works without any foreign sound at all.
Love.

Having come to know you better, I don’t feel inclined to lay the
blame on you. It is only that you two have different natures and,
therefore, cannot live in harmony with each other. In these
circumstances, it is best that you should now live apart from each
other. God has blessed you with a large family. You ought not to feel
unhappy that you have no son. We make no difference between a son
and a daughter. A daughter is the same to us as a son. Moreover, all
the girls are wise. You should, therefore, live perfectly contented.
Jaisukhlal will meet your expenses. Be devoted to each other, though
living apart. Don’t feel unhappy in any way. Neither of you is
following an improper path. When you can forget yourself and feel
one with Jaisukhlal, you may certainly go back and live with him. If
you encourage the girls to go and live in the Ashram, they will be
happier in life.

Benarsidas.2 You did well to inform me. Behn Shanta3 must have fully
recovered now. She requires hip-baths and frictionbaths. Consults
Kuhne’s4 book for a description of both. It is the experience of
women that friction-bath brings quick and significant benefit. You
seem to have had a fair measure of success in stopping funeral feasts.
If pure-minded people make a sustained effort they are bound to
succeed sooner or later. The difficulties experienced in sending
Kalavati home should have been anticipated. That is what the world
has come to. When the times are changing people of older generation
are bound tofeel some of the things of the new age irksome. If the
new age bears with their displeasure while firmly going its way, it will
prevail without much noise.

BHAI BANARASIDAS,
Bhai Kashinath has given me the news of your wife’s death. A
great calamity has befallen you. We have given up the fear of death,
but we grieve out of selfishness. I understand you have children of
tender age. But why grieve over that too? Such things do happen in
the world. All such events are moments of trial to us. Only such an
occasion can prove if all our assiduously acquired knowledge is truly
assimilated. May God grant you peace.

I have carefully gone through your letter. It is difficult to advise

at any cost. If you have the slightest doubt, you should obey your

please let me know if there is any objection to its dispatch?”158 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI230. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
October 16/21, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
I have your letter. The occasional delay in your getting my
letters can’t be helped. “Make the best of today, for who knows what
tomorrow will bring?” This is true of our present circumstances too.
If the men in charge of the factory at Bardoli have not been arrested,
what about the goods in factory? I read in newspapers that they, too,
were confiscated.
It was a matter of surprise that the Ashram had remained free
from malaria. At last it could remain so no longer. I think it can be
kept free from it. In the malarial season, one should take care and see
that one’s stomach is light. Starchy and other indigestible foods, like
pulses, should be avoided. If those who have escaped malaria so far
take care, they will be able to preserve their health. The water in the
well should be disinfected with potassium permanganate or chlorine. I
think these can also be added in the water fetched from the river. If a
few drops of the solution are poured into the river water where it is
stored, it will acquire a light rose colour. After a while, the colour will
settle at the bottom. You should consult a doctor for more
information about this. I will write a separate letter about Amidas,1
which is likely to be posted only tomorrow. Inform me on what day
you get it.
Inform Jamnalalji that I do not request the authorities to bring
anyone here. I did not do that even for Kakasaheb. Jamnalalji or
anybody else who wishes to come may do so by trying on their own
or through Government’s kindness. I have been able to arrange that
Pyarelal should see me from time to time. There is an element of
selfishness in requesting to be provided with a companion and,
therefore, I do not make such a request. What I should like is to be
kept with all the others. But how can I expect such good fortune?
Somebody who came to visit Kaka told him that Mathuradas, too, had
made a similar request. I have already written to you about Giriraj. I
don’t feel that your decision is wrong.
1 Vide “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 16-10-1930.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 159Write to Rajaji and tell him that generally I do not write to
eminent leaders and, therefore, I will not write to him either. But I
remember him every day.
Ask him to give me news about Lakshmi and Subbiah’s wife.
What state of health has he brought with him?
October 19, 1930
I see Prabhavati’s name in your list of letters, but I don’t find
her letter. I don’t think they have kept it back here. Either it must
have been left out there or her name came to be included this time just
because she writes every week. Anyway I had a wire from her giving
me news about her health. She seems to be all right.
In Wardha they have been spinning on the takli very regularly.
You must have read a description of their work in Balkrishna’s letter.
Bhau’s speed is 132 rounds for half an hour. This is wonderful. You
should find out how such speed can be acquired and publish a
detailed description. My satisfaction in regard to the Gandiv
spinning-wheel remains what it was; if anything, it has increased. Read
my letters to Mirabehn and Ishwarlal Vimawala on the subject. The
latter has written to me saying that he will send one more wheel to me
too. Pay him for it and for the wheels which may be received in the
Ashram. Send me your conclusions after you have tested the model.
Also send me the figures of the count, strength and evenness of
Kakasaheb’s yarn received there.
Read what I have written in my letter to Maganbhai about the
spindle-bearer in use in Bardoli. My own experience is that it is
superior to the type fitted to the spinning-wheel in use in the Ashram
and in all other models. If this is true, we should fit our spinning-
wheels with the same type of spindle-bearer as they use in Bardoli. If
my judgment is wrong, I should be corrected. If anyone prefers the
type being used in the Ashram and if he has had experience of that
being used in Bardoli, he may write to me about this matter. It is my
belief that even from the point of view of speed the Bardoli
spindle-bearer would ultimately be found superior to the others. If I
get the necessary facility, I will try to fit even the Gandiv spinning-
wheel with that type.160 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII wrote to you last Friday about Amidas. You must have
received the letter. I may even get your reply before this letter is
posted. Send me a wire if you have not received that letter. I will then
discuss the matter again.
October 20, 1930
Read my letter about Kanta. It seems she wants to go out
for a few days at least. Think about the matter. From here, what
I feel is that she may go for a few days wherever she likes. She is
both truthful and brave. She will be able to look after herself. She will
also keep any promise she makes. This is my own experience,
however. You should do what you think best. Find out what she
wishes.
Tuesday morning, Diwali,
October 21, 1930
My blessings to all the friends there. My Vandemataram and
due regards to everyone. May we be filled with greater spirit of service
during the next year, and become fitter instruments and more awake
to our duty in that regard.
We make frequent use of the word ‘yajna’. We have raised
spinning to the rank of a daily mahayajna . It is therefore necessary to
think out the various implications of the term ‘ yajna’. ‘Yajna’ means
an act directed to the welfare of others, done without desiring any
return for it, whether of a temporal or spiritual nature. ‘Act’ here
must be taken in its widest sense, and includes thought and word, as
well as deed. ‘Others’ embraces not only humanity, but all life.
Therefore, and also from the standpoint of ahimsa, it is not a yajna to
sacrifice lower animals even with a view to serving humanity. It does
not matter that animal sacrifice is supposed to find a place in the
Vedas. It is enough for us that such sacrifice cannot stand the
fundamental tests of Truth and Non-violence. I readily admit my
incompetence in Vedic scholarship. But the incompetence, so far as
this subject is concerned, does not worry me because, even if the
practice of animal sacrifice be proved to have been a feature of Vedic
society, it can form no precedent for a votary of ahimsa.
From this definition of yajna it follows that a primary sacrifice
must be an act which conduces the most to the welfare of the greatest
number in the widest area, and which can be performed by the largest
number of men and women with the least trouble. It will not,
therefore, be a yajna, much less a mahayajna , to wish or to do ill toVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 161anyone else even in order to serve a so-called higher interest. And the
Gita teaches, and experience testifies, that all action that cannot come
under the category of yajna promotes bondage.
The world cannot subsist for a single moment without
yajna in this sense and, therefore, the Gita, after having dealt with true
wisdom in the second chapter, takes up in the third the means of
attaining it and declares in so many words that yajna came with
Creation itself. This body, therefore, has been given us only inorder
that we may serve all Creation with it. And therefore, says the Gita, he
who eats without offering yajna eats stolen food. Every single act of
one who would lead a life of purity should be in the nature of yajna.
Yajna having come to us with our birth, we are debtors all our lives
and thus for ever bound to serve the universe. And even as a
bondslave receives food, clothing and so on from the master whom he
serves, so should we gratefully accept such gifts as may be assigned to
us by the Lord of the universe. What we receive must be called a gift;
for as debtors we are entitled to no consideration for the discharge of
our obligations. Therefore we may not blame the Master if we fail to
get it. Our body is His to be cherished or cast away according to His
will. This is not a matter for complaint or even pity; on the contrary, it
is a natural and even a pleasant and desirable state, if only we realize
our proper place in God’s scheme. We do indeed need strong faith, if
we would experience this supreme bliss. “Do not worry in the least
about yourself, leave all worry to God,”—this appears to be the
commandment in all religions. This need not frighten anyone. He
who devotes himself to service with a clear conscience will day by day
grasp the necessity for it in greater measure and will continually grow
richer in faith. The path of service can hardly be trodden by one who
is not prepared to renounce self-interest and to recognize the
conditions of his birth. Any service rendered by such a person will be
tainted by selfishness. But, then, men of such utter selfishness are rare
in this world. Consciously or unconsciously, every one of us does
render some service or other. If we cultivate the habit of doing this
service deliberately, our desire for service will steadily grow stronger
and will make not only for our own happiness but also for that of the
world at large.

you do. How fine it would be if you spin that number of rounds every

I have your letter. It is the opinion of an experienced doctor that
to guard against rheumatism in old age one must regularly take soda
bicarb. You probably know that I must be taking nearly 20 grains of
soda every day in one form or another. Plaster may help a little. The
cause of the disease is inside the system. This pain is a warning to you
not to mind expense on fruit. You should live mainly on milk and
fruit. If you let the rays of the sun fall on the knees, that will help you.
Eight in the morning is excellent time for doing that.

Your letter. The best way you can return Mother’s love is to
deny yourself the joy of her company and personal service to her. Till
Father wants you under his roof, you are better away from home. I am
sure mother will feel happy in the thought that you are doing well in
body and mind. At the same time you should shed all irritation
against Father. Do not count against him every remark he may make
about you. You must cultivate a big heart. And then you will find that
Father will be reconciled to you the sooner for your broad-
mindedness.

You ought to understand that one whose [own] mind is not

Giriraj well. He has lofty ideas but his strength to live up to them is
very inadequate. Yet I have hopes for him because he is always
striving. The aim of the Ashram is to insist on truth and on conduct
conforming to truth. Everything is organized with Truth as the focal
point. There are not many ideals in the world and there ought not to
be. The apparent manifold is only a golden lid hiding the Truth.1

Your letter as also your detailed directions about the working of
the Bihar wheel. I attended to all the matters as you have put except
the point where the mal should cross. I do not know whether it crossed
nearest the platform or away from it. However I shall make another
effort to see whether it works at all or not. It ought at least to work.
Meanwhile the Gandiv continues to give much satisfaction. It has not
yet caused any trouble and did I tell you that it did not require the
removal of the spindle after each day’s work. After the work, it is
hung up on the wall. It thus requires no attention every morning as all
the other wheels do. And the more I work it, the greater becomes the
conviction that it is capable of giving as much output as any single
wheel. I have got the scales now. I seem to spin 24 counts and over
and my highest speed is 200 rounds, very considerable improvement
on the box wheel. Only once do I remember having attained that

more efficient spinners confirm it from their own.

up your body anew. We are both keeping good health. I weighed last

Though the letter is from Panditji I am writing to you. I always
wish to write to anyone who is unwell. Why should you fall ill while
serving? But illness always comes like a thief, however watchful one
may be. I hope you have driven out the intruder. Do not neglect your
health. Does Mathuri still feel weak? Some children become sturdier

You have become very nervous. But you have no reason for it.
If now the burden of running the home has fallen on you, you are
strong enough for that. If the responsibility is yours, you ought to
have the corresponding rights too. You can manage your home as it
seems best to you. Jayaprakash will certainly help you in that. You
may talk about everything with your father-in-law with the freedom of
a daughter. At first he will feel embarrassed but by and by you will
see that he, too, will talk freely with you and remove the difficulties
from your path. Moreover, you have servants to help you. You should
take due care of your health while looking after the affairs of the
home. Do not work beyond your strength. Save some time for
reading, for going out for a walk and resting, and make yours a model
home. It will be a problem for you only if you do not have full
authority to do what you wish to do. But I simply cannot believe at the
moment that you will not get such authority. Have confidence in
yourself. Learn to be firm. God will save you and lead you. In any

YERAVDA MANDIR,

BHAISHRI BHAGWANJI,
I got your letter. I felt unhappy on reading the news about Bhai
Revashanker. His simplicity was indeed as you describe it to be. I have
no doubt that his soul rests in peace.
I send with this a letter to Devchandbhai in regard to Sudarshan,
but what more can I do from here in this matter?
I am very much pained to know what you say about Bhai
Narbheram. It would give me a great shock to believe that he could be
dishonest. My advice regarding him is that you should suggest to him
to let an arbitrator examine the claim against him and give his
decision. If he does not agree, you should put up with the loss. I
would not advise you to take the matter to a court of law. The prestige
which the Bank of England enjoys in London, or rather in the whole
world, is enjoyed by Kars [anji] Moolchand in our small world of
Rajkot. In their respective spheres, they enjoy equal prestige. I should
very much like that prestige to be re-established. You should certainly
not fight [in a court]. Money is not the only important thing in life.

do not like such a slow speed. In Wardha they spin 132 rounds in half
an hour. 80 rounds are quite common. if you have people who are
experts in spinning on the takli, let them write to me about that art of
spinning. I have of course asked for the instructions from Wardha.
Instructions from two or three places would be more than sufficient. I
have acquired good speed in spinning on the charkha. I think I can
still improve.

make about my views concerning eggs, please do. I know definitely
that Pyarelal has not been transferred to Nasik. We shall meet again in
a day or two. Ascertain the position about Chitalia and pay him any
sum you think proper. We should not refuse to help him to face his
difficulties. Did you ask Chhaganlal Joshi? He may, perhaps, have180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIkept a note somewhere. Does he not live next to you? Also let me
know how he is. I am glad that Mirabehn has for the present dropped
her idea of going out of the Ashram. I have had no letter from
Devdas, whether long or short. Did he send it directly from jail, or in
some other manner? I will inquire about it here after I hear from you.
Ask Jivarambhai to write to me.
There was a note by Chandrakanta to the effect that a letter by
Kumarappa was included, but there was no such letter. Instead, there
was a letter from the Rev. Holmes. It is addressed C/o Kumarappa.
Kakasaheb thinks that that made Kanta say that there was a letter from
Kumarappa. Manilal has asked me for suggestions for reading. I must
have gone to sleep with this thought in my mind, and so I had the
following dream. My advice for reading is as in the dream which I am
narrating. I dreamt that Manilal was standing by my side and that
Devdas, a child, had climbed on to my lap and had fallen asleep.
Manilal told me that he had wasted many years of his life without
reading anything and that the desire for reading had now awakened in
him. He, therefore, asked me to guide him. I expressed my regret that
I had not been able to do much for my children’s education. I then
wrote down as follows for Manilal: “Study the whole of Gokhale’s
book on arithmetic. Study his books on algebra and geometry too, if
you get time. You should learn the history and geography of India in
some detail, and of the world in outline. You should read Tolstoy’s
The Kingdom of God Is within You , for Sanskrit Bhandarkar’s books
and the Gita, in Gujarati Navajivanmala  and K’s1 Jivanshodhan , and
finally Tulsidas’s Ramayana  and a text on. arithmetic, both in
Gujarati. You should get the books through Maganbhai.” At this
point I woke up from the dream. There was something more still, but I
do not recollect it. That is, I had forgotten it even when I woke up at
3.30 a.m. I like the advice I gave in my dream. Manilal may read what
he can, and what he finds interesting, from the above. Or, rather, it is
Mahadev who has awakened Manilal’s interest in reading. He should,
therefore, be guided by Mahadev. I should not hold on to an opinion
expressed in a dream; and, moreover, I cannot at present think out a
reading list for Manilal. I would give the same advice to Ramdas. I
attach no importance at all to the dream. Manilal’s problem was in my
mind. I had also been thinking about Devdas’s letter. It is not,
therefore, surprising that, owing to some disturbance in the stomach, I
1 K. G. Mashruwala’sVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 181got such a happy dream. Write to Brijkrishna and tell him that the
understanding is that, as far as possible, I should not write to prisoners
and hence I do not write to him. I think about him every day, all the
same. Tell him that he should take the utmost care of his health. He
should make the best use of every minute and keep note of how
hespends his time. Let him take this as a letter to him. And he should
continue to write to me.
Tuesday morning, October 28, 1930
I wrote about yajna last week, but feel like writing more about it.
It will perhaps be worthwhile further to consider a principle which has
been created along with mankind. Yajna is duty to be performed, or
service to be rendered, all the twenty-four hours of the day, and hence
a maxim like “The powers of the good are always exercised for a
benevolent purpose” is inappropriate, if benevolence has any taste of
favour about it. To serve without desire is to favour not others, but
ourselves even as in discharging a debt we serve only ourselves,
lighten our burden and fulfil our duty. Again, not only the good, but
all of us are bound to place our resources at the disposal of humanity.
And if such is the law, as evidently it is, indulgence ceases to hold a
place in life and gives way to renunciation. For human beings
renunciation itself is enjoyment. This is what differentiates man from
the beast. Some object that life thus understood becomes dull and
devoid of art, and leaves no room for the householder. But I think in
saying this they misinterpret the word ‘renunciation’. Renunciation
here does not mean abandoning the world and retiring into the forest.
The spirit of renunciation, should rule all the activities of life. A
householder does not cease to be one if he regards life as a duty
rather than as an indulgence. A cobbler, a cultivator, a tradesman or a
barber may be inspired in their work or activities either by the spirit of
renunciation or merely by the desire for self-indulgence. A merchant
who carries on his business in a spirit of sacrifice will have crores
passing through his hands, but he will, if he follows the law, use his
abilities for service. He will, therefore, not cheat or speculate, will lead
a simple life, will not injure a living soul and will lose millions rather
than harm anybody. Let no one run away with the idea that this type
of merchant exists only in my imagination. Fortunately for the world,
he does exist in the West as well as in the East. It is true such
merchants may be counted on one’s fingers but the type ceases to be182 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIimaginary as soon as even one living specimen can be found to
answer to it. All of us know of a philanthropic tailor in Wadhwan. I
know of one such barber. Everyone of us knows of such a weaver.1
And if we go deeply into the matter, we shall come across men in
every walk of life who lead dedicated lives.
No doubt these sacrificers obtain their livelihood by their
work. But livelihood is not their objective, but only a by-product of
their vocation. Motilal was a tailor at first, and continued as a tailor
afterwards. But his spirit was changed and his work was transmuted
into worship. He began to think about the welfare of others and his
life became artistic in the real sense of the term.
A life of sacrifice is the pinnacle of art and is full of true joy.
Such life is the source of ever fresh springs of joy which never dry up
and never satiate. Yajna is not yajna if one feels it to be burdensome
or annoying. Self-indulgence leads to destruction and renunciation to
immortality. Joy has no independent existence. It depends upon our
attitude to life. One man will enjoy theatrical scenery, another the ever
new scenes which unfold themselves in the sky. Joy, therefore, is a
matter of education. We shall delight in things which we have been
taught to delight in as children. And illustrations can be easily cited of
different national tastes.
Again, many sacrificers imagine that they are free to receive
from the people everything they need and many things they do not
need, because they are rendering disinterested service. Directly this
idea sways a man, he ceases to be a servant and becomes a tyrant over
the people. One who would serve others will not waste a thought upon
his own comforts, which he leaves to be attended to or neglected by
his Master on high. He will not, therefore, encumber himself with
everything that comes his way; he will take only what he strictly needs
and leave the rest. He will be calm, free from anger and unruffled in
mind even if he finds himself inconvenienced. His service, like virtue,
is its own reward, and he will rest content with it.
Again, one dare not be negligent in service or be behindhand
with it. He who thinks that he must be diligent only in his personal
business and unpaid public business may be done in any way and at
1 The allusion probably is to Kabir.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 183any time he chooses, has still to learn the very rudiments of the
science of sacrifice. Voluntary service of others demands the best of
which one is capable, and must take precedence over service of self. In
fact, the pure devotee consecrates himself to the service of humanity
without any reservation whatever.

DEAR SISTER,
The stock of uncarded cotton with me is about to be exhausted.
Till now, I used to get it from the Ashram. This time may I trouble
you? My hope in making this request is that, if you do not keep a
stock of such cotton, you will start doing so. The cotton should have
been ginned by hand. It is difficult to card with hand the cotton from
the bales prepared in a ginning press, and the yarn spun from such
cotton is not of good quality. If you do not keep a stock of such
cotton ginned by hand, you may obtain some from the Ashram or
from Vithaldas Jerajani. It may also be available in the Khadi
Karyalaya. I make this request so that you may take all this trouble.

MY DEAR KUMARAPPA,
I am glad you have expressed yourself freely on the question of
‘vows’.
You seem to me to misunderstand my meaning. No fault of
yours. You have not the original before you. I have not seen the
translation. The word ‘vow’ is also an unsuitable equivalent for the
original ‘ozr’. But the best thing for me is to explain what I mean and
then leave you to find the exact word if you endorse my position. If
you contest it, you should continue the correspondence till we have
thrashed the subject out.
You seem to think of vows publicly administered to audiences.
This may or may not be good. The ‘vow’ I am thinking of is a
promise made by one to oneself. We have to deal with two dwellers
within: Rama and Ravana, God and Satan, Ormuzd2 and Ahriman3 .
The one binds us to make us really free, the other only appears to free
us so as to bind us tight within his grip. A ‘vow’ is a promise made to
Rama to do or not to do a certain thing which, if good, we want to do,

we would avoid, but have not the strength to avoid unless similarly tied
down. This I hold to be a condition indispensable [to]1 growth. I grant
that we are higher than the sun, how much more necessary for us to be
at least as true and faithful as the sun if not truer and more faithful? If
in matters of commerce, a man who vacillates is useless, why should he
fare otherwise in matters spiritual which carry with them infinitely
greater consequences? If you hold that I must speak and do the right
thing at any cost, you grant my whole position and so you also do if
you grant that, at the peril of my life, I should be faithful to my wife
or friend. You can easily multiply such instances. For me Jesus was
pre-eminently a man of unshakable resolution, i.e., vows. His yea was
yea for ever. A life of vow is like marriage, a sacrament. It is marriage
with God indissoluble for all time. Come let us marry Him. Verb Sap .

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 1, 1930
CHI. JAYAPRAKASH,
I have your letter. I am glad. You are entitled to write as you do.
Your grief moves me. Your love for your mother3 is commendable
and becomes you. I enclose a letter to G.D. Birla.4 Take it to him
and see him. However, I must caution you. I myself have drunk deep
from the fountain of motherly love. I was devoted to my parents; I
worshipped them. And yet in your love for your mother I see
attachment. Your love should be informed with knowledge.Your
mother has died in the body. Her spirit has not perished. The body
had to perish one day. Your love should now undergo a
transformation. Our true mother is the motherland. Your filial love
should be transformed into love of the motherland and to make it
endure you should dedicate yourself to the service of the motherland.
You must not distress yourself that an expert doctor was not called.
Millions of mothers get no medical assistance. And I cannot admit
that they are thereby necessarily the losers. Even the best of doctors
cannot confer immortality on anyone. Therefore, in my view you and
everyone else should give expression to your filial love by dwelling
on the virtues of the departed and emulating them and you should
devote all your energies for the cause of the motherland. Please

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 2, 1930
CHI. KASHINATH,
I got your letter. If Shanta has been trying the bath cure, let me
know the effect it has. We had two copies of Kuhne’s book. I think
there is a Gujarati translation also. Kalavati had good experience of
life at home and it is also to the good that she is now returning of her
own accord.
Rukmini’s suicide excites deep pity. I think that there must have
been some other cause also behind this suicide. Has anybody
investigated the matter further? Has not the women’s group discussed
it? As the place is near Godhra, Mama is likely to know something. If
the report is correct, there should be widespread public agitation about
the case. If you get time, inquire further and let me know the result.
Who is the writer of the original letter? You cannot send me the Kashi
newspaper. But is it not clear enough, what he must have stated?

November 2, 1930
CHI. RADHIKA,
I have your letter. Read mine over and over and go on asking
me about what you do not understand in it. I preserve both my
self-respect and humility if, when someone kicks me and tries to force
me to salute him, I suffer the kicks but do not get angry and wish well
of the person kicking me, do not utter even one word in reply and still
refuse to salute him. Once a person kicked me and tried to force me
to sit at his feet, but I said nothing to him, never wished him ill even in
a dream, and yet refused to sit at his feet. I believe I had preserved
both self-respect and humility. When the incident took place, I was
notat all conscious that I was being humble or anything of the sort. I
narrate it now only in order to explain my meaning. You can think of
many similar situations. You may even recall some from your own
life, and it would be very good indeed if one formed the habit, and
learnt the art, of reflecting on such incidents in one’s own life rather
than in another’s. In doing so, one should not search for incidents in
one’s life which show one’s own virtues. Our virtues are for others to
see. We should try to discover our shortcomings.

We have received the letter you sent us. The telegram also

From this we should believe that he is destined for some great
achievement. At any rate such are the qualities of character we observe
in him at present. After consulting a doctor . . .2 I do feel that it would
be good if he becomes fit enough to be taken . . .3 to Almora or some
other place like that. Revashankerbhai’s Dhiru benefited much by
such a visit. His bone disease was even more serious than Manu’s.
Prabhudas also improved by staying there. Some defect seems to have
been left still in the ribs, etc. If it disappears completely, we may
perhaps rest somewhat free from fear.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 3, 1930
CHI. PANNALAL,
It is a good question you have raised. Exactly the same question
was raised formerly regarding Andhra. The decision arrived at in the
end was that we at any rate should try to produce in Gujarat the khadi
required for Gujarat. The same thing applies in the case of the Punjab.
The principle of local production is the very basis of the khadi
movement. Every province, every district and in fact every village
should produce the khadi which it needs. In the final analysis, the
difference in price between khadi and other cloth does not count.
Khadi will be dearer than mill cloth if people, though they understand
the principles of economics, do not spin to meet their own
requirements; if, none the less, they wear it for the sake of the poor,VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 195they would find khadi cheaper in the long run than other cloth. Think
over my definition of swadeshi. We have only one way open to us to
meet the difficulties which we now experience, and that is, to decide
the principle and then cling to it. For all that, private dealers are sure
to order khadi from the Punjab or other places. We will not obstruct
them. If you do not understand why this is the right course, you may
ask me again.

290. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
October 30/ November 4, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your packet today. The piece of leather which you sent for
the sandals was not good enough for repairing the soles. It is hardly a
month since the repair was done but the soles have again worn out.
The hard leather required for soles and heels is made from hide of a
particular part of the body, generally of a buffalo. If you get such a
piece, send it to me. In the alternative, you may send another pair of
the same number as, or of a number higher than, the one you sent for
Kakasaheb.
I think I wrote to you that you need not send the pair of scales.
If I did not, please understand from this that I don’t need it. Trivedi
came and gave me one.
I know your attitude. So long as Mahadev is outside, you will
not take upon yourself the burden of making a final decision, and
you are right in that. I had a long letter from Keshu. He seems to have
been deeply hurt. He has bitterly complained against you, but his
letter has had no effect on me. You should, however, take him into
confidence and ask him to tell you all that he feels. I know that he is
impulsive by nature. But he is a sincere youth and very eager to do
service. He is, however, impatient to increase his knowledge and do
original work. I may be wrong in my judgment about him. You
should, however, call him and hear all that he has to say. Afterwards
write to me and give me the impression you form. I know that he
1 The original was in Gujarati.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 199spends money rather freely. But I have observed that, in spite of that,
he is simple in habits. He adheres to his charge against . . .1 and it is a
serious one.
We need have no fears about Kanta and Sumangal. They are
close relations. They are first cousins and have grown up together.
Despite this, I, too, had a suspicion and expressed it to them. But I felt
that they were innocent. Sumangal was Kanta’s teacher once and she
has great faith in him. And, moreover, if we suspect brothers and
sisters, where would we end? We have adopted an attitude of full trust
in the women. If we burn our fingers as a result of that, we will endure
our misfortune. Unless we are prepared to take some risks, we shall
fail to do our duty towards women. The Hindu man is under a heavy
debt to the Hindu woman.
October 31, 1930
The clock struck nine when I wrote the last sentence and I laid
down the pen. We have resolved not to work after nine, as far as
possible.
I got your letter about Amidas. I am satisfied now. His
firmness will be rewarded. I felt that it was my duty to tell him what I
knew. If you want me to decide about Chitalia, I suggest that you
should send him Rs. 1,500. I think my speech referred to the past but
made no reference to the future. He cannot claim any money on the
basis of that speech. But I do not have sufficient data to come to a
decision on the point. I trust Karsandas and, since he has asked for the
sum, I think it is our duty to pay it. In future, however, he may draw
what he needs with Jamnalalji’s or Kishorelal’s consent; that seems all
right to me. Copy out this part of the letter and send it to
Karsandaswhen you remit the money to him. He should give his
opinion whether or not he agrees with me.
November 1, 1930
Along with this you will find letters to Prabhavati and
Jayaprakash and one to Ghanshyamdas about them. Put all the three
in the same envelope and dispatch them immediately. The couple is
passing through extremely difficult circumstances just now owing to
the death of Jayaprakash’s mother. Do the persons in the Ashram who
spin weigh the quantity of waste yarn? If they do not, they should start
1 The name has been omitted.200 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIweighing it every day. If anyone has been doing this, let me know the
quantity of yarn he or she wastes. What is the highest average speed
per hour attained by anyone in spinning? A person may, after careful
preparation, attain excellent speed on one occasion; but that does not
give the same value as the average speed maintained by someone who
has kept a record for a year. In calculating this, the time spent in
replacing a broken belt or in cleaning a belt should also be taken into
account. Don’t you agree that the figures given by a person would be
correct only if he has included in them the time spent thus?
Tuesday morning, November 4, 1930
We have discussed the Ashram observances, their necessity and
the meaning of yajna. I propose now to discuss the meaning of the
book, as I have understood it, on which we meditate daily and from
which we recite some portion every day so as to complete all the
chapters in a week, the book which we have accepted as our spiritual
lighthouse. A letter which I had once received had suggested this to
me, but Govindji’s letter received last week made me decide to take up
the subject. He says that he tries to read the Anasaktiyoga but finds it
very difficult to understand. Though I have tried to explain the
meaning of the verses in a language which everyone can understand, a
literal rendering is bound to present difficulties to the reader. If the
subject itself is difficult, how much can simplicity of language help? I,
therefore, intend here to present the subject itself in a manner easy to
follow. A book which we want to consult in every activity of our life
and with whose help we try to solve all our spiritual problems—if we
try again and again to understand the meaning of this book from all
possible points of view and meditate over it constantly, we shall
ultimately come to be filled with its spirit. In all my spiritual
difficulties I run to mother  Gita and to this day she has never failed to
comfort me. It is, therefore, not impossible that otherswho seek similar
comfort from her may, if they know what new light I get from it every
day, receive further help or see some altogether new meaning in the
work.
I propose today to give the substance of Chapter XII which
deals with bhakti. Whenever there is a wedding in the Ashram, we ask
the couple to learn by heart and ponder over this Chapter as one ofVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 201the five sacrifices they have to offer. Knowledge and action in the
absence of devotion are dry as dust and are likely to make us
confirmed bondslaves. Let us therefore commence this study of the
Gita with a heart full of devotion.1

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 6, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
Your letter. I do not think there is anything special about the
Gandiv I got. It gave all the trouble, you had, to Kaka. I found out the
cause of the trouble, removed it and it has never once given trouble.
The second mal must be as thin as possible. I am using what Narandas
sent from the Ashram. I think 6 threads. For the moving wheel the
mal knot should be from the outside. Neither need be too tight. The
wheel must move without any jerk. It may be that the metal rings are
not rigidly fixed in the wheels or the axles are not straight or in a
straight line. To me its beauty lies in its smooth working and less
liability to go out of order. But as I have said in my last letter, you
need not divert your attention for the sake of the wheel. I suppose it is
true about wheels as it is true about most things that what suits one
does not therefore suit all others. Experts have to adjust values of
different types. We workers must be satisfied with that which will give
the maximum of work with the minimum of trouble. If I had the
requisite mechanical training or was a genius in the art, I should love
to become an expert in carding and spinning and judging bows,
wheels and taklis. But I must treat it as a forbidden ambition, though I
do not leave off the search. The search for me here is duty Lo/keZ-
Long or short, I hope to do at least one bhajan daily. The
Marathi I finished with Kaka’s assistance. The Bengali too I began but
on learning from K. that they were all translated by the Poet himself
or under his supervision, I left off, thinking it a profanation even to
attempt. I have now, therefore, only 42 bhajans to do. Marathi being
very short, I was able to do sometimes even three per night. I hope to
finish before 42 days are out .
One question in your letter just now stares me about the Gandiv.
I mount the wheel end on a beam of wood nearly 3 inches high and I
fix it on to the beam with 2 movable pins. It thus lies slanting from
top downward. It can be even mounted on a box to lie flat. K. tied it
to the cane bottom of a chair and worked seated in a chair. I am glad
you saw Alexander. He wrote to me directly. The letter was givenVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 203to me about 10 days after its receipt. I knew from him that he was able
quite by accident to see you. When you write to him please give him
my love and tell him I had his letter. I must not attempt to write
separately to him. Sufficient unto the day is the good thereof.
Love.

CHI. MIRA,
Your letter. I am glad you are feeling yourself again. Please do
not feel bound to try the Gandiv wheel. I know you have many things
to attend to and with a regularly going wheel, you might be able to
finish your sacrificial spinning without any bother.
Give Andrews my love. I can write a formal letter to him. But I
do not want to write a mere formal letter to him. I would far rather let
my silence speak to him. The pen is often a superfluity, if not a
hindrance, to heart’s flow.
Mahadeo must not overstrain himself. I have written to him
strongly about him, but you should pull him up whenever he is
reckless about his health. My cold had disappeared altogether and,
therefore, I did not even think of it when I wrote to you last week. Yes,
just now it is a combination of dates and vegetables, the latter
sparingly. But for the cold, I was getting on all right with the
vegetables. I may not give you more time this week.

I have your letter. Though Manilal has lost 40 Ib., he seems to
have preserved his strength, for he has asked my advice about what to
read. Pragji’s request regarding the Phoenix Ashram seems
reasonable to me. However, it is for Manilal and you to decide about
the matter. Moreover, I do not have even enough facts to arrive at a
decision. Secondly, it is the common experience that, in such matters,
only the person who held charge last can give the right decision. Even
if Bharati’s handwriting is bad, she should write. Why should one feel
ashamed to write to a friend? I must ask Krishnakant to forgive me. I
don’t even remember his face. I have of course heard his name from
you and read it in your letters. Won’t he forgive me if I send him
heaps of blessings? Ask him. If he does not forgive me, plead on my
behalf. Can you say that Sita has now become as strong as she was in
South Africa? Do you give her fruit to eat? Convey my blessings to
Pragji and write to him and tell him that service lies in doing the
dutywhich comes to us unsought. Who are now with Gomati? What

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 7, 1930
CHI. BHAGWANJI,
I have your letter. You will realize truth more and more as you
will stop observing what others do and concentrate on your work. Nor
should you plunge too much into thinking. Of course one has to
think up to a point. After that one should depend only on faith. The
mind too like the body suffers from indigestion when overstuffed.
Like the body the mind too needs to be put at rest. That is why there
has been enjoined constant repetition of Ramanama and other
mantras. They instantly put the mind to rest. Now the meaning: The
higher and the lower [para and apara] means, so to say, the
unmanifest and the manifest. The  Gita often discusses them. Let us
understand it briefly as the Lord (Ishwar) or Brahman or even Truth.
Self-evident truth is the higher and the other realized by an individual
is therefore finite: [i.e.,] lower. A person who has a glimpse of (this
aspect of) the Lord in His higher form is relieved from the good or
bad fruit of his actions and all his problems and misgivings disappear.
The Gita II. 59, viz., ‘the yearning too departs when he beholds the
Supreme’ also conveys the same sense. A person who becomes
engrossed in discharging whatever duty naturally comes to his lot, has
as good as realized the para1 and this ought to put an end to his
problems. He who cannot experience it has not [yet] identified

CHI. BALI,
I got a letter from you after many days. You may keep Manu
with you and let her live as you wish and as may please Ba. I don’t
wish at all to hurt you and your sister, and at any rate I would not do
so from here. I know the great love that you two have for the children.
Do not worry about Kanti. He is a brave boy and God, the Lord of us
all, protects everyone. You may see him whenever you get an
opportunity and you should afterwards write to me and give me news
about him. I do occasionally have news about him, of course, from
other sources.

I got your letter. I was happy to read it. Besides rotla, what else
does Mathuradas eat? Does he take milk, fruit, etc.? Does he get any
food from outside or does he eat only what he gets in jail? Is there
space where he can walk a little? Does he have the strength to do it?
Does he have any companion with him? Get all this information and
write to me. Pyarelal is quite well. I also had a letter from Shankaran.
When he comes to see you next, tell him that I had replied to his letter.
Does Dilip get sufficient exercise? Do you take regular walks, too? If
you do not, you should. If you have started reading anything, let me
know what it is.

BHAI NANABHAI,
I read your remarks below Tara’s letter. What you have been
doing is enough. If a person three feet in height feels unhappy
because he cannot reach with his hand as high as a man six-foot tall
can do, he condemns the Creator of the world. He who does his duty
with love and devotion for God and to the best of his ability,
discharges his debt fully. I believe that you do this. Why, then, should
you feel discontented or unhappy? You should, of course, try and
find out why your body is so weak. But it seems that all of you
brothers have weak constitutions from your birth. You should
discover the cause and if, in your own case, there is no remedy, you
should remove it in respect of persons under your care.

I have your letter. It would be nice if Prabhudas wrote about the
science of weaving. I cannot suggest anything right now about
spinning, etc. Discuss it with Kaka when he is released. I have talked to
him mainly about these subjects. He has become quite familiar with
the difficulties faced by the spinners.
Have you come across any spinning-wheels that deserve to be
given a prize at first sight ? If so, we must appoint an examiner and
finish that work. Amubhai and Mathuradas are qualified for it. You
have to be connected with it of course. I suggest that Purushottam and
Kesu of Jeevan-chakra  should be taken as advisers. If Annada Babu
has studied the science of the spinning-wheel, he too should be taken
as an examiner. I cannot think of other names at the moment.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 213 Prabha Devi1 wrote to me about Tarini2. Satis Babu has been

I have your letter. Go and see Devakinandan’s spinning-wheel.
The name Savyasachi4 is of course too high-sounding for your
spinning-wheel. ‘Bharat’ will not do either. Since, however, you
reminded5 me of Maganlal, I have suggested his name for your
spinning-wheel. It was he who transformed spinning-work into a
science. That name, therefore, is not improper for your spinning-
wheel. ‘Magan’ means ‘roominess’ and also ‘pleasure’. It is your
claim that your spinning-wheel gives people pleasure . And finally,
Maganlal had the virtues of Bharat6 and Bharat was his ideal. Your
purpose7 also will therefore be served. After this, you may adopt
whatever name you like. If Bhavanidutta is a fit person, you should
take him in. You should not say ‘such a one’ with reference to any
person. If Bhavanidutta does come, you should provide him food and
drink at least.

BHAI BUDHABHAI,
I received your letter. Practice writing with ink. Writing with a
pencil is a form of violence to the reader. Of course, when writing with
a pencil cannot be avoided, one is helpless.
A fast is not a substitute for eating less. A fast by itself
sometimes involves eating too much . The right way of ensuring that
you eat less is that at every meal, you should ask them to serve you
only once, and that too, only in a small quantity. Never eat so much
that your hunger may be fully satisfied. Stop eating as soon as you
feel that you have eaten so much as would permit you to eat the same
quantity again. As long as you have not accustomed yourself to eating
sparingly, it would be desirable not to insist on eating only five articles
of food at one meal. Eating sparingly will by itself mean that you eat
only a few articles of food at a time. You may take salt in reasonable
quantity. If you settle down at one place, why should you not grow in
the yard some vegetables which would take only a short time to grow?
For instance, you could grow fenugreek leaves.

DEAR DAUGHTER RAIHANA,
I have your letter. I was very glad.1
Shouldn’t you regard this much Urdu enough for the day? If,
even after your second lesson I do not write a few lines in Urdu, you
might give me up as an unteachable pupil. What should I do then? If
you don’t have to spend too much time and take too much trouble in
writing Urdu so neatly, continue to write to me in Urdu. That would
help me to keep up some Urdu without special effort. You are all free
to laugh as much as you wish at my bad handwriting and at

But I must say that there is no limit to your cunning. I don’t
know where you learnt it. I certainly do not remember to have taught
that. The poor girl! As soon as I permit her to write in Urdu, she goes

This time, too, I got your packet in two parts, first the English
letters and then on the next day the others. There was also a previous
occasion when this happened. They open the packet and look into the
letters, hurriedly or carefully as they feel inclined before they hand
them over to me. They are of course required to read the letters. The

any rate as early as possible.
I had again a long letter from Keshu. I find much substance in
what he says. He has gone deep into the matter. I have formed the
impression that . . .1 is hiding something. Read my letter to Keshu and
to . . .2 before you pass them on. I have asked him what he thinks
about Keshu. I think his unpunctuality and other shortcomings are
such as we can tolerate. Being sincere, he does not want to make a
false show. He refuses to do anything which is beyond his capacity or
which does not appeal to him. But he has certainly the spirit of service
in him. Since he is pure at heart, I think it is our duty to bear his
minor faults. But Mahadev is there now and he says that he will abide
by Mahadev’s decision. If Mahadev cannot settle the matter, in the last
resort I will do so.
What you say about Hari-ichchha is correct. If you cannot stop
the marriage from taking place in the Ashram, put up with the event. I
had indeed guessed about it and that is why I put that question to
Harilal in my letter to him.
Did you read the further details about speed in spinning on the
takli which Balkrishna gave in his letter this time? It is increasing
there. I count the attainment of this speed a very important
achievement. I remember that four years ago a speed of hundred
rounds per hour was considered excellent. Now 160 rounds is the
standard for passing, according to Vinoba. Gangabehn has under-
taken a big task. But God  has always blessed her undertakings with
success. Don’t mind if Kusum has gone. Who will now help you
personally? I am sure you will feel hard pressed for want of enough
workers to help you. Owing to so many hands having left, the burden
of work is likely to increase rather than diminish. Who will take
Kanta’s place? Send me a final list of all the women who leave.
I approve of your diet. If it suits you, it is almost an ideal
combination. Do not increase the quantity of ground-nuts and do not
eat ground-nuts and copra on the same day. The quantity of milk
must not decrease now. Half a pound is the minimum you should
take. It is Dr. Muthu’s view that that quantity supplies the necessary
vitamins. If you feel weak, increase the quantity of milk or curds.

I don’t see any substance in Mathew’s suspicion. Read my reply

I must get now a strong piece of leather for the soles or a new

to get them!

Does anyone go and visit Somabhai and others who are in jail? I
know that it is difficult to visit such a large number. But you should
select those who are likely to be visited by nobody else. It would be
good if you could make some arrangement for visiting such
prisoners.
Prabhavati gets no Gujarati papers at all. We regularly
receive Mumbai Samachar and other papers, and out of these you
should send one or two to her. She wrote to me about this once or
twice but I forgot to mention it in my letters. I had a separate letter
from . . .2 yesterday. Before I could write to him the letter which I
wished to do, I had this letter of repentance from him and so the reply
which I have given to him is altogether different from what it would
otherwise have been. The impression I have formed from his letter is
that he is still hiding much. You will understand this if you read my

CHI. SURENDRA (OF VIDYAPITH),
I got your letter. You need not feel worried. The disease from
which you suffer is quite common these days. If you take nutmeg,
take only a pinch of it daily. But the real remedy is mental. You
should always keep your body and mind fully occupied. Never
remain in a place where you are alone. You should eat simple food,
and at fixed hours. If you stand it, you should bathe in cold water.
You may live in the Ashram, if you feel happy there, or go to Wardha.
I think you will probably feel uncomfortable at Wardha. If you prefer
to go to the Ashram, Narandas will call you up there. Don’t worry at
all. I will certainly write to you frequently. You should write freely to
me. More in the next letter.

BHAISHRI KHAMBHATTA,
I have your letter. I have tried the Jivan spinning-wheel. It works
quite well but at present I am experimenting on the Gandiv wheel. The
Jivan wheel is used by Kakasaheb. He finds it quite convenient to spin
on it, whereas he did not on the Gandiv wheel. Personally, I have
fallen in love with the latter for its simplicity and low cost. However, I
can give no final opinion yet. Why cannot you experiment with a milk
diet in Bombay? There is no risk at all in doing so. Probably curds
will agree better than milk. If the palate is no problem with you, I
would advise you to try the experiment of a milk diet immediately. It
will certainly do you no harm; it provides sufficient nourishment.

328. LETTER TO MIRABEHN
YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 13, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
Your letter. The arrangement about translating my remarks on
the Gita chapters is quite good. I shall look forward to the joint
handiwork. I want to pour myself out into those chapters. ThisVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 225means additional work for you and will take up a great deal of your
time. However, I know you won’t feel the strain of it, as you love that
work.
Here is a letter from Andrews, this time, for me to send you. He
could not restrain himself from writing to me directly. I have at last
given him a few lines. Don’t give any time to the Gandiv till Keshu
has obtained mastery over it and gives you a machine in working
order. For me it continues to provide  further delights. The original
mal for the motor wheel at last had to be discarded, as I could not cut
it any further for tightening it. It has to be fairly stout and thick. I had
nothing with me in the hand-spun mals of the required thickness. As
you know, I criminally neglected to learn how to make these little
odds and ends. And I was bent on having only the hand-spun stuff. I
had to give full two hours to the first attempt. It was successful and
was possible only because only a short length was required. My
second attempt took me barely half an hour. I had to make another
for emergency, which occurred at once, for the original threads from
which I made the mal were weak. I have now thought of a device of
quickly twisting to the required strength practically any number of
threads. My third attempt will therefore mean still less time. And
meantime I am having now an accumulation of little bits of stout
hand-spun chords which I can use for watchguards and the like. All
this gives me delight and comfort, for it means greater mastery over
the wheel. And this has become so easily possible because of the
incredible simplicity of the Gandiv. But I am not going to regard my
opinion as final or authoritative till I have corroboration from
someone who knows much more than I do of the mechanism of the
charkha. But I warn you against regarding this detailed description as
any incentive for you to tackle the Gandiv. I know if I was outside, I
could not have given all this time, thought and attention to the thing.
It might not have even been desirable if it was to exclude other urgent
matters. I have given you the details merely to share my joy with you.
The charkha, the takli and the bow have become a fascination with
me. I do not seem to get tired of them. Daily I wish I had more time
to give to these things. I want to secure greater output on all the three.
But I am so clumsy and so stupid and slow. Somehow or other I feel
that it is not the rigidity of old age that prevents from gaining a
greater output. I have not the proper knack I fear. However I find
satisfaction from the knowledge that God will accept this little offering226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIas the best possible for me in the circumstances. If you can stand the
cold bath in winter, nothing can be more bracing. You will not strive
against nature. If there is no instantaneous warm reaction, you must
revert to the warm bath. The condition of reaction is vigorous rubbing
with the bare hands. I had sorrowfully to give up cold baths only after
that wretched attack of pleurisy in London in 1914. Your food is
quite good. It may be necessary to take more ghee. Experience has
shown that you need a fair measure to keep strength, heat and weight.
Gangadevi may walk a little. She must take measured steps and
begin with a few minutes only at a time. All risk of a setback should
be avoided. She will get rid of the urinary trouble by taking a
hip-bath. If the water is chilly a little hot water may be added to take
the chill off. This hip-bath is almost an infallible remedy.
Is not this uncle, who has married, somewhat elderly and who
vies with you in indifferent spellings, though very learned?
So according to your birthdate, you are only a babe a few
months old!! You have therefore many a summer to look forward to.
Love.

CHI. SHARDA,
Your letter. Continue to have sun-bath and oil-massage. While
spinning on the takli, the thread should never snap. I could not under-
stand your saying that there is little waste on the spinning-wheel. If
you tell me the amount of waste in a given number of rounds of a
particular count I would understand it. Calculate it this way. There is
another way also. Find out how often you pulled out the yarn and
how often it snapped in the course of half an hour. Is it clear to you
that there is a difference between calculating the waste and [the
frequency of snapping]? If you have understood this, write to me what
this difference is.

CHI. VASUMATI,
I have your insipid letter. How is it that, though participating in
such a great revolution, you could not think of anything to write
about? It is possible, of course, that the mind may be stunned by the
great changes taking place and reason may stop working; if so, one
cannot think of anything to write about. At such a time, one’s mind
may be wholly absorbed in work and can think about nothing else. If
you are in such a sublime state of mind, I have nothing to say. I would
then be satisfied even with a letter to this effect: “Bapu, everything is
going well. Vasumati.”

331. FRAGMENT OF LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAI1
November 13, 1930
I also see an error of principle in what you say regarding
spinning and French. Having dedicated yourself completely to
spinning, you cannot do anything else for your personal benefit while
spinning. If somebody comes for a chat with you, you may talk with
him for the sake of good manners. But you cannot argue that, instead
of his taking up your time in talking, he may as well teach you
French. You may, if you so wish, escape from the necessity of having
to talk to him, and he also will not go on talking just in order that he
may stay longer. But once he has agreed to be your teacher, he is
bound to sit with you sufficiently long. All this has reference to the
time when we are spinning for yajna. I have been realizing the force
of this argument in my own experience. If, while I am spinning, I start
thinking about other things, the speed of spinning and the count and
1 The source does not mention the addressee. But in “Letter to Narandas
Gandhi”, 13/17-11-1930 where Gandhiji discusses spinning as yajna he asks Naran-
das to “understand” what he has said on the subject in his letter to Mahadev Desai.
Presumably this is the letter.228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIevenness of spinning are adversely affected. Imagine Romain Rolland
or Beethoven playing on the piano. They would be so absorbed in the
music that they would neither be able to talk with anyone nor think
about anything else. An artist is not apart from his art. If this is true in
regard to the music of the piano, how much more so must it be
regarding the spinning- yajna? It may be true that, as we are today, we
cannot act in this spirit but that is another matter. If we keep our ideal
pure, we are bound to succeed one day in putting it into practice. Let
me repeat that I am not criticizing what has happened. Pitifully
imperfect myself, what right have I to criticize anybody? Do I put into
practice all that I know to be true? If I had done that, the seven lakh
villages would have been filled with the sweet music of the
spinning-wheel long before now. If even now I could live perfectly in
conformity with what I know to be right, the cult of the
spinning-wheel would spread fast all over the country though I am
here in jail. “Though the aspiration is beyond my strength at present,
the mind is set firmly on it. If God so decrees, I shall become the
essence of light.” (Plagiarizedfrom Raychandbhai, with apologies to
him) I shall tire of praising the 33music of the spinning-wheel when
Malaviyaji does of praising the Bhagavata  Purana. We cannot, of
course, speak of a spinning-wheel Purana. It will be for those who
come after us to compose a Purana and they will do so if we have
achieved anything which can be a worthy theme. Just now, we are
composing a few tunes of the spinning-wheel music. How great the
music will be which ultimately results from them, will depend on our
tapascharya  and the measure of our self-dedication. . . .1
. . . I shall now dwell further on the argument of the previous
letter.
I think the ideal is that we should observe complete silence when
engaged in the spinning- yajna, and think exclusively about spinning,
that is, khadi or go on repeating Ramanama. We should, of course,
understand Ramanama in a wide sense. Really speaking, we should go
on repeating Ramanama silently to ourselves all the time, whether or
not we consciously utter it with our lips. It should be the unvarying
accompaniment to all our thoughts and activities, like the tune on the
tamboora  in a musical recital. When, however, our attention is not
1 Omission as in the source. What follows seems to have been taken from a
subsequent letter.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 229wholly absorbed in the work which we are doing, we should
consciously go on repeating Ramanama. While spinning, we generally
talk with somebody or listen to what people tell us or do some other
work. This kind of spinning is certainly not yajna. If the yajna of
spinning is a sacred obligation, the time which we give to it should be
wholly dedicated to it. He who lives his life in the spirit of yajna and
works without attachment will always be engaged in one task at a time.
Though I know this well enough, I was the first to sin (be it more or
less) in this respect, for it can be said that I never sat down in a
secluded spot to spin quietly, that is, in complete silence. On my
silence days, while spinning I either used to hear the mail being read
out to me or listened to what people wanted to tell me. Even here I
have not given up that bad habit. Is it any wonder, then, that though I
spin regularly I have made no progress at all in the field and have
barely acquired the speed of 200 rounds an hour? I see in myself
many other deficiencies, besides this; for instance, while I am spinning
the thread snaps, I do not know how to make a belt, know very little
about spindle-holders, cannot tell the quality of cotton, cannot as
certain with precision the evenness of the thread and cannot judge the
quality of the fibre. Does this befit one who claims to do spinning as
yajna? Is it then surprising that the progress of khadi should be slow?
If God is in truth God of the poor, and certainly He is that, and if
khadi is the symbol of His grace, then I am the oracle, or what you
will, who proclaimed this truth, and yet how slack have I been in
putting into practice my own teaching! I, therefore, never feel tempted
to criticize anybody else in this matter. I am only trying to describe to
you my own deficiency in this regard and my pain, and the
self-understanding and knowledge which result from that pain.
Though I have occasionally expressed such sentiments while talking
with Kaka, you are the first person to whom I have expressed them so
clearly, and I got the opportunity to do this because you combined
the study of French with spinning. Let me repeat that I see no fault on
your part in having done that. On the contrary, I see what an
imperfect preacher of the mantra of spinning I have been. I knew the
mantra but did not observe its ritual perfectly, and, therefore, it failed
to reveal its full power. Apply to all activities in life the argument
which I have applied here to spinning. You will then be able to feel in230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIyour imagination the wonderful peace and sense of fulfilment which
we can experience in our life. This is the meaning of the verse, “Yoga
is skill in work”.1 If we cultivate this attitude, we shall attempt only
what is within our capacity to do and shall rest content with it. I am
convinced that by working in this spirit we shall have contributed most
to our own development and that of society. But all this will be mere
philosophizing if I myself do not follow it in practice in everything I
do. I am certainly making progress day by day in my effort to do so.
What will happen when I am released, God alone knows. If possible,
observe this at least in practice. Spin in this systematic manner the
number of rounds which you regard as your daily contribution to the
spinning- yajna. You may spin the rest in any manner that you can,
for the purpose of increasing the country’s wealth. I feel tempted to
go on writing still further. But I think I should stop here.

father who, though old, is getting younger day by day? In the West
people communicate by means of wires, and transmit images too. I

white-bearded but bursting with hearty laughter, and I hear the man
telling the reporter: “I shall be back in the guest-house within three

that I don’t have a pocket. The old man has played his part

340. LETTER TO GANGABEHN VAIDYA
November 14, 1930
CHI. GANGABEHN,
Your letter to Kakasaheb was received late. I understood the
situation better from it. People certainly give you credit. But exercise
the utmost patience. You have taken upon yourself a great
responsibility. But you should meditate over those three verses which
we have recently included in the prayers. Those who work for God
with His name ever on their lips, He makes them His special concern
and ensures the success of their undertakings, and it is He who guides
them; why, then, should we worry?
Padma seems to have got fever. She has a swelling too. If you
cannot judge what to do to cure her, get her examined by Haribhai. If
you can judge what to do, don’t be afraid to apply any treatment you
think best. Even when doing that, you should feel that you are guided
by God and take measures which seem best at the moment; having
done that, you should rest completely free from worry. Do not take
upon yourself a burden beyond your strength to carry.
Man has ill-treated woman and is still doing so. But the remedy
for this ultimately lies in woman’s own hand. If she stops thinkingVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 235that she is weak, she can be free this very day. The really strong are
not those who are strong in body. Ravana, who was a demon, that is,
had physical strength, was helpless before the seemingly weak Sita. I
am sure you remember the story. Sita was under the protection of a
boon to the effect that anyone who cast an evil glance at her would be
instantly burnt to ashes. Ravana knew this and that is why, though he
carried her away, he could not touch her person with impure thoughts.
He had to entreat Sita to let him embrace her. He threatened her time
and again in the hope that she might yield; but unless she yielded of
her own free will he was, in spite of his strength, as helpless as a goat.
Though physically Sita was utterly helpless, in spirit she was a lioness.
We know the meaning of a boon. It is only a symbol. Every
woman who has inviolable purity of character enjoys the same boon
as Sita did. Any man who casts an evil glance at such a woman would
be instantly burnt to ashes. If man hasill-treated woman, the reason is
that she, too, has yielded to lust. Being enslaved by passion, both
forgot their higher nature, forgot that they were souls and remained
mere bodies. So far as the body is concerned, man is undoubtedly the
stronger of the two. Hence woman was enslaved by man and the
impression came to prevail that she was helpless before man, that she
was weak and always needed man’s protection.
As souls man and woman are equal. If a man does not recognize
his spiritual nature but a woman does, the latter is the stronger of the
two, as Sita was stronger than Ravana, and the other remains weaker, as
was Ravana. Don’t believe, moreover, that this was possible only in the
time of Rama. Even today there are countless Sitas in the world who
require no man’s help and are yet safe against all danger. One such is
Janakimaiya. You must have seen her. Whenever I went to Bombay,
she came and saw me. She had not much intellectual capacity to speak
of, but had boundless strength of spirit. She must have been
good-looking in her youth. She embraced a hard path of service in
the prime of her youth. I have known other Indian women like her,
and also Englishwomen. They are examples of but a small measure of
spiritual strength. A woman who has fully grown in soul deserves to
be revered as the world’s mother.
For those who wish to cultivate such strength, satyayuga  exists
today. Your task, therefore, is to make women strong. That is the right
method of securing justice from men. A man like me may guide you236 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIand awaken other men to a consciousness of their duty. But my
capacity for serving women is limited.
Women alone can serve women perfectly. It is my ambition,
through the Ashram, to prepare not one such worker but many. An
opportunity to do so has presented itself to us just now.
If you have not followed this, ask me to explain again.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 15, 1930
CHI. PREMA,
I got your letter. You certainly did well in consulting a doctor.
But I cling to the cure I have suggested. You may, if you wish, carry
out the doctor’s treatment afterwards. Fast for at least seven days
before you do anything else. We should never be afraid of fasting.
During a seven-day fast, you will be able to attend to almost all your
work. When I first undertook a long fast, I did not rest for a single day
and experienced no difficulty on that account. It was a seven-day fast.
At that time, I did have some fat on my body. Only a person who has
no reserve of fat is forced to lie down during a fast. After two days of
fasting, you will actually feel stronger. For two days, you may get a
feeling of being hungry, but it will disappear after that and real
hunger will return when the blood has been purified. Till that time,
you should take an enema every day and keep the bowels clean. If,
after taking the enema, you remain in the ardha sarvangasan  posture,
the water may even reach the large intestine. You may omit this,
however, if you do not know how to do it. During the fast, you should
drink plenty of water with soda bicarb and salt mixed in it. You may
mix five grains of salt and ten grains of soda in every eight ounces of
water and may safely drink up to eight cups of such water. You
should also take sun-bath. I should like you to do this without any
fear in your mind. You may tell the doctor about it, if you wish.
Probably he, too, will approve of this cure. Many doctors now know
about the miraculous effects of fasts.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 16, 1930
MY DEAR KUMARAPPA,
If a man makes an unalterable decision to do or not to do a
particular thing, it is for me a vow. The strongest men have been
known at times to have become weak. God has a way of confounding
us in our strength. Hence the necessity of vows, i.e., invoking God’s
assistance to give us strength at the crucial moment. But I must not
strive with you. It seems to me that we mean the same thing but
express it differently—you in Spanish and I in Italian, shall we say?
Love.

I have just got a letter for the first time from Manilal. He in-
forms me that he keeps very good health. He has lost not 40 Ib. but
22 lb. Even that is a lot. But he seems to be very cheerful, and has also
been reading a great deal. God has given him the strength to live in all
circumstances. Moreover, he is simple at heart and so God alwaysVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 241protects him. Probably you know all this, but the more often you hear
the same thing the happier you will feel. Write to me regularly. Coax

of them at the proper time. Just now, however, in devoting oneself
whole-heartedly to the work one has taken up lies the pursuit of

now it will not be even two weeks before he is released. Your

1 Bapubhai DhruvaVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 245358. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
4.30 a.m. November 13/17, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
They sent me your packet at 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, that is,
yesterday.
The devotee “renounces all undertakings”.1 This means the
devotee will not draw up schemes of future expansion. For example, if
a merchant who deals in cloth now has any plans of selling firewood
as well in the future, or if he, having one shop only, thinks of opening
five more shops, that would be arambha  (undertaking) on his part,
and the devotee will have none of it. This principle is applicable to
service of the nation as well. For instance, a worker in the khadi
department today will not take up cow-keeping tomorrow, agriculture
the day after and medical aid on the fourth day. He will do his best in
whatever has come to him. When I am free from egoism, nothing
remains for me to do.
‘The Lord has bound me with a cotton thread; I am His, no
matter where He leads me. I have been stabbed with the dagger of
love.’ A devotee’s every activity is planned by God. It comes to him
as in the natural course of things. He therefore rests content with,‘this,
that or anything else’ (ØðÙ ·ð¤Ùç¿Ì÷ï |) This is the meaning of
‘reonouncing all undertakings’. The devotee does not cease to work;
indeed he is nothing if not a worker. He only ceases to think needless
thoughts about his work. It is these that he hat to renounce.
‘This has been acquired by me today; that purpose I shall gain
tomorrow’2 —this is the opposite of ‘renouncing undertakings’.
I think this answers your question fully. Ask me if anything is
left out. Keep this portion with the discussion which is proceeding.
If, along with the new pair of sandals, you have not sent a piece
of leather for repairing the soles, and if you can get such a piece and
send it, with someone who may be coming on a visit here, please do
send it, or send it by sample post provided it does not cost much, so
that I can use when necessary even the worn-out sandals.
Write to Jamnalal and tell him that I wish him success in his holy
1 Vide “Letters on the Gita”, 21-2-1932.
2 Bhagavad Gita, XVI. 13246 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIresolves. A time will come when he will not haw to plan undertakings
in this fashion. God will load him with tasks of service one after
another. He will not have to plan for them or seek them. Just now, his
planning for them is all right. From this he will come to taste the joy
of bhakti. So long as there are no rains, we have no choice but to exert
ourselves and draw water from wells, rivers, streams, etc. But, when the
clouds burst in the sky and we have the Ganga flowing at our
doorstep, what else need we do then? I think the work he could do in
Nasik would have been beyond the capacity of anyone else. All the
same, it would be good if others, too, tried. In my own case, I have to
content myself with a sincere effort, and I apply to others the same
yardstick as I do to me. I can say or write much more about this, but
all that can wait till we meet. As for what the heart feels and wishes to
convey, I have set it down above. This for Jamnalal.
I have written to you about . . . 1. It is but right that none of us is
satisfied with his confession. The evil in his heart is deep. I have of
course written strongly to him. I suppose all of you must have
expressed your dissatisfaction to him. So long as we are not satisfied
about his purity, we cannot ask him to do any public service. He
himself may do it on his own in the spirit of sacrifice. You may act in
this matter as you think best.We need not be angry with him. We
should act as love may prompt us to do. It is only the person on the
spot who can realize what love requires him to do in certain
circumstances. From a distance one can send no instructions about
that.

Tell Manilal that the letter I received this time is the only one I
have had from him. I did not receive his earlier letters. If he did write
any, how did he send them, that is, with whom? I will inquire if I get
definite information. If he is eager to have letters from me, I too wish
to write to him. But I have a general understanding with the officials
that I would not write to prisoners, and I abide by it. I enjoy
sufficiently good freedom in other respects in the matter of writing
letters and so I do not quarrel with them unnecessarily for further
concessions. When our attitude is that we should be content in jail
even if they do not permit us to write any letter at all, we ought not to
quarrel on such grounds. Even so, we do send messages. Manilal,
1 The name has been omitted.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 247however, should write as often as he is permitted to do. I have already
written to you about his studies and he must have got the message. His
present programme of reading is good enough. But the plan which I
have suggested seems to me methodical and complete. If, therefore, he
can take interest in those books, he should follow that plan. Sushila
wrote to me saying that he had lost 40 Ib. in weight. I suppose that
was an error. Or did he really lose as much as that at any time? Has he
now been recovering it or has the reduction come to stay? How about
his strength? He is right in his view about Phoenix. If the paper is
running at a loss, they should close it. Ask Manilal to write to that
effect. I, too, will write, when I am permitted to do so. I had a letter
from Pragji. The Headman has just gone out and will decide what
reply to give after he returns. Meanwhile you can write to him and tell
him that I think Pragji ought to get all the powers which he asks for.
I am awaiting your reply regarding the letter which Devdas
wrote to me.
You will find something about spinning in the letter to
Mirabehn. I will write to her tomorrow. You will find something more
important still in the letter to Mahadev,1 which I want all of you to
understand. To spin by way of yajna and to take up spinning as
labour in order merely to add that much to one’s earning are
twodifferent things. In yajna, the actual work, though extremely
important, is of secondary value. In spinning undertaken as labour,
the actual work is all that matters. Irrespective of whether it is anything
more than that, even as work it bears fruit. In doing anything as yajna
one is not concerned with the fruit of one’s labour and, therefore, the
fruit is immeasurable. That is, yajna completely fulfils one’s
cherished desires. In performing such a yajna, one must lose oneself
in one’s work. By doing that one learns the science and art of
working. Anyone, therefore, who would work in the spirit of yajna
should have such qualities as purity of heart, etc., and should do his
sacrificial work with single-minded devotion. He would not even think
about anything else when working. A worker inspired with such spirit
of sacrifice should have mastered all that is known about the science
of spinning and should be daily adding to the existing knowledge. If
a peson who has voluntarily embraced the path of sacrifice has made
mistakes through negligence or want of means or for any other
reason, he should have the strength to rectify them as and when he
1 Vide”Fragment of Letter to Mahadev Desai”, 3-11-1930.248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdetects them. I use the word ‘spinning’ here in a symbolical sense. It
stands for proficiency in all the processes relating to cotton. You will
think this a big task, which it is and is not. It is not a big or difficult
task for those who have recognized its necessity, for they will be
making some progress every day towards mastery of these processes
and will grow in purity of heart day by day. A person who works in
the spirit of sacrifice will be a lover of truth and will, therefore, after
he has realized the necessity of working in this spirit, go on
voluntarily increasing his knowledge and proficiency without having
to make a strenuous effort. Even if he has to do so, he will look upon
that as God’s grace and not a hardship. I feel, therefore, that all of us
should adopt the method which. I have explained in a previous letter
and understand this deeper and truer meaning of yajna. I have
explained sufficiently clearly in my letter to Mahadev how much I
myself am to blame for our failure to understand this and put it into
practice.
5 o’clock, November 16, 1930
I forgot to tell you in my last letter about Kakasaheb’s
suggestion to reduce exactly by half the time for completing once the
devotional reading of the Gita. You must have read about it if you saw
the letter to Vinoba. I forgot to tell you that you should read that
letter. His suggestion is that we shall be conforming better to the
tradition if we complete one reading in a week. Anyone who wants
tojoin in the middle of a week will not then have to think how far
the reading must have progressed. Every week you will be reciting the
same verses on a particular day. If we complete the reading in a
fortnight, the verses read on a particular day of the week change from
week to week. It is true that completing it in a week means twice as
much time every day. If we read through the whole of the Gita at one
time, we would take an hour and a quarter or an hour and a half. At
the rate of an hour and a half for the whole Gita, it will require six and
a half minutes per day to complete the reading in fourteen days and
l3 minutes per day to complete it in seven days. Those who are
interested in the reading will not grudge the extra 6_ minutes. To
those who are not interested, even the 6_ minutes being given to the
reading at present are a burden. This is Kakasaheb’s argument in
support of his suggestion. Both the suggestion and the argument
appeal to me. Think about them independently and, if they appeal to
you, put them before the other members of the group and discussVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 249them. Discuss them with Mahadev if he is there. Those who join in the
reading voluntarily and with true understanding of its meaning should
be consulted first. If their view is against the suggestion, the matter
need not be pursued further. It should be put before the rest of the
group only if they welcome it. I have even prepared a time-table for
completing the reading in seven days. I do not give it here just now. I
will send it if the suggestion is favourably received. But no, there will
be no need to write about it, for Kakasaheb will be there in two weeks’
time and he will personally explain the scheme. I will add this,
however. I think it would be right to permit those who are not even
today interested in the reading to leave the prayer-meeting when the
reading begins. The reading always comes last, so that everyone will
be present during the main part of the prayer, guests and visitors
excepted of course. In Wardha, and most probably in the Pratishthan
too, they do the reading of the Gita in the same manner as we do at
Sabarmati. We should, therefore, find out whether the suggestion suits
them too, and so I wrote last week to Vinoba and Hemprabhadevi. As
we understand better the importance of the devotional reading of the
Gita and come to look upon the work as the lighthouse which guides
our actions in life, we shall be less inclined to grudge the practice of
completing the reading in one week. Much will depend, of course, on
the person who leads the reading. If he puts his whole heart in it, he
cannot but make it interesting. If we meditate during the whole day on
the chapter which was read at the prayer-meeting, we shall
discovernew meanings in it and understand better those which we
know.
A mahavakya  lends itself to ever new interpretations, and the
Gita is a mahavakya .

CHI. KASHI,
I see from Chhaganlal’s letter that you suffer from constipation.
I think that if it does not respond to change of diet, enema is the best
remedy. That is the experience of the present-day doctors. I may say
that it is only with the help of enema that I am able to keep well. The
enema water should be lukewarm and should be inserted slowly.
Soda-bi-carb and salt should be added to the water. At least two
pounds of water should be inserted into the intestines and retained for
about five minutes, if possible. Take sun baths. The abdomen should
be massaged daily. Do this patiently. The enema should be taken in
the morning on an empty stomach.

DEAR FRIEND,
Your touching letter of 28th ultimo has been given to me. My
sympathy goes out to you in your affliction and I should be glad
indeed if this letter brings you any comfort.
In my opinion you are in no way to blame. Having got the lady
doctor you were quite right in trusting her. I do not believe in
constant change of doctors and hakims. We must trust those whom we
get to tell us when they need assistance or are in doubt as to their
diagnosis. Sometimes it may be found that the trust was misplaced.
But these are risks and chances of life which we must take always. I
hope therefore that you will not worry yourself over what you
consider was your negligence. This much you know yourself that you
did not wilfully neglect anything. More no man can do.
1 This was in reply to a letter dated October 28, 1930 from Pyare Lal Govil,
Sub-Judge, Muzaffarnagar, U.P. He had lost his parents some 15 to 20 years ago and
his only sister 16 years before writing. Narrating the circumstances of the death of
his only child, a 24-year old daughter, following a delivery, he wrote that the sepsis
from which she was suffering could not be diagnosed in time. He blamed himself for
“culpable mistakes” resulting in her death. He further wrote: “If God has made
destinies and every thing happens as has been fixed beforehand then there is no use in
praying for mercy. If He is powerless then He need not be approached.
The following shankas [doubts] arise:
1. What prayashchitta  should I perform to wash off this sin of utter care-
lessness?
2. How to give rest to her soul?
3. Could she have not been saved if correct and timely help had been given?
4. Is God powerless in changing the course of destinies? If so then there is no
use in prayer, nor in taking medicines nor in asking for medical help, or in making
any efforts that way.
5. Does a soul wander here and there for any length of time after departing from
this body?
6. How should and can I know that she has taken birth anywhere else?
7. The idea that I have been very careless haunts me every moment, although I
can swear that I did not know that I was making any mistake when I made them, else I
would have never made them. I do not know what had become of my discretion and
sense. Now I want nothing but I wish to know if I can in any way help her soul to get
rest and stay in Heaven. If so what should I do?
Very kindly give your ashirvad for the departed soul.”VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 253Now for the answers to your questions:
(1) No prayashchitta  is needed because in my opinion there was
no carelessness on your part.
(2) No one can give rest to another soul. Her rest will come
from herself.
(3) It is impossible to say what would have happened if other
assistance had been procured. In spite of the ablest expert help kings
have to die.
(4) There ought not to be much sorrow or fuss over an
inevitable event. Death is the lot of every created thing, nor need it be
considered as a calamity. Death is in reality a deliverance.
(5) What the soul does after discarding a body is in each case
surmise but it is a certainty that the soul does not perish with the body.
Let us trust the laws of God or nature for the rest.
(6) States before birth and after death are invisible as the Gita
affirms and experience confirms. But we can infer from our present
state that the condition after death is at least likely to be a second,
though modified, edition of the present.
(7) We the survivors can certainly help the departed dear ones
by wearing into our own lives all that was good in them. For if they
know anything of what happens here they must be consoled by the
knowledge that we are treasuring their memories by adopting what
was best in them.
Yours sincerely,
M. K. G ANDHI
[PS.]
One question has been omitted by oversight. God is never
powerless. But His laws are immutable. We do not know them. Nor do
we know His will at a given moment. Therefore we adopt within
bounds such remedies as may commend themselves to us. Prayer is to
the God within. It does not provoke God to change His will but it
enables us to know His will which is everything.

YERAVDA JAIL,
November 21, 1930
CHI. JAYAPRAKASH,
Today I have sent you a telegram about Prabhavati which you
will have received. I await your reply.1 I hope you have sent her to the
Ashram. The best thing of course would be for you to go with her and
have her fixed up there. Any programme about her future work can
be decided after she gets well. I understand your sorrow. I have
thought over it. You should not say anything to Prabhavati. If she is
moved by desire there will be no problem. But if she has no stirrings
of desire, it becomes your duty to protect her. I need hardly remind
you that women have as much right to freedom as men. It is my firm
opinion that if one partner in marriage has sexual urge it is by no
means the duty of the other partner also to have such urge, though it
is the right of the partner with the sexual urge to satisfy that urge. This
is perhaps one of the causes of polygamy. Just as it will be considered
immoral for a man to cohabit with a wife who is ill it should also be
considered immoral to cohabit with a wife who has no sexual desire. It
is therefore my earnest advice that if Prabhavati has no craving for sex
you should give her freedom and find yourself another wife. I see no
immorality in that. After all what is to be done? How can your craving
be forcibly stifled? You consider sex necessary and beneficial for the
spirit. In such a situation I would not consider a second marriage
immoral from any point of view. In fact I feel that your doing so may
well set an example to others. Many young men use force with their
wives. Others visit prostitutes. Still others indulge in even worse
practices. Prabhavati has chosen to live the life of a virgin. You do not
wish to practise brahmacharya . Therefore I see nothing wrong in
your respecting the wishes of Prabhavati and finding yourself another
wife. If you cannot think of another woman, you should, for the sake
of Prabhavati, observe brahmacharya . If your love for prabhavati
isreally true you will find that as soon as you go near her your sexual
craving will subside. I have placed my views before you. Do as your
duty bids you. May God grant you the strength to do so.

leading a luxurious life and getting paid for it, I would myself say that
you were not living correctly. You must therefore get rid of this
sensitiveness. I am glad you had all those precious hours with
Jairamdas. The way to cultivate faith in God is to recognize our
nothingness and thus be humble as a particle of dust. You know the
prayer to Mother Earth in our morning verses. The best of us at his
very best is a tiny thing and utterly helpless. And yet we are not so
helpless the moment we know that we are sparks `from the Divine
which is in us. Faith does not come from reason. Faith is believing.
Believe in God because those whose names we hold sacred have
believed and testified.
You will keep up a respectful correspondence with Father even
though you may scent coldness on his part at times.
Yours

CHI. KUSUM (SENIOR),
I have your letter. If you will only realize that the verses1 are a
part of our prayers and that, therefore, we should learn them by heart,
you will be able with some effort to get absorbed in them. You should
not lose heart if you do not succeed in the effort. All those who recite
them do not become absorbed in them. If, however, you continue to
have faith and recite them, one day you will find that you can become
absorbed in them. Moreover, the verses have a deep meaning. If you
meditate over it, that, too, will help you to concentrate on them.

CHI. SHIVABHAI,
I have your letter. I think my memory is as weak as yours, but
this is the method I followed, and still follow, for memorizing
whatever I did, or do when I get any time for that, and I have no doubt
that it is the best one. We should first try and understand the meaning
of what we wish to memorize and the relations of the different parts to
each other. After we have done this, all that remains to do is to commit
to memory the poet’s words expressing that meaning and those
relations. This is easy to do. Try this method and memorize Chapter
XII. Arjuna asks: “As between one who worships in this manner and
another who worships the Unmanifest, who is superior?” Reflect over
the reply to this question and then try to memorize the verses. This is
interesting, involves no waste of energy and, because we have faith, the
meaning sinks in our heart while we try to memorize the verses.

If Mother lives near the Ashram, you will feel easy in mind and

It is not obligatory on anyone to marry a particular person
and nobody else. If, however, a Hindu woman wishes to marry a
Muslim for good and sufficient reasons, we should not believe that she
would be committing a sin if she did so. How, then, can we object to a
woman marrying a so-called untouchable? Such a person is not a

the varna system. We should remember that marriage is a
universallyaccepted religious institution intended to put a restraint on
gratification of lust, and limit the field of choice for individuals. I
think I have fully answered your question.

There are two reasons why you do not like to spin. One, you do

poverty of the hunger-stricken. Two, you are not good at spinning.
Therefore, know the poor and if you understand our duty to have
compassion for the poor you will be interested without any effort.

well as you can because you will be spinning for them.

CHI. MIRA,
It was bad to have got fever again. But I suppose it is no use
fretting over it. There is undoubtedly poison in your system. It upsets
it on the slightest pretext. Whenever possible trace the cause and avoid
it in future. If it is rest that is needed and if you cannot take it at the
Ashram take it where you think you can get it. You may even go to
Vijapur where Chhaganlal is or some such quiet place. Even a week’s
change may set you up.
You will be pleased to hear that I have set the Bihar wheel going.
I followed your instructions and it went. The holders required
attention. I opened out the holes. I am not working at it because I am260 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImaking experiments with the Gandiv which still gives promise of
possibilities. I am describing the changes in my letter to Keshu.
Iwould speak to you about the Bihar wheel. The alteration you have
made doesn’t seem to me to have added to the utility of the wheel.
The original length of the platform is the ideal length. The length in
the “improved” machine is too much for drawing the thread away
from you and too little for drawing it towards you. The original
holders may admit of a change. I am trying the coir holders in the
Gandiv and they have worked exceedingly well. In the coir holders
the spindle moves in the rough and smooth convex surface of the coir
twine. Hence it moves with the minimum of friction. In the Bihar
holders the spindle moves lazily on 1/8th inch flat surface. Hence
there is avoidable friction. The coir holders undoubtedly last long,
take no time to make and hold oil better. Coir twine is available
anywhere. It can be picked from waste. These hints are for you to
note and follow out where you have leisure. Another good piece of
news. For the last three days I have been trying one of the taklis you
left here. It is giving me more satisfaction than the one I have made
and on which I was working. The mouth of mine is wretchedly made.
Yours is much better. I read today the translation of my summary of
the first chapter of the Gita. I can trace your hand in it. The sense has
been fairly preserved.
Love.

November 24, 1930
CHI. HARILAL (DESAI),
I have your frank letter. I understand what you say regarding
the marriage. Has the man any children? Is his mother alive? Has
Hari-ichchha gone to her husband’s house? It was certainly wrong of
you to have given up the tannery work. I see in your action a
weakness common in our society. The reasons to which you yielded
while leaving the work were before you when you took it up. Only
yesterday, while I was translating Prayer No. 127, I read the following
verse in it;
Revolve the thing in your mind carefully before you act,
Never go to fight in a battle in blind rivalry of others,
If you go, fight till you are hewn to pieces.
If you break your vow once, you will not know where to end. 
You have also not properly understood your duty to your
mother. Suppose a mother belongs to a society in which drinking is
common. Her son gives it up as an evil, but the mother tries to
dissuade him from doing so, and threatens to commit suicide if the
son gives up drinking. In these circumstances, is it the duty of the son
to give up what he regards as his duty? To honour the word given by
Dasharatha, Rama left for the forest and let Dasharatha die. Though
Kaikeyi entreated Bharata with piteous tears, Bharata clung to his
decision not to accept the throne. Judging by common standards, had
Kaikeyi done anything wrong? She was one of the many queens, and
in any case she had her husband’s word. What sin had she committed
in demanding the throne for her son? But Bharata saw sin in her
action and disregarded her entreaties.
I have not written this to reproach you. I cannot feel angry with
you. I have written what I have done because I thought it my duty to
explain to you what your duty was.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
November 24, 1930
CHI. PREMA,
I have your letter giving me all details. I was glad. I don’t
always remember the reasons behind my decisions. You have proved
yourself a true soldier. It is a mistake if you believe that, by remaining
there, you are not doing a soldier’s duty. All persons are not sent to
the front. Many recruits are kept in reserve. Moreover, very
responsible persons are required at the head-quarters. One must of
course give up fear of danger and face it whenever it comes. But
anyone who needlessly rushes into danger is not a soldier but a fool. I
look upon Narandas as a true soldier. Who knows what dangers are in
store for you? True soldiership lies in abiding by God’s will. That is
non-attachment. If we express that idea in common language, it means
that we should act as ordered by the general to whose discipline we
have voluntarily submitted ourselves.
The Ashram children have complained in their letter against
Dharmakumar, that he is dirty. Dhiru seems to know about it. Inquire
about this.
I understand your view about the ceremonial recitation of the
Gita. On this issue you may quarrel with Kakasaheb to your heart’s
content. Personally, I think that at the back of your opposition to the
proposal is your aversion to or lack of faith in the prayers themselves.
If you had your way, I think you would have nothing besides the
dhun. I would advise you to have faith in all the items of the prayers.
If possible, concentrate your attention on the meaning of each item. If
you cannot do that, have faith that the words you hear are noble and
that even the fact of listening to them will do you good, and attend to
them respectfully. Please do not understand from this that I wish to
convert you to the proposal for completing the recitation in seven
days. I have written this to convince you that there is some meaning
inthe prayers behind which lies fifteen years’ tapascharya , with
unswerving faith, on the part of some of us.

enclosed extracts from a letter from Satis Chandra Das Gupta which was more in the
nature of a discourse upon Tarini’s death. (S.N. 16758-m)268 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI386. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
At night, November 21/25, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your letter on Thursday (20th) morning. You should not
forward any letters unopened. Open every letter before forwarding it.
You may not read the letter, if the correspondent so desires, but even
that on the understanding that the correspondent should write about
no subject which is forbidden. Confidential letters, therefore, should
be about personal matters only. Adhere to the method which you have
been following.
It is certainly a painful matter that undesirable freedom was
taken in several respects at the time of Hari-ichchha’s marriage,but
you did right in tolerating everything patiently and giving all possible
help.
Sometimes dharma lies in setting aside such rules. The attitude
which you adopted was inspired by the spirit of non-violence. A
principle has no exception. When, however, the rules and regulations
framed to embody a principle are felt to kill its spirit, they may be set
aside. The occasion of Hari-ichchha’s marriage was of this kind.
At the present time I have dedicated myself heart and soul to
spinning and other related processes, and I find myself constantly
thinking about the subject. Since we do spinning as a form of yajna,
we should be very exact and regular in doing it, display the utmost
perseverance and sincerity in our work and become very proficient in
it. Most of us have no knowledge of even some elementary things
about spinning. We should acquire it now. That is, everyone should be
able to ascertain the count, strength and evenness of his or her yarn
and keep a record of these. One should also keep a record of the time
spent every day. If we do these things habitually, they will take very
little time. Everyone should pay attention to increasing his or her
speed, but without wasting yarn. People should also learn to keep the
spinning-wheel in repair. That is, they should know how to make the
belt, jotar and spindle-holder. They should know about the different
models of spinning-wheels. But you should not be burdened with the
task of thinking about all these matters and getting people to carry out
my suggestions. I have nothing else to engage my attention, but youVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 269have to face new responsibilities and problems every day. These
suggestions, therefore, should not impose a burden on you. You may
carry out, and persuade others to carry out, only those suggestions
which people can easily take up and act upon. Other people, too,
should concern themselves with these things and think about them.
Everyone should do what his interest and capacity incline him or
permit him to do. You will find in the letter to Lakshmidas a
description of my experience in this regard too; please read it.
Saturday morning
You have given a pleasing description of the service you are
doing. Take care that you do not fall ill through all this labour. You
have the spirit of non-attachment in you in good measure. There is
little likelihood, therefore, of your falling ill. Krishna is bound to
protect those who dedicate their work of service to Him. Your losing
weight is a good sign indeed. You have had a good crop of fruit in
theAshram.Mathew has not described what freedom he takes. He has
merely stated that he takes freedom. If you know in what respect, let
me know. We keep him in the Ashram because he is a good man. I,
too, believe that he will come round some day.
When you have no time because of pressure of work, it will
suffice if you write only a few lines. You will find it easier if you write
down from time to time what you think you must tell me. Don’t you
see that that is what I do here, though I am not as busy as you are? I
don’t depart from my daily routine in order to write these letters. That
routine, of course, concerns the hours of meals, sleeping, answering
the call of nature and spinning. The hours which are not taken up by
these activities are practically all spent in writing letters, except on
Tuesday. I know that you can arrange properly all your work, but
even then I feel tempted to write this. It is also a test of
non-attachment to work, that a person who has cultivated it will not
feel that he is working under pressure even when he is busy with a
variety of tasks. There is an excellent thought in an English saying. It
is that a busy man can always spare time for others. The point is that
such a person, even though working hard, is always found as fresh as
if he had no work and no one is disappointed by him.
I was very happy that you could take in Dhiru and Vimu. It was
also good that those two children felt drawn to the Ashram of their
own accord. Let me know how Dhiru behaves now.270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIAmidas’s experiment is worth watching. From here, I see an
error in it. If he does no work and rests all the time, he can certainly
live on fruit, but his experiment will not have succeeded. That is right
food for the body which gives it the necessary strength for the
ordinary duties of service. To get such strength, he should be able to
digest almonds and such other tissue-building foods. My experience
so far tells me that a weak stomach cannot digest foods like almond,
whereas it can digest the same nutrients from milk. However, I don’t
wish to write about this to Amidas or suggest it indirectly to him. His
sincere faith will probably give him the required light. Let us hope
that he will correct his mistake, if he is making any, and that he will
learn from his experience the value of milk or discover some
vegetarian substances similar in value to foods of animal origin.
. . .’s1 case is a sad one. I did feel something unattractive on his
face, but I believed that he was a good man and used to dismissthe
other thought from my mind. And I was right in doing that. Even
when he fell at times, he continued to struggle and it is possible that he
has succeeded in his struggle by now. If so, the expression on his face
may also have changed. It was said about Socrates that till the last his
face did not seem like a good man’s. There is, therefore, only one
path for creatures like us who are always liable to error. We should
always assume a man to be good till we come to know something
against him.
Give me the names of Chandrakanta’s father and mother. I will
then write slips for them. What you have written to them is right. They
ought to give up worrying about her. It would be best if Kanta’s
mother does not come to the Ashram. She will probably be a burden
on Gangabehn. Punjabhai’s becoming unconscious occasionally is
God’s grace. That seems to give him some rest. It would be best if
Champa’s delivery takes place in the hospital to which Amina was
admitted. She will get all facilities there and will be well looked after,
and nobody else will be put to trouble. Some woman or other who can
be spared from the Ashram may visit her from time to time and stay
with her. If this is possible, suggest it to Champa. If she agrees, she will
find the arrangement convenient.
Monday morning, November 24, 1930
Most probably I wrote to you that I had received the bark-sheet
sent by Ratubhai. I used it till this day as a covering when sleeping,
1 The name has been omitted.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 271but it has not become soft. I do not know whether or not it can be
washed. As it remains stiff, I thought it would be more useful for
spreading on the floor and that is what I have started doing from
today. I am sitting on it just now.
Vinoba tells me in his letter that he has sent two taklis. I have
made inquiries. They do not seem to have been received here so far. I
wonder if they have been received there. If you have received them,
send them here.1
I call this chapter the key to an understanding of the Gita, and
the gist of it is that life is given us for service and not for enjoyment.
We have therefore to impart a sacrificial character to our lives.
Intellectual assent to this proposition is only the first step, but
such assent and conduct in terms of that assent are bound to rid our
heart of its impurities in course of time. But what is real service? In
order to obtain the right answer to this question, restraint of the
sensesis essential, as it gives us a clearer and clearer vision of the God
of truth. Service rendered with selfish motives ceases to be sacrifice.
Hence the urgent need for the spirit of detachment. When this is
understood, all manner of controversies lose their meaning for us.
‘Did Krishna really ask Arjuna to kill his relatives? Could such killing
ever be a part of one’s duty?’ Questions like these are set at rest for
ever. When detachment governs our actions, even the weapon raised in
order to strike an enemy down falls out of our hand. But a mere
pretence of detachment serves no useful purpose. If only we persevere
in our effort, detachment may come to us perhaps the very first day,
or maybe only after a thousand years. We must not worry over the
time this takes, for the effort carries within itself the seeds of success.
We must however be on our guard and make sure that it is a genuine
effort, and that there is no self-deception. And this is certainly
possible for us all.
I have thus been able to complete Chapter III in two parts. I
have now fifteen minutes left to me in which to finish this letter. The
title you have suggested for these discourses is rather long. It seems
you propose to publish them one by one. Kaka suggests a short title
Gitabodh2. I like it. The intention behind the present attempt is that it
may help those who read the discourses to understand the meaning of

in my aim. But that is the intention behind my attempt and, therefore,
the title Gitabodh  suits the discourses very well. I doubt the necessity
of an English translation of these discourses. But the final decision
can only be made there. As for the suggestion to complete the
devotional reading of the Gita in a week, Kakasaheb will now discuss
it personally. If no one likes the idea, we certainly don’t wish to act
upon it.

Dudhabhai is in jail. Ascertain in which jail. If he is in Sabarmati
Jail, someone should go and visit him. Where hasSomabhai taken up
work? I wrote to Jairamdas and told him that I was not eating fresh
fruits. My reason for doing so was that there was a statement by the
‘lathi’ Department1 of the Government that it was not true that I had
given up eating fresh fruits in protest against lathi charges and that I
still ate them. I have already told you what I eat. However, I give here
the history so far, so that, if an occasion arises, you may issue an
authoritative rejoinder. I had given up fresh fruit for the most part
during the salt-march. I had resumed it after I was brought here. But I
gave it up after I heard about lathi-charges. I must have accepted it for
three or four days when I heard about the lathi-charges. That was the
position when Jairamdas met me. After that, with a view to overcoming
constipation and saving expenditure, I gave up the dry fruits which I
had been eating, namely, dates, currants and raisins and started eating
vegetables only. For some days I ate both fruit and vegetables and
then went over exclusively to vegetables, but realized that I could not
keep fit on them alone. So I again went back to dates and raisins.
Among the vegetables, I used to be supplied unripe papaiya.
Sometimes the papaiya would be ripe and I would eat that too. This
did not happen while Jairamdas was here. I must have accepted about
ten times ripe papaiya supplied from the garden here. Lemon, I of
course take every day, and Jairamdas has mentioned the fact. His
statement, therefore, is quite correct and the Government’s on the
whole incorrect. It is only recently that I have been receiving papaiya
1 Probably the Home DepartmentVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 6 JANUARY, 1931 273and no one can say, because I eat it, that I live on fresh fruit. Probably
no official knows about this fact at all, for the papaiya is supplied to
me along with raw vegetables. It is never bought from the market.
This is the position. Kakasaheb will be released on the 29th and he
will of course state the correct position more clearly. My belief is that
the Government official [responsible for the statement] has made no
distinction between fresh and dry fruits or that he has assumed, from
my having accepted a basket of fruit which may have been brought
by a visitor and which I may have passed on to Kakasaheb, that I
myself had eaten the fruit. God alone knows how the statement came
to be issued. If no controversy follows, you need not go out of your
way to issue any statement.

I have a letter from you this time after many week. I hope
Chhaganlal will make good use of his enforced rest. Though late, the
cutting off of Vimala’s hair is to be welcomed. Everything has its own
appointed time. You need not feel sorry that you did not get her hair
cut off earlier. The idea was so completely new that it is not surprising
that a mother should not accept it readily. It is best that you should
accept anything I may suggest only if you are convinced about it; you
will then cling to it. It is my duty to have patience till I succeed in

391. LETTER TO JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN
November 27, 1930
CHI. JAYAPRAKASH,
When I think of Prabhavati I feel that the sooner she goes to the
Ashram the better it will be. That she will go to the Ashram if she does
not recover will mean that she will go when her illness has become
worse. You who have been educated in the West should understand
that illness should be tackled at its inception. I have known cases of
hysteria where recovery was effected by the transfer of the patient to a
different place. In Prabhavati’s case it is doubly necessary that she
should have a change of weather. She is ailing and she is also faced
with a moral crisis. In a freer atmosphere she will be better able to
know her heart and she will also discover her duty. The difficult
question before you is that of freedom of women. If Prabhavati has as
much freedom as you, you must concede to her the right to think for
herself.

I have your letter. Many children suffer when they cut teeth.
Hence it is nothing strange that she does too. But her cold should go.
Somebody should carry her and walk in the sunshine. The head
should be kept covered. This will warm up the skin and make it less
sensitive. I believe the cold will then disappear.
Once you have formed the habit of keeping accounts, you don’t
find it a burden to do so and discover through experience the very
great value of the practice. Whether or not one’s life is peaceful
should make no difference in this matter. There are some things

you go and stay there for some time. Then you will also have some
peace of mind to think about your problems and be able to judge

398. DUTY OF SATYAGRAHI PRISONERS1
[Before November 29, 1930 ]
Our civil disobedience is fulfilled when we seek imprisonment.
Disobedience would cease to be civil if we defied legitimate jail
discipline. We may not therefore shout or create a row in the jails. We
may not refuse work when it is demanded of us according to rules. We
should rather be anxious to do as much work as we can and that too as
efficiently as we are capable of. It would be nice if even ‘simple
prisoners’ volunteered to do some useful work not necessarily         
with a view to getting any remission. Prisoners undergoing simple
1 This was quoted by D. B. Kalelkar in an interview to The Bombay Chronicle .
On the basis of the discussions he had with Gandhiji before his release on November
29, 1930, he observed: “He does not think himself competent enough to guide the
political struggle today because he is removed from the field of action. To a
satyagrahi, imprisonment is a civil death. But as a prisoner he can give authoritative
instructions for prospective satyagrahi prisoners. Daring my stay with him in the
Yeravda jail I discussed with him various aspects of the jail life and elicited from him
some useful instructions. He had no objections to my sharing them with workers in
the cause of swaraj. I give them below as they occur to me.
A satyagrahi should realize that his antagonism or disobedience ceases as
soon as he is convicted by the court. He is not out to paralyse jail discipline. In war, a
prisoner lays down his arms and capitulates when he is caught. The enemy can always
rely on the words of a true ‘soldier-prisoner’. A prisoner of war would not try to
escape, would not try to deceive when he is allowed an amount of liberty on the
strength of his word of honour. We, as satyagrahis, should try to be ideal prisoners in
jails. We must always be prepared to abide by the rules of jail discipline so long as
they do not go against the ordinary canons of humanity and self-respect. I have
sometimes heard some young satyagrahis arguing against submitting to jail
discipline. They say: ‘We came to jail because we wanted to disobey the laws of
Government. How do you ask us to obey the rules inside the jail? We are pledged only
to non-violence but we will certainly defy the Government even in jails.’ “280 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIimprisonment have helped a great deal in easing tense situations by
merely offering to do hard labour. Whatever work we turn out is so
much addition to the National Wealth.

399. LETTER TO CHANDRAKANTA
[Before November 11, 1930 ]1
CHI. KANTA,
I have your letter. You can go as Premabehn did, after obtaining
permission, If there is a reason you also may go with permission as
Premabehn has done, so arranging the time that the work does not
suffer when you have a reason or feel an irresistible wish to go. You
may tell Narandas. You will not be able forcibly to restrain your
mind. Restraint should be exercised with understanding.
Brother should improve his health. The cure rests in his own
hands. If one pays attention to the right amount of exercise, regularity
in all work, hip-baths and moderation in eating, the health does
improve in a large measure. There can be no question of giving the
sewing-machine to a person who does not know how to use it. Of
course if there is somebody to teach, it may be lent. You cannot be
expected to teach sewing since all your time belongs to the Ashram.
Gangabehn or Narandas may arrange for a teacher. Have I answered
all your questions ?

YERAVDA MANDIR,
Night, November 30, 1930
CHI. PREMA,
I was very happy to read your letter. It is two days now since
you broke your fast. By the time you get this letter, you will have
forgotten all about the fast and will be enjoying new youth. If you do
not have that experience, I would not regard the fast as a complete
success. I expect that you will describe the result of your fast in detail.
Your experience should be a guide to others. You know, of course,
how to return to normal diet gradually after the fast is over. You will
feel very hungry immediately after a fast, but you should certainly not
eat as much as the stomach demands. You should gradually increase
the quantity of milk and curds, and eat nothing between the meals.
You may of course eat juicy fruits. I hope you do not count expense
in that regard. Your body should become completely healthy. I am
not surprised to hear that you could work normally during the fast. I
have observed many people doing so. And that is my own experience,
too. Those who have been harbouring many diseases in their bodies
feel stronger during a fast. At any rate there is a brighter light on their
faces.
I am satisfied with the children’s account sent by you.
Krishnavijay seems to stand first in every item. Is there no one who
can take Dudhibehn’s classes in her absence? I know that in the
present circumstances you cannot ask anyone about this. What can
you do when so many women are outside the Ashram? All the same, if
there is any person to whom you can entrust the work, do not hesitate
to ask him or her.
Dhurandhar must have been released. Tell him that I remember
the discussions I had with him. I also remember his diary. Ask him to
write to me. Let him describe his experience, too. He should also write
about his future plans.
Mathuri has a complaint against you, that you beat children.
Sometimes you even use a rod. If this is true, give up the practice.
One should never beat children. Crosby has written a book called
Tolstoy as Teacher. Probably it is in our collection. Read it. It has now
been proved that physical punishment does not reform children.282 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIknow that anyone who is accustomed to use the rod while teaching
will find it difficult to give up the practice. But that is also true of an
armed soldier. He thinks that without his gun he can get nothing done
in this world. Our Ashram exists to prove that we can do without a
gun. This is true in regard to children. I will not write more than this
just now. If necessary, I will go into further argument after I get your
reply.
I hope that you had plenty of sleep during the fast, and that now
you regularly go to bed early. One ought to have sufficient sleep.
Man needs sleep more than he does food. Fasting in regard to food
benefits one, but fasting in regard to sleep wastes away one’s body. It
dulls the brain and makes one restless. Do not, therefore, be careless
about sleep. I would not complain if you sleep soundly between 9
p.m. and 4 a.m.
You will read about my experiment in the letter to Mira.

Your letter to hand. You must resolutely get up at 4 a.m. It does
not matter if you do not have any motions. Cleanse your mouth and
say the prayers; drink a bowlful of cold water after cleansing the
mouth. Go out for a walk after the prayers. Walk briskly. This will
induce motions. You will feel warm instead of cold. Don’t worry if
your bowels do not move. After the walk, you can occupy yourself in
whatever task you choose. Go to the lavatory when you feel the urge.
You will be cured by doing so for some days.

November 29 /December 1, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
This is time after the morning prayer 29-11-1930. It is fairly
cold. But I do a little writing after the prayer and before walking out
on the bugle of 5.30.
I am glad you were better when you wrote your letter. We can
only learn really in everything as in the matter of health-keeping by
making repeated mistakes and profiting by them. This is an
introduction to my confession rather than a warning to you. Last
Thursday I suddenly developed a bad stomachache. I could have
avoided it but stupidly did not. As you know I have been lately living
on curds. They agreed very well though the bowels could be moved
only by the enema. But as you saw the weight was going up and I was
otherwise fit. So I continued the curds and then too the thick part.
That induced further constipation despite the enema. That was
sufficient warning to stop at least curds or better still all food for a
day. I would not and suffered for the day. I voluntarily brought out
what I had eaten and in a few hours the pain subsided. Nothing but
raisin water the next day and I was quite fit though at once I lost 3 lb.
in weight. It is ever thus with me. My weight beyond 95 is evidently
an uncertain quantity probably made up of poisonous matter. I
determined too to get rid of the constipation if it was at all possible, so
I have continued the stopping of curds. (Here is the bugle and I stop
for the time being). To resume at 8 p.m. And I am now taking cooked
leaves and tomatoes and dates or raisins. The bowels have moved
naturally, strength has been maintained and the weight has suffered no
further reduction. Yesterday I added sweet potatoes and today 12
almonds. No one need be alarmed at this change. If I feel weak or
lose weight steadily, I shall at once revert to milk and shall feel all the
better for the milk fast. If on the other hand the change agrees it will
be a source of additional joy. Therefore you should all rejoice over
the change. If it works, it is well. It is well also if it does not. I shall
take no risks.
So Kaka left and he wept as he left. We had come so close to
each other. Within two hours of his departure they sent mePyarelal
and of course he has taken possession of me. I put him on your
wheel. He spun 83 rounds. It went practically as I had set it up. We
have now concocted some improvements on the holder. He is at one
such whilst I am writing this. Somehow or other I can only think of284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthe wheel and all it connotes. The Gandiv too is undergoing
considerable improvement. I hope to try the improved wheel
tomorrow. I will have a movable wheel and will have a spring for
tension. If it works well, the output must increase. I am gradually
getting control over the takli. My speed on your takli went up to 87
rounds per hour. But Vinoba says I must first try the steel takli and he
has sent me two and I am trying to work at it. I haven’t yet got the
result expected. But I am daily gaining confidence and hope soon to
be able to pull 100 rounds per hour on the takli. (As it was 9 p.m. I
had to stop here. I resume at 4.30 a.m. after prayer Sunday.) I
understand about the Kumarappa differences. If Mahadev is gone
Kaka has now come. He may be of help in adjusting differences. The
golden rule is not to fret if things go contrary to one’s wishes and to
yield where resistance is useless or likely to be misunderstood, where
there is no principle at stake and where in an organization
responsibility is not solely one’s own. The virtue of charity comes
into play only when one comes in contact with a variety of opinion
and conduct. Strict and even harsh with ourselves, charitable and even
lax with regard to others. In the end, we find that we are neither strict
regarding ourselves nor lax regarding others. The fact is we do not as
readily observe our own blemishes as we are to detect those of others.
Hence the terrible truth “Pluck the beam out of thine own eyes before
you remove the mote from thy neighbour’s” or Burns’s (Is it not?)
“O that we could see ourselves as others see us.” In practice I have
found that it is best to search about ourselves and to assume the truth
of friends’ criticism of ourselves and to take them in the first instance
at their word when they disown guilt or defect. But enough of this
morning sermonizing. You will act as the spirit guides you.
Love.

Thursday morning
CHI. NARANDAS,
This time your packet was handed over to me as soon as it came
yesterday evening. I have received the copies of Vratavichar .
If Chi. Kusum is firm in her decision, I like it. Since in any case
she will not marry before swaraj is won, why should she bind herself
just now? The right thing would be to act upon her inclination at that
time. Convey this view of mine to both Devchandbhai and Jamnalalji.
Ascertain Kusum’s real wishes. She should not advance this as an
excuse if in the depth of her heart the real reason is different. She is
completely free to do what she wishes. I would tell this same thing to
the two young men too; if they are ready to wait till we get swaraj, why
should they wish to bind themselves or bind any girl now? A brave
man or bhakta would not do that, and if Kusum is a brave girl and if
she has decided to marry, she should marry a brave youth. I will write
to Ghanshyamdas.
Why does Manilal refuse to take milk? If he keeps up his
strength, however, I don’t insist that he should take it. Only, he should
not be obstinate in refusing to take it. If he is losing weight, he should
take it. Why doesn’t Devdas write?
Friday morning
Ever since I had heard about Amidas, I was filled with
admiration for him. He  has achieved perfect victory. He was like one
of the ancient sages in keeping his pledge. I believe the Ashram to
have been sanctified by his having stayed there. Let all of us learn
from Amidas how to die cheerfully for the sake of our pledge. If he
had been inspired by my example in taking  the vow of refraining
from milk, etc., he had acted hastily. I think that no one should copy
my example in this respect till I myself succeed in keeping such a
vow. It is, however, clear to me as daylight that, having taken the vow,
Amidas could not break it. A vow taken with open eyes, even if it
means a risk to the body, ought not to be broken. A vow which would
do harm to the soul ought not to be taken and, if sucha vow has been
taken, it is one’s moral duty to break it.  For instance, no one can takeVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 287a vow that he will always speak untruth, for such a   vow   harms the
soul. A  vow  always  to speak the truth may mean a risk to theto the
body and may cost us our life, it may even seem to harm the interests
of the country, but it must be kept. I will write a letter to his father.
Read it and send it on to him.

means to pay the premiums. He should manage somehow to pay them
and should send the receipt. Write to Jalbhai too about this. Make a
note of Budhabhai’s decision concerning Nanibehn and inform her
about it, and go on recovering the money till the amount is paid up. I
was not satisfied by . . . ’s1 letter. Read the reply which I have written
to him. So long as we entertain a suspicion about him, he cannot join
the struggle. Only those inmates of the Ashram who are pure in our
eyes may Join it.
Take the utmost care about the [spinning] yajna. Endeavour to
remove the deficiencies in such work. Everyone should learn to test
the strength and count of yarn, and should actually do so every day.
A rough and ready method of testing the strength can be easily
invented. It should be invented and everyone should test the strength
of his or her yarn with its help. If the yarn spun by each is woven
separately, we would know its strength better.
It was very good indeed that Sitala Sahay came. But how did he
escape the attention of the U.P. Government? Show Shivabhai’s letter
to Kakasaheb before you send it to me. If the facts he mentions are
such as can be given publicity, there is no objection to his writing to
me about them. On the contrary, there may be some advantage in
informing me about them. But leave the responsibility in this regard
to Kakasaheb.

to form such a connection. I will write to him. Read the letter and pass
it on to him.

The third, the fourth and the following fifth chapter should be
read together, as they explain to us what the yoga of selfless action
(anasakti) is and what are the means of practising it. If these three
chapters are properly understood, the reader will have less difficulty in
tackling what follows. The remaining chapters deal in detail with the
ways and means of achieving anasakti. We should study the Gita from
this point of view, and if we pursue this study we shall find without
much trouble a solution of the problems which confront us from day
to day. This calls for daily practice. Let everybody try it. If for
instance he is angry, let him remember the verse dealing with anger
and subdue that enemy. Supposing we heartily dislike somebody, or
are impatient or gluttonous or in doubt as to whether we should do or
should not do something or other, all these difficulties can be solved
with the help of mother Gita if we have faith in it and give it constant
study. Our daily recitation of the Gita as well as this series of letters is
a means to this end.

December 3, 1930
BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
I heard from Jamnalalji that a friend or a partner of yours had
lost heavily in speculation. The message also says that this has caused
you sorrow. Speculation itself implies loss. Then why take it to heart?
A direct lesson drawn from this loss can even be a source of
happiness. Why don’t you and your friends take a vow not to indulge
in speculation any more? Earnings from speculation can never be
truly ethical.

The Ashram post received last evening brings your disturbing
letter. It does not cause anxiety but it furnishes food for reflection.
What is the cause of this breakdown in health? In any case you must
give yourself complete rest. You must relax both mind and body.
Therefore please go gently. Read the 6th chapter [of the] Gita. Yoga
should be undertaken gently. What work we are doing is yoga. Please
drop me a card daily.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
December 4, 1930
CHI. KASHINATH,
I got both your letters. I was glad to learn that your mother and
others had arrived. If you take your meals with your mother with
Narandas’s consent, I should not object. However, there is certainly a
moral flaw in what you are doing. You ought to make it clear to
Mother that the life which you two live is different from normal
family life. Of course the financial aspect of the matter creates some
difficulty. But I have stated here only the ideal. Do not take my words
to mean that you ought to take your meals in the common kitchen, as
we cannot always live up to an ideal and sometimes in actual practice
we have to compromise it in order that we may not be forced to give it
up altogether. As for your relations with Father, strictness is necessary.
You should tell him in the plainest language that he should give up
hopes of your taking up a job or a profession and earning money. By
telling him this, you will serve him, for, as long as there is the slightest
hope, he will continue complaining to you, but will cease doing so or
rather the complaining will cease of itself, when he has given up the
hope. This is human nature. When hope is entirely gone, despair itself
turns into a sort of consolation. There are here several prisoners
serving life sentences, who have no hope of being released and,
therefore, live cheerfully. Those whose position is uncertain, like mine,
suffer. They keep on hoping from day to day that they would soon be
released. In other words, the cause of the pain in your relationship
with Father is in your own mind. If you have understood your dharma
clearly you should not so much as give a thought to Father’s
complaining. To borrow money from friends to help Father to pay his
debts and relieve his burden to that extent is not a good policy. It
would be better not to receive such private benefits from one’s
friends. Here again, I have merely stated the ideal. It may be advisable,
in case of necessity, to borrow money from Mahavir Prasad and others
if your relationswith them are intimate. Solve all these problems with
the master key of non-attachment.

I have your letter. It was a beautiful one. Dhiru’s firmness is
wonderful. His inclination towards mischief reflects this firmness of
his. Let us hope that some of these Ashram children will excel us all in
service when they grow up. If we are pure in our hearts and become
daily purer, that is bound to be so.
I am not surprised by your description of the conditions in

What you say is true. Let the Government seize all the goods

no property. If any is left with them, they should know that the
Government can seize it whenever it wishes to do so. Our struggle

Do you want compliments for your fast and the cheerful spirit
you kept up during the period? I have already written to you about
what to eat. Avoid uncooked vegetables for the present, and certainly
do not eat pulses. You should take milk and curds and eat khakhra
and boiled vegetables; if you can get fruits, like papaiya and
mosambi, you will not require vegetables. I, personally, see no need
for medicines. Apart from any other consideration, I am generally
averse to taking any medicine of which the ingredients are not known
to us. The fast must have completely served the purpose of medicine.
I think it is necessary to continue sun-bath. See that you have enough
sleep.

421. LETTER TO BHAGWANJI PANDYA
December 6, 1930
CHI. BHAGWANJI,
I have your letter. Your interpretation of the term abhyasa is
correct, as also of chittavrittinirodha. Dhyana=Upasana,  i.e., ulti-
mately it could mean faithfully observing one’s own dharma. In my
view here the word dhyana is used in a narrower sense. Dhyana refers
to our silent sittings at the time of our worship and prayers. This
brings about a [sense of] dedication to the Lord, which in its turn
gives rise to a disinterested attitude. No social service is possible
without self-purification, which again develops in the course of social
service. It is all right therefore that doubts arise in your mind but you
should not fall into their currents. If they are resolved so much the
better; if not you should have faith that they would be solved as you
go on serving.

YERAVDA MANDIR,

CHI. MAHALAKSHMI,
I have your letter. What you say is true. No one ought to give up
his or her work for any reason whatever. This is the ideal. We should
not feel unhappy if everybody cannot act up to it. We should not
criticize such a person even in our thoughts. We should be strict in
judging our own weaknesses, but generous in judging others. This is
not goodness but the correct principle to follow. We have no
knowledge of the struggle which the person whose weakness we
observe may be making. It is the effort which matters. It may be that
we are free from a particular weakness, but that may not be the result
of any effort on our part. There is no merit in our refraining fromVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 299flesh-eating, since we are accustomed from birth to do without it. But
there may be great merit in the self-denial of a person who was a
habitual meateater but has given up eating it now, though he may
repeatedly break his vow. Hence the right thing is that we ourselves
should do the best we can to follow a rule perfectly, and be satisfied
with what others can do. You have been getting good experience. I am
sure that you will come out successful from the test. The diet which
you follow is the right one.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
December 7, 1930
CHI. MATHURADAS,
Hitherto I had been an admiring reader of your articles. That
admiration remains, but now there is added to it the viewpoint of a
student and a critic. I see that your book is not a self-teacher on the
subject. By reading it one cannot learn carding. Even those who know
it a little would not be able to carry out the reforms you suggest. The
book is excellent in itself, but as a self-teacher it seems to me
incomplete. As far as I have understood your book I think you have
rejected the method you had explained to me and have followed a
new one. I thought I had already adopted it. But on reading your
book again, I find that I had done nothing new at all. Now my
suggestion is that you should send me a draft lesson as if you were
teaching me the method. It is not necessary to rewrite the whole of
your book. How much cotton should I hold out to the string at a time
and in how many pulls should it get carded? With how much cotton
should I begin the carding? Should the pad be arranged anew every
day and why should it be of half-carded cotton? And should that in its
turn be carded the same day? Should all the cotton put on the mat in
the beginning be carded the same day? As we pull at the string, the
bow also swings, doesn’t it? The left hand should be used only for
raising and lowering the carding-bow and it is moved forwards and
backwards by the action of the rod; isn’t that what you mean? If you300 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcannot find time to explain all this, don’t pay any attention to this
letter. Your main work is to examine those who are learning there and
improve their proficiency. I am like a by-stander who is looking on. I
know that I have no right to engage your attention on such matters
just now. This letter has two aims, one to point out the deficiencies in
the book and the other to seek help for myself. Treat the second as of
less importance. I have put briefly to Vithal the questions I have asked
above. Let him give me his time. He will learn something while doing
so.

DEAR DAUGHTER RAIHANA,
Now there are two teachers in place of one, a girl and a grey
beard. So the pupil is now done away with. Let us see what happens.
This exercise is enough, isn’t it.1 Anyway, am I not making progress?
Moreover, I have Pyarelal for companion now, and he is well-versed in
Urdu. However, I would not take up much of his time for this, as he
devotes all his time to spinning. You should, therefore, point out
mistakes in my spelling. You should not, in your present state of
health, spend much time for me. As I have plenty of leisure, I will read
your letters slowly and carefully. Mother is partial to Father. His
handwriting is an old man’s and yours that of a youngster. But let that
be. Though a person may own a white beard, he may be young in
mind and may play a thousand games—teach French to someone,
translate from other languages and revolve all manner of plans in his
mind. Others may be young in years, but old in mind. Of course I
would not say that you are quite that, but you will cease being so if
your septum trouble is cured. The news of that operation did not

oneself even while running to the place where fire has started in order
to help put it out.
Finally, the person whose life is dedicated to service and who has
burnt his or her egotism lives his life in the spirit of prayer. We pray
morning and evening in order that we may be able to live thus, and,

I have reserved your letter to the last deliberately in the hope of
hearing from you before or on Monday in reply to my postcard
which I wrote to you on Thursday and which I hope you duly
received. It contained an inquiry about your health. This obstinateVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 305constipation is disturbing. I hope when this reaches you all the effect
of the attack would have worn out. I have got rid of mine by simply
dropping proteid food for a while. I am now taking proteid through
almonds. I should love not to go back to milk. Save now for a visible
weakness, the result has been excellent. Almonds I am taking very
cautiously and I cannot sustain the strength on green vegetables
merely and about an ounce of almonds. I have gone to the ounce
only for the last two days. I must take a cereal. I have not decided
what to take. I want to try bajri or juwari—whatever the jail chapati
for the day. If it agrees, the problem may be solved to my entire
satisfaction. But there will be no haste, certainly no obstinacy.
Immediately I feel the need, I shall go back to milk.
In another ten days I shall have finished the translation of the
Bhajanavali . It has given me such a joy. I am not satisfied with the
performance. Save for the fact that it is an act of love, it has no
othermerit—certainly no literary merit. But it will help you to know
the meaning of the bhajans and that was all I aimed at. And when this
is finished I hope to begin the other, viz., translation of preface to the
Gujarati Gita. I do not think I shall translate the verses, but I shall go
through one of the existing translations and where it is different from
mine, I shall note it and translate all the marginal notes. This will
simplify my work and save a great deal of labour. Please share this
with Kaka. He will feel interested in the proposal.
The improvements in the Gandiv have exceeded all
expectations. It now runs smoothly. It has the tension which was
absent. But I am not going to weary you with a description of the
improvements. I am describing them in a letter to Keshu. I am
sure that for speed it cannot now be excelled by any other wheel. But
that has still to be tested. My assurance won’t create more yarn, I
know.
You must give yourself ample rest and must not work under
tension. It is good for the wheel but not for human beings.
Love.

From the original: C.W. 5424. Courtesy: Mirabehn; also G.N. 9658306 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI434. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
Thursday morning, December 4/9, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your letter yesterday evening. They pass on the packets to
me and post them to you with great care. It seems that the packets are
delayed in posting by a day.
The doctor wishes to come during Diwali. Does that mean after
nine months? Or does he mean the Christian Diwali? If he means the
Hindu Diwali, a great many things will have happened by then.
Mahalakshmi and Madhavji are very conscious of the deep
significance of a pledge. Hence both of them should be pained by a
violation of even the letter of a pledge. But we should be satisfied if
everyone keeps a pledge as he or she understands it and to the best of
his or her ability, and it seems that most people do so. You should
keep them vigilant.
Do what you think best about Giriraj. Since you will have to
bear the burden, I will accept your decision as the only proper one. I
know that Krishna will always have his own way. If he keeps good
health, I think he is likely to do great service in future.
I believe the same about Purushottam. Let him write to me from
time to time.
Pyarelal is improving quite well in health. I hope it will not go
down while he is with me. His being with me is like a goat being near
a wolf. A goat tied in front of a wolf will grow thinner every day even
if you feed it on the finest grass. Something of that sort used to
happen to Pyarelal. I hope that is not so now. I blame myself a good
deal for what used to be. Let us see what God wills. He will get what he
wants by way of food. At present, he takes milk and curds and eats
bread, vegetables and papaiya.
I had not imagined that Parnerkar would mismanage things as
badly as he has done. He is a worker with pure motives, but it seems
that he cannot cope with work. You did very well in being strict with
him and getting the accounts in order. I hope he will take rest now
and improve his health. Should we assume that the business at Bidaj is
running at a loss? If you think it necessary to reduce the scale or wind
up any of our activities, do so. Anyone who works in the spirit ofVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 307non-attachment soon discovers the measure of his ability. He will
never be too eager to do things and never undertake anything beyond
his capacity. Really speaking, he does not have to seek work. Work
comes to him unsought, and he does his best to do full justice to it. To
the world he seems a man who has no work, for his face betrays no
anxiety and he never complains about the burden of work. In fact he
carries no burden. He entrusts his burdens to Lord Krishna and
dances as He wills.
Jethalal had written to me saying that he would send a report of
the work done. I have not received the report. I understand what you
say about Kamalabehn Lundi. That is what marriage is. The desire for
it has its source in lust and attachment. Marriage is called a sacrament
because it is a means of controlling lust. That is how it was conceived,
at any rate. But this intention is now forgotten, and so for most people
marriage has become a means of self-indulgence. I will write to
Gangabehn and Nanibehn.
I have been watching your experiment in diet. Give me detailed
information from time to time. It will certainly benefit you if you eat
only a small quantity of groundnuts. You may not even need them
when you have milk and curds. There is certainly some truth in the
advice which research-workers now give against eating many articles
at a time. All the foods are not simultaneously digested in the same
manner and to the same degree and, therefore, a mixture of too many
of them disturbs the stomach. The description of compassion was very
good indeed. You say that you have sent the printed copies of the
discourses; that may also mean that they are being dispatched now. I
have not received them.
Friday morning
I have given all details about my health and my diet in the letter
to Kakasaheb, and so I do not repeat them here. I had assumed that
you would send for Keshu and hear his complaint, and that was why I
did not write about it in my letter. But I give a summary now as far as
I remember what it was.
1.  You get angry with him without any reason.
2.  Once he tried to explain matters to you, but you did not
listen to him and shouted at him so loudly that all could
hear you and you said many improper things.
3. You are very partial to Kusum, Navin and Dhiru and do
not even listen to any complaints against them.308 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI4. You have taken away from him the management of the
factory without any reason.
5. Damodardas left the Ashram out of disgust at your
partiality.
I have written to Keshu and told him that just as I used to be
under Maganlal’s spell and saw no faults in him, so am I under yours
and see no fault in you, and will not, therefore, be ready to believe
anything about you which I have not myself observed. I, however,
advised him to open his heart to you and tell you everything. He
merely said in reply that he was not satisfied by my letter. After that I
have kept quiet since he was to have a talk with Mahadev. Now you
should, yourself, call him and show to him his complaints which I
have described. If I have misunderstood him, he will correct my
mistake. If I have left out anything, he should add that. You may then
try to satisfy him if you can. I have written to him and advised him to
take up some work, no matter what it is. I have told Kakasaheb about
him. I have advised him, too, that he should see Kakasaheb. I have no
doubt that it will do him no good whatever to remain without work.
If Harilal Desai wants to take up service in the Ashram and if
you think there will be no harm in giving him a job do give him one.
He is unmethodical in work but he is a young man of transparent
sincerity of purpose. I think it will be worth while having him as one
of our workers. Did you read the long letter which . . .1 wrote to me?
He will produce no effect on me unless he tells me something
concrete observed by himself. I believe . . .2 to be a pure-hearted girl.
. . .3 has also produced on me the impression of being pure in heart
and one who would speak the truth. I had a happy experience of him
also during the march. He had spread the fragrance of his character in
the Kashi Vidyapith too. It is true that he has been guiding . . .4 and
trying to raise her level, but I have seen in him nothing but the attitude
of a brother and teacher.
Silence Day afternoon

the letter to Kakasaheb too. Hence I say nothing here.
These days I seem to be able to observe small things with greater
attention, and so I cannot help noticing the character of the
handwriting in the different letters received in the packets sent by you.
I am trying to improve my bad handwriting. You must have observed
this in every letter of mine. Bad handwriting is of course a form of
discourtesy. Discourtesy in every form is violence, but bad
handwriting is direct violence too. Anything which causes unnecessary
pain to our neighbour or to any living creature is nothing but
violence. I have twice as much experience as others of what pain and
inconvenience are caused to the reader by bad handwriting. I have, in
the first place, the experience of having to read letters written in bad
writing by others and also the experience of the pain caused to others
by my handwriting. My aim in saying this is to advise all inmates of
the Ashram, men and women, boys and girls, to take great care to
write a good hand. This requires no time but only some thought. One
must have love for the other party. Let all of them observe the
following rules:
1. They should leave enough space between the words.
2. They should avoid flourishes in the letters.
3. They should never leave a letter half-written.
4. They should not let the letters flow into one another.
5. As far as possible, they should write to no one in pencil.
If they follow these rules, they will certainly be able to make
their handwriting legible. Haste signifies attachment. Let no one write
in haste. Everyone should be content with what he or she can write
slowly and patiently.

CHI. KUSUM (SENIOR) ,
I got your letter. I observe no harmful effect on my health. I see
that the changes have done me nothing but good. Do not worry on
my account at all.
Pyarelal’s time is taken up as under: 375 rounds on the
spinning-wheel, 100 rounds on the takli and making the required
number of slivers. This work leaves him very little free time. The takli
takes up two hours of his time. I, too, do almost the same work. I spin
100 rounds on the takli, but am satisfied with 275 on the wheel. The
total comes to 375.
What you say about the girls is correct. Write to me more
plainly.

December 11, 1930
CHI. JAYAPRAKASH,
I have your beautiful letter. What you have thought about Father
is only right. I shall say nothing more about it. I hope you were
successful with Ghanshyamdas.
As regards the motherland being considered as your mother
there is a flaw in your thought. Just as loving one’s mother does not
mean that one should not love another’s mother, so also loving one’s
motherland does not mean hating other countries. Where there is no
love for the motherland love of the world is an illusion. And since the
motherland has a greater right over us, being proud of the motherland
without any ill will for other countries is only proper. I cannot directly
care for the children of the whole world. But if I care lovingly for the
children who are in my keeping I shall to that extent be doing service
to the children of the world. The case of the motherland is exactly
similar. After all it does matter in which land and in which atmosphere
we are born. Ahimsa has its origin in this thought. In so far as ahimsa
means universal love it can have direct application in our serving the
creatures who are nearest us.
I hope you will now take Prabhavati to the Ashram.

440. LETTER TO PRABHUDAS GANDHI
December 12, 1930
CHI. PRABHUDAS,
If one does not like a particular name, he should himself suggest
a better one. If Dhiru suggests a better one, we will keep it. As far as I
am concerned, I like the name ‘Magan’ for your spinning-wheel. The
three reasons given by you are even more appropriate.
Do not at all think about how long you will have to stay in
Almora. You know of my desire of setting up an ashram there. Just
take it that you are running an ashram on a rented place. A personVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 313who runs an ashram is not different from others. Any place where the
rules of an ashram are followed, is like an ashram. You are a society
of eight persons. You have with you there the Gita,  the Ramayana
and the spinning-wheel. What more do you want? For running the
ashram, it is necessary to have some persons. Just take it that you three
are the ones sent there for the purpose.
Devotion of Tulsidas was the devotion of the future generation.
Rama in a human form did not exist in Tulsidas’s time. His utterances
are imaginary . . .1 even if Rama in a human form did exist in his time,
his origin as God in human form took place in a later period.
Compare the seventh chapter of the Gita, to the grief of Rama. “I am
the Creator of all the three qualities.” Wherever we find deceit and
fault in God, we need not accept Tulsidas’s saying that God has no
faults and that we should not do as He does. We have to observe the
rules of proper conduct. We cannot abide by the text of the inimitable
book of Tulsidas, but have to abide by its inner meaning. What does
not appeal to us should be set aside. One experiences the mind’s
quality of forgetfulness every minute. Think over it.

CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
Your letter. I gave up fresh fruit on learning of the sufferings
outside. Now Pyarelal is with me. Eating, drinking, [spinning] yajna
are all karma or actions. An action that does not deserve to be
undertaken is vikarma or perverse action. Akarma is absence of action,
i.e., action undertaken by man without attachment or desire for the
fruit. A perverse action cannot be undertaken without attachment. Do
write if you have any doubts. Your health must be good when you
come out [of jail].
We both are well.

From a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 2385314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI442. LETTER TO MIRABEHN
December 13, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
Your p.c. was duly received. The absence of any further news
from you, I take to mean perfect restoration. After each illness you
are soon well, because the treatment followed is natural, but every
sickness leaves behind it a legacy of weakness unless the system is
allowed full rest and the mind relieved of tension. I suppose the
mental control is the most difficult. For this the sovereign remedy is
the application of the Gita. Each time mind suffers a shock, there is
failure in application. Let good news as well as bad pass over you like
water over a duck’s back. When we hear any, our duty is merely to
find out whether any action is necessary and if it is, to do it as an
instrument in the hands of Nature without being affected by or
attached to the result. This detachment appears a scientific necessity
when we remember that in bringing about a result more than one
instrument is employed. Who shall dare say ‘I have done it’[?] I know
you know all this. Nevertheless, I drive the truth home, so that from
the brain it may percolate to the heart. So long as it remains in the
brain only, it is a dead weight on it. Any truth received by the brain
must immediately be sent down to the heart. When it is not, it suffers
abortion and then it lies on the brain as so much poisonous matter.
What poisons the brain poisons the whole system. Hence the necessity
of using the brain as it should be merely as a transmitting station.
Whatever is there received is either transmitted to the heart for
immediate action or it is rejected there and then as being unfit for
transmission. Failure of the brain to perform this function properly is
the cause of almost all the ills that flesh is heir to as also for mental
exhaustion. If the brain simply performed its function, there need
never be any brain-fag. So whenever we suffer from illness generally
there is not only a dietetic error but there is also failure on the part of
the brain to function properly. The author of the Gita evidently saw
this and gave the world the sovereign remedy in the clearest possible
language. Whenever therefore anything preys upon your mind, you
should meditate on the central teaching of the Gita and throw off the
burden. Let us hope there never will be a recurrence of the terrible
constipation.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 315As to Kumarappa if you have enough charity and goodwill
forward to him all the criticism you receive leaving the result to take
care of itself. It is a duty you owe to him to let him have the criticisms.
You may now use Kaka too for the purpose of sending your
messages.
For me the milkless experiment continues as yet without any
bad result. The weight has suffered a further decrease of 3 Ib. but the
vitality remains. One cause of the decrease in weight is that I am most
cautious about increasing the quantity of cereals and almonds I take.
Almonds remain at 3 tolas and bajri and juwari bhakhari  a quarter,
i.e., about 2 tolas each time, i.e., at 11 and 5. I may soon increase the
weight. Anyway the condition of the bowels is extraordinarily good. I
quite agree with you that the enema as a habit is a bad thing and
should be got rid of, if at all possible. It has been possible with the
dropping of milk as it had become when, on going to Wardha, you
will recall, I had dropped milk. Indeed but for my folly in hastily
following Gopalrao I might still have been flourishing on the diet I
had then adopted. The present diet is a slight modification of the
Wardha one.
Whenever you are ill, you will not hesitate to write to me at once
without waiting for the weekly letter day.
Love.

December 14, 1930
CHI. PREMA,
I have your letter. I understand what you say about punishing
children. Your argument is an old one. It is a vicious circle.
Punishment did you good and so you think you should punish the
children. When the children grow up, they will do the same. This is
exactly the argument by which people justify their faith in violence. It
is our aim to rise above this misleading experience. I admit that that
requires patience. We have come together in the Ashram to cultivate
that patience. Our aim is not just to impart education to children or
teach them discipline, but to build character in them. Education,
discipline, etc., are means to that end. If the result of building
character in them is that education and discipline .are neglected, let
that be so. I understand your argument, though. I also see that there is
no ill will behind your use of the rod. But there are certainly anger
and impatience behind them. May I make a suggestion? Call a
meeting of the children. If any of them say, ‘You may punish us, and
in this manner, if we play mischief or disobey you’, you may punish
them in the manner which they suggest. You should not punish those
who do not want youto punish them. If you try this method, you will
see that you do not need to punish them. You should keep up this
discussion. Do not give up arguing out of impatience or despair. Till
your reason is convinced of what I say, you should follow your own
path. I know that you are dedicated to truth and, therefore, I am sure
that you will realize the truth ultimately.
Your diet seems to be all right.

CHI. KASHINATH,
I got your letter. I have already replied to Kalavati. The
treatment being given to Mother seems to be all right. There is no
doubt that constipation is the root cause of many diseases. I will
describe for your information the experiment I am making at present,
which has succeeded in curing my constipation at least. For two or
three days I took boiled leafy vegetables, together with which I had
also boiled unripe tomatoes. That by itself cured the constipation.
Then I started adding crushed almonds, gradually increasing the
quantity to three tolas and now I have been taking a few bhakharis
made of jowar and bajra flour. This seems to keep up my strength.
Of course I can say nothing definitely. I can do that if I can go on
like this for two or three months. Anyone who wishes to follow my
example should do so with great care. Both Santok and Radha know
about the two types of bath described in Kuhne’s book. They should
prove very beneficial for Kalavati. We do not have a copy of the
book1 on mouth hygiene.
Convey my compliments to Dr. Sarjuprasadji. I wish him
success in his work.
How do I deserve any blessing for the low prices of grain?
Wouldn’t the cultivators, for their part, curse me? There are several

Sunday [On or after December 14, 1930 ]1
CHI. RAMACHANDRA,
The letter bears no signature, but it is certainly from you. Your
effort in improving your writing is good. Keep it up. Tell Jiji that, in
regard to observance of dharma the question of Father’s pleasure or
displeasure does not arise. Ultimately everyone is reconciled if we
observe dharma. We have the example of Mirabai before us. Jiji
should not practise untouchability if she regards it a sin, as she ought
to.

457. LETTER TO PRABHAVATI
December 15, 1930
CHI. PRABHAVATI,
From Jayaprakash’s letter, it seems you must be in the
Ashram now. It has been arranged now that letters from you should
be handed over to me as soon as they are received. But I got no
postcard or letter either today or yesterday. If you have still not gone
over to the Ashram, do so immediately. Even after you have gone
there, you should write to me daily for some time. Your fainting fits
must stop, and I think they will in the Ashram. If you require fruit,
etc., don’t hesitate to ask for it. And don’t plunge into work
immediately. You have done enough work in the Ashram in the past,
and hence you should take complete rest now. Don’t burden your
mind with worries. Everything will happen as God wills it. Meditate
over the hymn Premal Jyoti2.
Blessings from
BAPU

Early in the morning I call to mind that Being which is felt in
the heart, which is sat (the eternal), chit (knowledge) and sukham
(bliss), which is the state reached by perfect men and which is the
super-state. I am that immaculate Brahma which ever notes the states
of dream, wakefulness and deep sleep, not this body, the compound
made of the elements—earth, water, space, light and air.

In the early morning I worship Him who is beyond the reach of
thought and speech and yet by whose grace all speech is possible. I
worship Him whom the Vedas describe as neti neti (not this, not this).
Him they, the sages, have called God of gods, the unborn, the unfallen,
the source of all.

1 Ashram Bhajanavali  is a collection of devotional songs which formed part of
the morning and evening prayers at Gandhiji’s ashrams. They were in various
languages and taken from various sources, some of them obscure, but all fairly
popular in Hindu religious tradition. Gandhiji rendered these into English for
Mirabehn’s benefit, in the first place, during his imprisonment in Yeravda Central
Prison. The work of translation was begun on May 6, 1930 and the last hymn was
translated on December 15.
In 1934 George Allen & Unwin Ltd. brought out an adaptation of the work by
John S. Hoyland. (For Gandhiji’s permission for its publication, vide “Letter to J. S.
Hoyland”, 15-12-1933.) But in order to make the poems acceptable to English
readers, Hoyland omitted a great deal, “chiefly Indian names and symbolism” but also
much else so that at places it is difficult to recognize the original in the adaptation.
See for instance Gandhiji’s translation of verse 8 and Hoyland’s adaptation of it (p.
388).
The version reproduced here is taken from a photostat of the original work in
Gandhiji’s hand (C. W. 4903).
2  Note by Gandhiji: “1st verse rewritten on 20-12-1930.” Gandhiji first wrote
it on May 6, again on November 20 and then finally on this date.324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI3

NOTE. This refers of course to the spiritual teacher. This is not a
mechanical or artificial relationship. The teacher is not all these in
reality but he is all that to the disciple who finds his full satisfaction in
him and imputes perfection to him who gave him a living faith in a
living God. Such a guru is a rarity, at least nowadays. The best thing is
to think of God Himself as one’s Guru or await the Light in faith.

Raghunath knows what love is. He sets aside all other bonds and

evil. Blessed is the king who walks along the right path, blessed is the
Brahmin who will not swerve from the faith, blessed is the moment
when one is in the company of the holy ones, blessed is the life that is
devoted to the unbroken worship of God.
Lives of holy men are beautiful like cotton; though tasteless the
fruit is white and durable. Those who bear the hardships of others and
relieve them attain fame on this earth and are adorable.
There is no doubt that one gets what one’s heart is truly set
upon. Nothing on this earth is difficult for him whose mind is
saturated with the thought of serving others.
It is the tradition of the Raghu clan handed down from time
immemorial that they would stake their life rather than break the
plighted word. Sins mountain-high cannot be heavier than untruth,
can crores of  ¿ææðÆUè1 outweigh a mountain?
The sages proclaim and the Vedas and the Puranas witness that
all good deeds depend for their merit on truth.

assistance of Rama, he responded when hardly his name was half

affliction. The touch of these feet enabled Prahlad to attain Indra’s
status, gave Dhruva permanent stability, enabled Vishnu to rule the
whole universe, gave the wife of Gautama her salvation, enabled
Krishna to show his powers among the shepherd lads and to capture
the Kali snake and to lift the mount Govardhana and thus humble the
pride of Indra. The servant Mira says that the touch of those feet
enables a man to cross the great ocean.

the wheel of life as one fears a rope for a snake and thus preventest
union between soul and the Maker. Do not put out the lamp of

Blessed is that family and that country where servants of God
take birth. God becomes their work and their religion. The three
worlds become holy through them. Tell me who have become
purified through pride of birth? The Puranas have testified like bards
without reserve that those called untouchables have attained salvation
through devotion to God. Tuladhar, the Vaishya, Gora, the potter,
Rohidas, a tanner, Kabir, a Momin, Latif, a Muslim, Sena, a barber, and
Vishnudas, Kanhopatra, Dadu, a carder, all become one at the feet of
God in the company of hymn singers. Chokhamela and Banka, both
Mahars by birth, became one with God. Oh, how great was the
devotion of Jani the servant girl of Namdev! Pandharinath (God)
dined with her. Meral Janak’s family no one knows, yet who can do
justice to his greatness? For the servant of God there is no caste, no

It is useless to sorrow over what God ordains. Without His will
we cannot move a blade of grass. If we do fuss about things, what is
left over is a legacy of sorrows. It is ignorance that prompts one to say
‘I have done this’, even as a dog under a cart fancies  himself
shouldering the weight of the cart. A few yogis only know that the
whole universe depends upon Him. If a man could dispose things, he
would root out all enemies and have only friends, he would have no
kings and no beggars, he would plant on every house flags
betokening (limitless possession of wealth). Even as a creeper gives in
its season leaves, fruit and flowers so does man receive what is his due
in due time; a foolish man only will therefore resort to vain
cogitations. Often does man write much and fails to say the right
thing. People worship what they like and they seem to believe
whole-heartedly that theirs is the only true belief. But Narsaiyo says

No matter what one does, self-denial will not last unless it is
based on dislike for the thing given up. If there is deep down the
desire for it, it will not be relinquished. A man may wear the garb of a
sannyasi but that will bring him no nearer the goal if the garb only
hides the desire that has its full possession of the wearer. So long as
desire, anger, greed and passion are not rooted out, the thing will
come to the surface the moment there is an opportunity; the very
sannyasa may become an additional source of self-indulgence. Just as
the seed does not sprout during the dry hot season but does so as soon
as the rains come, so is it with man’s desires; they await the due
season. Just as iron moves in front of a magnet so do the senses move
when they are face to face with their objects. They are still for want of
opportunity but they run riot as soon as the opportunity comes.
Therefore mere external renunciation will not answer if there is no
corresponding response within. Such external renunciation will mean
licence even from the restraints of Varnashrama (the four divisions)
and is likely to result in harm. Such a man becomes useless like milk
gone bad. It won’t yield ghee or butter and is unfit to drink.
Nishkulanand says: A man’s renunciation is wrong when he hovers
between self-denial and self-indulgence, household affairs and their
relinquishment.

The yogi has migrated to the forest. He has given up all love
of the body. He cares not to talk about the world, he has
becomeindifferent about its comforts. He who had richly upholstered
cots  and lived in palaces has not even straw to lie on, lives in the shade
of  trees. He who had rich shawls and embroidered robes now sports a
ragged blanket and bears heat and cold. He who had a variety of tasty
foods now lives upon pieces of chapati thrown in the begging bowl.
He  at whose call thousands answered and who was followed by large
armies is now wandering alone and unshod. O king, if you would stop
I  would prepare food for you; I would prepare rice puddings in no
time  and it will be put in your begging bowl. (The king answers:) He
who  waits for food, expects to have a dish, is no yogi, he is a
householder  desirous of enjoyment. He is doomed. He who gives up
his kingdom and  adopts sannyasa may not fix his mind on wealth
and family, he considers  all indulgence as a malady. Nishkulanand

adopts sannyasa, he has left his  family, it is true, but he has gained an

immovable like a rock in the face of temptations. They will perish
rather  than be weak in faith or patience. During the whole day they
never  allow themselves with the body. He is the true man who will not
indulge  the body. They move about in obedience to God’s will and

obtaining  salvation. Such a man when he comes in contact with such

God comes to us through devotion. If He did not come, we
should not be free from the bondage of birth and death. Devotion is a
means of attaining true bliss and makes birth on this earth worthwhile.
Even the Vedas testify that God comes to His devotees. He who is
prowess personified allows Himself to be tied up as if He was helpless.
He appears wherever His servants are in distress. He, the Lord of the
Universe, Fountain of Mercy is unattainable without devotion.
Meditations, austerities, vows and the like are useless without devotion.
Without it, wealth, youth, strength, intellect, cunning all these put
together are useless (if there is no devotion). Colour, beauty, family,
caste cannot help (where devotion is absent). Ajamil, Narad, Sabari,

The Lord is like the ocean—too big for the eyes to scan. The tongue
gets fatigued to tell of Him and so simply says He is vast. O God,
when will the spiritual sight be opened? When will this deep darkness
be dispelled? O God, listen to my petition and lift this dead curtain. O
my eyes, look deep and there is Hari. O eyes, get rid of the laziness
and calmly see Him. Just set the gaze upon Him and look at Him to
heart’s content.

459.  LETTER  TO  NARANDAS  GANDHI
SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13/16, 1930
CHI.  NARANDAS,
This time I got your packet at 12 noon on Wednesday.  I got a
copy of the booklet Gitabodh1.  I take it that those who make notes
about the work they do as yajna do so in their dairy.  If you remind
people often enough about this, they will be careful. See that everyone
is soon able to use the instruments for weighing yarn and testing its
strength.  I have replied to Mahadev’s questions in my letter to Durga,
and to questions about my health in my letter to Kakasaheb.
Therefore read both the letters.
Afternoon
There was a letter from Jayaprakash saying that Prabhavati    
would go over there.  She may have even arrived there before you get   
this letter.  If she comes, look after her very carefully.  She gets faint-  
ing  fits  and  these  should  stop  immediately  in  the  Ashram.  You
may  buy  any  fruits  which  may  be  necessary  for  her.  Consult  a
doctor if necessary.  You may write to me about her whenever you     
wish to.

I got Manilal’s letter. I felt relieved. Let him observe as many
restriction as he chooses, but not at the cost of his health. 110-115 lb.
is certainly low weight. Manilal should maintain his weight between
120 and 125; if, however, he has kept up his strength, he will regain
that level after he is released. He should guard against any disease
insidiously attacking him. The reading which he has done is quite
good, but in order to derive the fullest benefit from his work he
should carry out my suggestions as far as possible. Really speaking,
however, when he has the benefit of the company of a person like
Nanabhai1, and will now have the benefit of Mahadev’s company,
there should hardly be any need for me to guide him. The reading he
is doing at present is good indeed. There is little in it, however, to be
remembered and digested. The reading which I have suggested will,
while developing his memory and power of thinking, also
beinteresting to him. Jivanshodhan2 can be understood only if it is
read carefully twice or thrice. He is doing right in reading it once
again. One reason why my writings are easy to follow is that these
days I write with the sole aim of making myself easily understood by
all the inmates of the Ashram. Formerly too I wrote with the general
public in view, and not for men of learning. It is natural, therefore,
that my writings should be easy to understand. Let him write to me
again. He should write as often as he gets time and is permitted to do
so.
I have had no reply to my inquiry about Devdas’s letter. I have
even suggested that he should write again. If the Bombay air suits
Jamna, do not insist on her returning to the Ashram. Do you still
make bread there? If you do, of what quality are you able to make it,
and who actua-lly makes it? If it is of good quality and if anyone is
coming on a visit here, send a sample. You had described the process
of making it, but it did not succeed here. I have not been able to
discover where the error lay.
I can say that, up to this evening, the bhakhari  of jowar and
bajra seems to have done me no harm. I eat very little in bulk but can
keep up my strength all right. No one should worry on my account. I
will not be obstinate and cling to the experiment.

Pranayama (control of breath) and asanas (yogic postures) are
referred to appreciatively in this chapter, but we should remember that
at the same time the Lord has stressed the need for brahmacharya , i.e.,
keeping the observances calculated to take us nearer and nearer to
God. It should be clearly understood that the mere practice of asanas
and the like can never take us to the goal of even-mindedness. Asanas
and pranayama  may be of some slight help in steadying the mind and
making it single-purposed, provided that they are practised to that
end. Otherwise they are no better than other methods of physical
training. They are very useful indeed as physical exercise and I
believe that this type of exercise is good for the soul, and may be
performed from a bodily standpoint. But I have observed that these
practices do only harm when indulged in for the acquisition of
supernormal powers ( siddhi) and the performance of miracles. This
chapter should be studied as a summary of the teaching in the
preceding three chapters. It cheers us up in our spiritual struggle. We
should never be down-hearted and give up the endeavour to reach
evenness of temper.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
December 16, 1930
DEAR SISTER,
Please send me four pounds of cotton. Kakasaheb’s place is
now taken by Pyarelal. He spins faster and, therefore, a greater
quantity of cotton will be consumed than formerly. Kindly inform the
people you buy the cotton from, that it is full of particles and seeds.
As a result, we have to spend much time in cleaning it and some of the
cotton is wasted.
I hope I do not give you too much trouble. I do believe that, if
you store cotton for my sake, you will also be able to use it for other
purposes.
I hope all your sisters are quite well.

CHI. MANU,
I got your letter. Though you are so near the Ashram, I do not
send this letter along with the other post for the Ashram, and delay its
reaching you by some days. Instead, I am taking the risk and writing
it directly to you. I believe you will get it. Why do you give way to
despair? One who believes in God can never feel despair. Since you
are very eager to work, you earn merit as if you had been actually
working. Why, then, do you feel impatient? Who knows for what
service God has destined you? Or how can we say that your
aspirations in themselves are not sufficient for His work? You do
perform the daily yajna of spinning; what else is it, if not service?
Start repeating Ramanama and rouse yourself. Shake off despair.
Banish the very thoughts of weakness and disease. If you take interest
in the Gita and the Ramayana , go on repeating to yourself verses
from them. Write to me direct. And write often.

463. LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA
YERAVDA MANDIR,
December 16, 1930
BHAI GHANSHYAMDASJI,
I have your letter. Even if I agree to see you I am afraid the
permission will not be granted. Therefore for the time being, we must
be content with letters alone. By speculation I did not mean that no
forward transactions should be entered into. Speculation means
gambling. With the expectation that market prices will go up I buy
1,000 bales of cotton. I do not need any cotton, I do not even store it
in any warehouse. Only a book transaction is made. Now I await a rise
in price. I sell the cotton when it rises; this I consider gambling. The
nation or, rather, the world has lost a great deal through suchVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1932 411transactions. This was what I meant in my letter1. Yes, I expect much
more than this, but, at present, you will not be up to that. Without at all
depending upon future market prices, to sell the commodities at a
little more than the cost price is what I consider unsullied trade. Today
it might be difficult to conduct such business, but ultimately, it might
bear fruit. You might remember this is what I visualize for khadi. But
I know this is a tall order. I shall be very happy and content if you
brothers can give up speculation. However, do only what is
intelligently acceptable and within your power. I would not at all wish
that you should act upon the suggestion simply because it happens to
be mine and that, too, sent from jail. Faith should not have a place
where reasoning is applicable.
Jayaprakash informs me that, although you are not recruiting
any new people just now, he will be absorbed somewhere because of
my recommendation2. I certainly hold that Jayaprakash is a worthy
young man but I do not wish that a post be created where none exists
today.
I was a little worried to read of Malaviyaji’s fever in the news-
papers. I am relieved now. I hope he will emerge from the jail in good
health. I am glad about your health too. I am again experi- menting
with a milkless diet. This time constipation was res- ponsible for it.
Now I am taking chapatis prepared from millet for the prisoners,
vegetables, three tolas of almonds and dates. I am trying to give up
dates. Constipation has disappeared. I shall revert to milk if I lose
strength. It is nearly a month since I gave up milk.
Yours,

Your letter. I have in general given the literal translation of
Bhajanavali3. Now it is up to Mirabehn. I do not consider the
translation worth publishing. It cannot even be published while I am

on different occasions. We might say that all are well liked. But I do
wish to drop a few in the new edition. In “Who is not devoted to
Rama and Vaidehi”1 I take Rama to mean Daridranarayana  and it is
our duty to forsake the company of one who does not serve
Daridranarayana . Non-co-operation emanates from that.
Thanks for making a start in Gujarati. Considering all this
connection with Gujarat, it is good to learn the language too. As a
matter of fact, the more Indian languages one knows the better.
I do not use the enema regularly. I regard it efficacious to use
only when the need arises. To use it daily is not good. It can also
prove harmful.
My blessings to the children. I hope the ear-trinkets taken off
have not been replaced. My hope is that now the children would have
become simpler than ever before.

YERAVDA MANDIR,
December 18, 1930
CHI. KASHINATH,
A person without art is like a beast. But how will you define art?
Art is “skill in work”. The yoga of the third chapter of the Gita is
perfect art. And this is also true about the activities generally known as
art. Any activity in which the masses cannot participate is not art, but a
kind of self-indulgence, whether it concerns the voice or clothes or
stone. Large numbers singing Ramdhun  in unison is art, which ought
to be cultivated. Many temples have art, and their art is something
which can be appreciated by the masses. The daily worship and
readings from holy books which take place in temples, if kept within
measure and done with genuine faith, are the best form of art. Thus,
there is art wherever harmony prevails as regards the time, the place
and the occasion. I do not like films. I have never gone to a cinema.

Before you can throw off tenderness you will have to realize
that it is bad. I am quite clear that you should not take Rs. 25 for
clearing the debt to Father-in-law. There is no hurry about paying it
off. It is good for you to nurse the feeling that you should pay. As
you become hardy, you might save something out of Rs. 75. But you
may not deny yourself necessaries. You will have an opportunity later
of being able to repay the debt.

476. LETTER TO MIRABEHN
YERAVDA MANDIR,
4.30 p.m., December 20, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
Your letter betrays about my health an anxiety which is wholly
unnecessary. The weight which was taken on Thursday showed an
increase of 11/2 1b., a very good increase in seven days. Nor do I feel
any weakness. I do my two hours’ spinning on the takli standing as a
rule without feeling any appreciable fatigue. I have just now sat down
to write this after finishing the takli. All the mistakes made last time
are being avoided. Stools are well formed. Pyarelal tells me there is no
smell worth noticing. The food is all well cooked, i.e., vegetables and
chapati. The letter is rebaked when I receive it. Last time, you should
remember, it was all raw food including cereals and pulses.1 As a
matter of fact, I am now taking practically what I was taking before
starting the raw cereals. The only difference is taking bajri or jwari in
the place of wheat. Perhaps it is a change for the better. I am taking
once boiling water, lemon and salt. In spite of all this apparent
improve [ment] if I find any irregularity about the stools or weakness
(persistent) or a continuing decrease in weight, in any one of the three
things happening, I shall go back to milk. But just now with the good
feel about the health I must not deprive myself of the joy of avoiding
milk and taking the bajri or jwari chapati. And what is more, I like the
1 In Bapu’s Letter to Mira, Mirabehn explains; “I had reminded Bapu in a letter
of the severe attack of dysentery he had had at the end of a previous food experiment
he had carried out in Sabarmati Ashram.418 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHItaste of these chapatis. This detailed explanation and description
ought to give you and other friends full satisfaction and free you
from all worry as to the future.
In my opinion, while it is necessary, so far as you are concern-
ed, to keep a watch on your menu, your chief trouble is mental. Any
pressure on the mind reacts immediately on your body. This anxiety
complex, you should try to throw off. “Be careful for no- thing.”
“Look at the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither do they spin and
yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.” I do
not know whether I have quoted correctly. Anyhow the lilies only
seem neither to toil nor to spin. They do both but so naturally that we
do not notice their toilsome spin. If they did not toil, they would
wither. Only they have not the egotism and hence attachments, likes
and dislikes that we have. But when we toil like them detachedly, our
toil will not be noticed and therefore will not adversely affect the
body.
7.30 p.m.
You and I and all of us have to make a conscious and deliberate
effort to realize this blessed state. Or else, our reading of the Gita is
vain.
You will take care not to burn yourself with the primus. You
know how Gujarati women have burnt themselves over the use of the
primus. The loose saris lend themselves to the wick especially at the
time of lighting it. As it is kept on the floor, they have to bend and the
rising flame easily catches a fold or a loose end of the sari. It may be
wise for you, therefore, to keep it on a metalmounted stool. Then too
there is precious little room in your little dormitory. Anyway, you
have my warning. You will now take what precautions you may think
right.
In my seclusion, the idea of your bringing out a paper does not
at all commend itself to me. That ties you down and I should like you
to remain free for what comes to your lot. And then the paper will
absorb the labour of several others. I dread the idea. But my opinion
has no value. You and the other workers are the best judges.
Yes, I have jut finished the first part of the introduction to my
translation of the Gita1. I hope to do at least a paragraph every day. If
I succeed, the introduction cannot take long.
The new Gandiv2 has almost all the improvements I had
contemplated. It has two springs for the two mals. It is working like a
1 Anasaktiyoga
2 A new type of spinning-wheelVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1932 419musical instrument and requires very little attention. For the execu-
tion of these improvement I am thankful to the Superintendent and an
English co-prisoner, who is a clever mechanic and who takes a serious
interest in the work. He has applied the spring to the holder in an
original way. The idea is incredibly simple and equally effective. But I
must not keep you over this any longer.
I am glad you have taken Surendra in hand. It is criminal how
he neglects his body. Even St. Francis, though he called his body an
ass, took some care of it. And after all the ass is a most useful and
patient animal. The brother ass can be equally useful if properly
treated and neither pampered nor neglected.
And now here is the first verse of the morning prayer :
“Early in the morning, I call to mind that Being which is felt in
the heart, which is sat (the eternal), chit (knowledge), sukham (blis),
which is the state reached by perfect men and which is the super-state.
I am that immaculate Brahman which ever notes the states of dream,
wakefulness and deep sleep, not this body, the compound made of the
elements (earth, water, space, light and air).” You will be interested to
know that the first verse was commended on 6th May last.1
I am sorry that the very first verse needed correcting. The more
I think, the more clearly I see the meaning. And then I don’t mind
how often I cut about the translation. Formerly I used to shudder to
utter this verse thinking that the claim made therein was arrogant. But
when I saw the meaning more clearly, I perceived at once that it was
the very best thought with which to commence the day. It is a solemn
declaration that we are not the changeful bodies which require sleep,
etc., but deep down, we are the Being, the witness pervading the
countless bodies. The first part is the recalling to mind the presence of
the vital principle and the second part is the affirmation that we are
that vital principle. The description of the Being, the Brahman, is also
quite apposite. It is, nothing else is (sat), it is all knowledge or light
(chit), and naturally, therefore, it is all bliss (sukham) or the word
generally used is  anand. The rest is simple. You will compare this
translation with what you have already, translated by Valjibhai. If
there is a material difference, let me have his translation. In
scholarship I should yield the palm to him. So now God willing, you
may expect a present of this character every week. And here goes the

Its enthusiasm pleased me. But, according to our principle, I cannot

There is again no letter from you.1 How is that? You should not
put off writing till the last day. You should write early. From
Narandas’s letter I thought that your letter would be enclosed but it
was not. This is your third lapse. Do not commit it a fourth time.

December 22, 1930
CHI. GANGABEHN (SENIOR),
It no doubt puts a very heavy responsibility on us when parents
of grown-up girls entrust them to us. God will help us to bear it.
When, however, you feel in a particular case that the responsibility will
be beyond your strength, plainly refuse to accept it. Sent away any
girl who refuses to submit to your discipline. Explain the position
clearly to the parents and the girl before you accept her. If we do not
take such steps of practical wisdom, God will not help us. He never
helps the timid, the lethargic and those who are not vigilant.
Have any facilities you require, but safeguard your health. If
you think that tea and coffee are essential for it, take either without the
slightest hesitation or without feeling ashamed about doing so. Giving
up tea or coffee is not at present the purpose of your sadhana; that
purpose is the service of those among the inmates of the Ashram who
suffer.
I cannot think of one single remedy which will help Madhu and
all others in the Ashram who suffer from constipation. I will tell you
how I overcame it in my case. For three or four days, I ate only
cooked greens like tanka. That completely restored my bowel
movement. Then I added almonds to the diet. You do not need them
for the people there. Perhaps you will not get even greens. But you
can certainly get onions. If those who suffer from constipation eat
boiled onions, that, too, will probably help them. If you can get
tomatoes, you may mix them with onions. If simple boiled onions do
not taste well, even with the addition of salt, and if tomatoes are not
available, they may use kokum.
The persons may try shirshasan . It has helped people to
overcome constipation from which they had suffered many years. The
asana should be done only on an empty stomach. It is quite easy to
do. The skirt should be tucked up behind and one should stand on
one’s head, supporting the body against a wall. After some practice
the support of the wall will not be necessary. The head should be
supported by the palms joined together.
I suppose you know that these days I eat the rotlas of jowar and
bajra, and vegetables, served to prisoners in jail. The vegetables          
for me have to be cooked separately, because those cooked424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfor other prisoners contain spices. I continue to eat dates. In place of
milk I take four tolas of almonds. I keep fairly good health. If I do
not keep it up, I will resume milk.

485. LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK
YERAVDA MANDIR,
December 22, 1930
CHI. PREMA,
I got your letter full of information. Both the meanings of nij-
anamagrahi1 are good. The meaning suggested by Narandas may suit
Gujarati better, but the one suggested by you is not altogether in-
appropriate. I imagine that you yourself are a little girl and reply to
your question about prayer. Just as we have parents who gave birth to
us, so they had their parents who brought them into the world. If we
go further and further back like this, He whom we can conceive as the
Father of all is God. It is because He is that that we also call Him the
Creator. As our parents often come to know what we want without our
telling them, so does God know our wishes. If our human parents have
this power to know what we want, the Creator of all must have
infinitely greater power to know our heart. That is why we also think
of God as Antaryami , the Dweller within. It is not necessary that we
should be able to see Him. We have never seen a good many of our
relations. Somebody’s parents may have gone away to a foreign
country or died while he or she was a child, but such a man or woman
trusts other people and believes that the parents live or lived. Similarly,
we should trust the testimony of saints about the existence of God and
believe that the Antaryami  does exist. If that is so, it is easy to
understand why we should sing bhajans to Him and pray to Him. If
we are good children, we bow to our parents, prostrating ourselves
before them, the first thing in the morning after leaving bed and the
last thing at night when going to bed. We should do the same to God.
And as we tell our parents what we desire, so we should tell God. This
should be enough for today. If you do not understand anything in
this, do not hesitate to question me.

I got the two boxes of dates and the cotton send by you. Need I

YERAVDA MANDIR,
December 22, 1930
CHI. LILAVATI,
You are being really tested. See that you do not fail in the test.
One preserves one’s self-respect better by giving up the very desire
for being respected. You will not get another Gangabehn who will
look after you like a mother as she does. She has an overbearing
temper. Endure it. Understand and appreciate her zeal for service and
her sympathy for all. Anyone who wishes to serve must learn to act as
a member of an organization. To do this means to obey somebody’s
authority. One’s superior has his or her superior too. Think over the
verses of Chapter XII of the Gita. One of them says that a devotee and
lover of God is equally indifferent to respect and disrespect, to praise
and censure, and holds friend and foe in equal regard. Let this be true
about you. Do not feel it a burden to write to me.

But it is not clear from your letters whether you have. I should like
you to go to the Ashram as soon as possible. I do not like your

489. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
Thursday Morning, December 18/23, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your packet yesterday evening. The letters to the Ashram
which I handed in this time, that is, on Tuesday last, should reach you
on Thursday, that is, today. I suggested to the official here to post
them immediately, if possible, and he told me afterwards that this
week’s letters were posted on Tuesday itself.
I welcome your long letters, but I shall not be happy if you take
special trouble to make them long. I can understand what a burden
you are carrying. I did not want an explanation in regard to Keshu.
But I can understand your having given it so that you could your
pour out your heart and satisfy yourself.
I had a postcard from Surajbhan, in which he says that he would
be happy if Yashodadevi was called to the Ashram. She lives with the
family of Lala Dunichand, a lawyer, in Ambala. Write to him.
The Ratilal episode is both happy and painful. His foolishness is
painful, but the display of humanity by the merchant, who returned
the diamond, and by Gopi, who returned the money, makes oneVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1932 427happy. In my eyes, their subsequent conduct wipes out their initial
guilt. Champa, of course, has always been foolish. She listens to no
persuasion and re-mains fond of diamonds and other jewels, and loses
money in conse-quence. Ratilal must have returned. Even if he has
not returned, that will not worry me. God always saves him. But this is
what life is. We pass our time in undoing the consequences of one
another’s error. For those who can remain unattached while doing
this, their labour is not wasted. To them it is a spiritual striving and
they realize God through it. I had an experience of this yesterday
when I saw God in a worm and a weevil. You are wrong if you think
that you know Pyarelal fully. Being a poet, he is bound to be
dreaming always. I asked him to remove a worm from the dates. He
should have put it in a safe corner, but, instead of thinking about his
duty, he was thinking of something else, God knows what, and he put
the worm in the wash-basin. The weevil, too, was dropped into the
same. If now I washed my hands or face in the basin, I would be the
cause of the death of both. I therefore, decided not to wash in it. But
when, after I had finished my work, I got ready to wash my hands, I
did not see the worm and the weevil in the basin. They had slowly
moved away. I look upon this experience as seeing God in the two
worms. An atheist or a rationalist would describe the incident as mere
accident. It was an accident, no doubt, but seeing God is also an
accident. If we but understand the truth, we would see Him every day;
otherwise our whole life would pass without our seeing Him. But I will
not dwell further on this. I wanted to note this incident in the diary
yes-terday, but, in my preoccupation with other work I wrote in it only
about the daily sacrificial work and forgot to note this. While writing
about the merchant and Gopi, I remembered this holy experience and
have shared it with you. I learnt much else, too, from it yesterday. God
alone knows whether I shall be able to digest all that. I will now answer
your question here. As we reflect deeper and remain peaceful, the
meaning of ahimsa and truth becomes clearer. I even realize the
supreme utility of these two. I believe we realize God in the degree to
which we practise them. I am gett-ing more convinced than ever in my
view that seeing God except through truth and ahimsa is an
impossibility. How can members of a group practise ahimsa towards
one another? They can do so by displaying generosity towards co-
workers and their faults and everyone regarding his own faults with
strictness. Anyone who observes the faults of others believes, whether
he is conscious of the fact or not, that he does not have the same428 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfaults. This gives rise to pride. The true rule is that one should oneself
observe all rules strictly and tolerate others who seem slack in
observing them. This is not kindness but strict justice. Do we really
know what effort is made by a person in observing a rule even as
slackly as he does? If our seeming strictness in observing rules comes
naturally to us, what is the value of that strictness? Is it any cause for
wonder if a man like Bhima can lift a weight of four pounds with the
utmost ease? A girl, however, might slip down while trying to lift one
pound; what would we think of that Bhima if he laughed at her then?
Really speaking, the effort of that girl to lift one pound is of much
greater value than Bhima’s lifting the weight of four pounds. If
Bhima had not lifted that weight, somebody else as strong would have
lifted it; but by her effort to lift one pound that girl taught the world a
lesson in doing one’s duty and earned God’s grace. Our dharma
therefore does not lie in criticizing others and thereby commiting
violence; it lies in becoming more vigilant ourselves. If a strong
bullock is yoked with one seemingly or really weak, the former’s duty
is to do more work and make up for the deficiency of the latter. The
driver goads it to labour harder. If the strong bullock does not do the
work expected of it, it is looked upon as a shirker; it is selfish and has
no pity on the other one. Let us never be shirkers. Let us always do
our duty. God will judge us and our co-workers. He can see into the
hearts of all. We scarcely can see into our own. We easily learn this if
we strive sincerely to cultivate ahimsa.
Through the pursuit of truth, we know the measure of purity in
our motives. It increases our vigilance in regard to the smallest social
duties and to our daily work. If we strive for truth, we would not be
content merely to attend prayers but would try to concentrate our
attention on them. We would try to follow the songs and the dis-
courses, be punctual in attending the prayers and respond to them as
to a fresh experience every day. The freshness does not consist in the
variety of bhajans or other recitations, but should result from the
increasing purity of our heart. We should grow daily more contented
and feel greater peace of mind. If we do not have this experience, the
fault will lie not with the quality of the prayers but with the element of
untruth-fulness in us. If we attend the prayers with sincere devotion to
truth, we would experience nothing but peace. The faithful who visit
temples do not observe the lack of cleanliness in them, or pay
attention to the hypocrisy of the priest. They do not see the image as a
stone. They experience peace in the midst of noise and return fromVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1932 429the temples purified in heart. A person like me who feels suffocated
by the noise there and sees the image only as a piece of stone should
never visit a temple. God appears to us in the form in which we
worship Him. For He is not outside of us. He is in the hearts of us all.
If we understand this truth, our simplest and smallest actions would
shed lustre on us and help us to see God. In order that we may learn
this, prayers, spinning, and other daily duties are like a spiritual
lighthouse to us or a right angle which is the standard of
measurement.
Saturday Morning
If Giriraj remains quiet, that problem will then be over. I see that
it will not be possible now to get the children to the Ashram. He has
entrusted them [to somebody else]. Trust them to their fate now. I am
going on quite well at present. I have gained a pound or a pound and
a half in weight this week. I cannot say that I have at last succeeded in
giving up dates and raisins. Only a few days ago, Jamnabehn and
Vithaldas sent some dates and I ate them for two or three days. And
now again I have stopped eating them. I am thus observing the effect
of eating them and not eating them. I do want to give them up if I
can. At present, therefore, my diet includes a little quantity of greens
or cabbage or beetroot or turnip or pumpkin, bhakhari of bajra or
jowar, four tolas of almonds, and lemon. If God keeps me fit with
these, so far so good; otherwise I will humbly resume milk or curds. I
cannot say yet that I am able to live on this diet. I will not say, either,
that I shall not be able to do so. I had never expected that I would be
able to digest jowar and bajra. At present, however, I seem to have no
difficulty in doing so.
I have noted what you say about yourself. Your selection of the
items and their quantities is correct. I see that you have given up
ground-nuts; there is nothing wrong in that. The fact that you are
losing weight will do you no harm at all. You should not lose strength,
however. If you find it necessary, increase the quantity of milk or
curds. It will per-haps help you if you add just one tola of almonds to
your diet. Solve the problem of Parnerkar firmly. It seems to have
turned out a painful chapter. I got the chapters of Gitabodh . So far I
have not received the piece of leather.
You may extract from any of my letters what I say about the
yajna of spinning and publish it. There is no harm in publising
similar other material of public interest. The more the people do
yajna for self-purification, the better. A mass yajna has an altogether430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImiraculous effect. If you can, keep up with what you have started. The
spinning-wheels and all other things must be in perfect condition.
These things produce an effect on our minds and make a difference
to the speed. Your speed has increased well enough. I have not been
able to go beyond 200 on the spinning-wheel and 60 on the talki. But
I do hope to do so. I do not know if there is something wrong with
my fingers. If the nerves running through them are weak, it is possible
that they may not be active enough. Just as you go to bed early, it will
also be good if you make it a rule not to rise earlier than a fixed hour.
You should do what you can between 4 and 9 and then stop. If you
have more things to do than you can finish during that time, you may
omit those which you safely can. You should entrust to others the
things which they can attend to. It is really not necessary to give you
advice in this matter, but I have said something all the same in order
that you may be more careful. One test of non-attachment is that a
person who is non-attached always feels as if he had no work, though
he is never inactive even for a single moment. At present, however,
that state of mind “is a wish beyond our reach”. All the same, we
should grasp with our intellect the meaning of that verse and, having
done so, strive to reach that state. The condition of a non-attached
person should never seem pitiable. He should never have an
expression on his face which might make anybody feel sorry for him
and think that he was carrying an excessive burden of work. Think
what “burden” of work God has to carry. Nevertheless He is the king
of those who do not work. He is an object of pity to no one. On the
contrary, we hunger for His mercy. We should never be satisfied with
a state a whit inferior to His, though He may carry the burden of the
entire universe and we that of something smaller than even a particle
of dust. Just as He ever feels light, though carrying the burden of the
universe, so should we do though carrying the burden of a mere
fraction of a particle of dust. We can easily attain such a state of mind
if we reduce ourselves to a cipher. Mirabehn finds it impossible to
become non-attached, but she is a good woman and, therefore, will
one day approach that state. From here I think she would do well not
to undertake the responsibility of a new paper. I had understood
about Sitla Sahay even without a letter from him, and that is why I
wished to get one from him.
I do not like to give to anyone the impression of my palm.
Apart from that, it would be against jail rules to do so. I have,
therefore, no choice in the matter. Kakasaheb could not even give his
signature on his photograph. And I think that it is a good rule too. IVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1932 431have written a letter1 to Purushottam; read it. Kanu, too, seems to have
been upset a bit.
Sunday Morning
It was not at all satisfied by . . . ’s2 letter. I take it that you will
see him personally, or probably you have already seen him. Discuss
the matter with him and convey to me the impression you form. This
case, too seems like . . . ’s3. The latter would not admit anything more
than what had come out and produced an impression on Surendra,
Chhaganlal and others that nothing wrong had happened. He did not
succeed in producing that impression on me, and ultimately confessed
having been guilty of a serious lapse. I would not be surprised if a
similar thing should happen in . . . ’s4 case. His language gives the
impression of a guilty person attacking an innocent. Look into this.
Kusum has referred in her letter to the problem that has arisen
about the offer of a job to her in Porbandar. Read my reply to her
and guide her as you think best. My compliments to Jaya for having
gone to the rest-house5. Has she any relation there to whom I can
write? If Kakasaheb has not been able to win over the others, I think it
would be best to let the Gita recitation go on as at present. The
suggestion to complete the whole recitation in seven days by reciting
some verses in the morning and some in the evening has not appealed
to me. I will congratulate ourselves if we can improve upon the
present practice. I have noted that you took two and three-quarter
hours to write your letter to me. The time taken in dispatching the
letters must have been in addition to this. It is fine indeed if you can
get all this time. If you can reduce it a little, however, you should
certainly do so.
I see that I made an amusing mistake about Vidyabehn6. I will
be more careful in future when several persons claim the same name.
I think you did right in detaining Bhagwanjibhai’s7 Manibehn.
She will be welcome to the Ashram when the two reach a level so that
they feel as brother and sister to each other. At present it is best that
they remain away from each other.

DEAR FRIEND,
I was glad to hear from you. If the R.T.C. results in doing
something worthy of the great sacrifice of the nation and therefore of
acceptance, I should be delighted. But as I have told you, having been
filled with distrust nothing but an accomplished result will reassure
me.

followed, vide “Letters on the Gita”,  21-2-1932.VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1932 433The question of debts is incredibly simple. The Lahore
resolution has an explicit condition about reference to an impartial
tribunal.1 But you have my assurance that no Congressman has ever
enunciated the doctrine of total repudiation. What Congressmen,
including myself, demand is that the nation’s representatives should
have the right of having any portion of the so-called national debt,
concessions and the like, being referred to an independent tribunal
whose decision should be final and binding on both the parties. I feel
I am quite safe in saying this even for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Not to
adopt the course above indicated would be disloyal to the nation as
total repudiation without just cause would undoubtedly be disho-
nourable.
Whatever Maulana Mohamed Ali may think of me, I have
nothing but kindly feelings about him. And I feel sure that time will
remove misunderstandings. Having no feeling either against Islam or
Mussalmans, I feel absolutely at ease.

I have your letter. I invariably write to you. But if I fail to do so,
you too do not write to me. I agree to this condition, though children
should not insist on this. You have each to write one letter to me and I
have to write one letter to each; but I have thousands or lakhs of

Does the doctor say that your ear-drum has been damaged, and
that, if it cannot be cured, it would be advisable to remove it? If that is
so, you should get it removed even at the risk of certain deafness
which might result from its removal, and save yourself from the
present pain. Is there a continual discharge from the ear? You should
not ignore this disease. I am still able to carry on without milk.

It is not unlikely that you will get this letter. It is the same to us

CHI. KASHINATH,
I got your letter. I fully approve of what you did about Shanta’s
husband. It is enough if Shanta keeps up her courage. Whatever
happens, Shanta should refuse to go to him. Let him, if he wishes,
come again to attack her. She should resist if he comes to carry her
away by force. She should not be alone at any time. You need not
take the trouble to find out where the man has gone. It is enough that
you have written about it to his people at home. Be vigilant lest he
come stealthily and attack her again. If Mother is of the same mind as
you in this matter, you will meet with no difficulty in following the
course which you have adopted.
I have already replied to the question regarding marriage. I see
that it is not enough, and also that it is. I have only pointed out the
Vedic ideal modified to suit modern times. If one is unable to follow
it, one may modify it further as much as necessary. It is not for me to
take measure of anyone’s inability in this regard.442 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII don’t mind your having written about Gangabehn. She is not
intentionally partial to anyone. She may act in that manner through
haste and lack of understanding. However, she is the fittest to be the
women’s leader. For Kalavati and others, therefore, service lies in
doing as she says, and they ought to be satisfied with that. They
should not lose heart if people give no co-operation in the work
regarding cleanliness, khadi, etc. In the long run people are bound to
yield to love and their daily experience of other people’s conduct.
Their presence by itself is enough in such places, provided they spend
the whole day in work. And they must carry the takli and the
spinning-wheel with them. They should also clean people’s latrines,
etc.

I have your letter. If you regarded the world as unreal, i.e.,
transitory, does it in any way go contrary to reason? Whatever is
transitory is unreal because it does not endure for ever. And there is
no question of being attached to what is transient. After all you will
seldom find reason being exercised in matters of faith. If it could be
grasped by reason it ceases to be a matter of faith. Faith might indeed
one day lead to experience.

512. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
Saturday Morning, December 27/30, 1930
CHI. NARANDAS,
This time I got your packet only yesterday (Friday) after 2
o’clock. Because of Christmas there seems to have been some
confusion in the post office. Here the officials seem quite carefulVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1932 443about my post. That is why you got my packet on Thursday.
I got the piece of leather for sandals. I see Mahadev’s name in
your list, but I did not find his letter. Perhaps there was a letter by
Durga, but I do not find even that. I did feel that Ratilal would return.
Where had he gone on his pleasure trip? Send with a visitor some time
a sample of the bread which you make there. We do not know when
Giriraj will see reason. Go on doing your best. His heart is pure and
he is filled with the spirit of self-sacrifice. One day, therefore, he is
bound to see reason. “No one seeking to do good ever comes to
harm.”1
I understand everyone being nervous about my experience in
diet, for I have not fully succeeded in it. But perhaps you may tell
people that you know that I wake up in time and make necessary
changes, and that my body responds to them. How can I give up a
dharma which has come to me unsought? I was weighed yesterday
and again seemed to have gained a pound and a half. I advisedly say
“seemed” because on the previous occasion I was weighed after I had
passed stool and this time before I had done so. The weight of the
stool is not real gain in weight, but an unnecessary load. We may
therefore count half a pound less; even then there has been a gain of
one pound. But more important than the weight is the energy which I
feel in my body. I feel no sign of weakness yet. I eat without
difficulty one bhakhari  of the size which they make here, half a piece
at one meal. The quantity of almonds which I eat comes to nearly two
ounces. At present at any rate I feel that, if I can continue to digest
this amount of food, I shall be able to keep up my strength.There is,
therefore, no reason at all for worry. I am taking the utmost care, and,
after all, even in this matter one needs to practise non-attachment.
Who can say when that thing, more fragile than glass, will slip from
one’s hand and break?
I suppose you remember that you sent to Kantu2 a diary made
of handmade paper. He has now sent it for my autograph. The
binding is very bad. Not only that there is no neatness about it, but he
has so bound it that one cannot turn the pages at all. The art of
binding books is easy to learn. It can be learnt in a very short time.
Someone from among us should learn it. Or we should get our
binding done outside. I intend to get the diary re-bound in the press
here. This is just by the way. I have mentioned the matter for future
1 Bhagavad Gita , VI. 40
2 Kantilal Gajiwala; vide “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 5/9-9-1930.444 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIguidance. “Yoga is skill in work.”1 This should be illustrated even in
our least important activities. “Skill in work” lies also in not
attempting what we cannot do. That is a case of action in inaction.
Even refraining from something is a form of action. There is a saying
in English borrowed from Persian. “He who knows that he knows not
is wise.” I am prompted to say all this form my own unhappy
experience. I observe that my spinning displays too much evidence of
lack of skill and slackness despite all the care that I take. There may
be a knot in the thread which I observe, but I let it go. At times the
yarn is much too loose, but I let it remain. I have acquired no
proficiency at all in joining broken thread. But I go on, all the same.
What kind of yajna is this? Whether you call it carelessness, laxity or
indifference, I observe every day this weakness in me in regard to this
great yajna of spinning. I try every day to improve myself, and fail.
But I keep hoping that one day I shall do well in my yajna. Even if I
do not, I derive consolation from the verse : “After man lives, the
enlightened one attains Me”2. It is a dangerous verse. One may use it
to remain content with one’s lethargy. If a person pays attention to
the meaning of every word in it, he will not fall, otherwise the verse
can be the cause of much harm to one. I hear the bugle sounded
every day at 5.30. It is now time for me to pace up and down.
7.30, Tuesday
If you send your packet by unregistered parcel, it may per- haps
be delayed. Make inquiries, however, and do what you think best. This
time I have been hard pressed for time to cope with the work.
Ordinarily, I should be spinning at this hour. I get letters from
Prabhavati from time to time. She should arrive in the Ashram any
day now. Drop me a postcard as soon as she arrives. Most probably I
shall get it. Read my letters to Kaka and Mirabehn. Today I stop here.

December 29/30, 1930
CHI. MIRA,
Your letter. This time I must be very brief as the post came two
days late. I start therefore with the translation of the 2nd verse1: “In
the early morning I worship Him who is beyond the reach of thought
and speech yet by whose grace all speech is possible. I worship Him
whom the Vedas describe as neti, neti (not this). Him they (the sages)
have called God of gods, the unborn, the unfallen, the source of all.”
I do not think that this calls for any explanation. The translation
of the preface2 is proceeding apace. And as there was no Ashram post
till Friday, I devoted the spare time to translating more paras. The
result is that now there are only 10 more left. It will be time then to
consider whether I can translate the Gita notes I am writing for the
Ashram inmates. Just now the 100 rounds on the takli take up much
time. But I am now showing an increase in speed. The speed on the
Gandiv today was for me quite a record, i.e., 169 rounds in 40
minutes. This means 255 in 60 minutes. The improvements are
primarily responsible for this speed. If I continue to show
improvement, I may have some more time for writing work. For I do
not want to be greedy just now in the way of increase in the output. I
shall stick to 300 on the wheel and 100 on the takli till I show a
permanently marked increase in speed.
I was quite sure you would get your foreign mail.
Of my health which is excellent more in the general letter.
Of your journalistic venture my opinion remains unaltered and
is reinforced by the recent ordinance. But, as I have said, my opinion
ought not to count one way or the other.
Love.

I have your letter. Let me give my blessings just now for the new
year. If you take a vow, do so after full deliberation and, having taken
one be firm in keeping it. There is no need at all to undertake a seven
days’ fast. It is likely to prove too much for you. It is enough if you
fast on the birthday. Write to Shankarbhai and to me and tell us what
vow you take. Take the vow in the presence of the girl friends living
there. If possible, spend that day with Kusumbehn. It would be good
before taking your vow to consult her. The difficulty which you point
out about eating food without spices is only an excuse. One who is
determined to eat unspiced food will certainly find out what to eat.
Surely, there are no chillies in rotla, rice and buttermilk. [Is it not so?]
One should be satisfied with a rotla, buttermilk and salt. Just as we eat
and drink every day, we should also write the diary every day.
Everything can be done if one has the will. Kamu has not
acknowledge my letter. Ask her whether she got it. What will her
husband do at Ahmedabad?
How can anyone say that there is no sin in killing bugs and
fleas? Even in cutting up vegetables there is sin. However, we do
commit some sins which we regard as unavoidable. When we smoke a
place to protect ourselves against fleas, countless fleas are killed, but
we feel helpless and do that all the same. However, we realize through
such necessities that it is everyone’s duty to seek deliverance from
bodily life.

For want of time, only this much now. I have understood your
problem with the  takli. Do you have that problem with the bamboo
one or the iron  takli? Your faith will produce the right means even in
material things for you. Hence, be patient. For the present, keep a
watch on how much yarn the Magan spinning-wheel, in its existing
form, gives. You should not have any problem when a devotee of the
Magan spinning-wheel, i.e. Dhiru, is with you. If the takli has started
giving 330 rounds of yarn per hour, why cannot the Magan-wheel
give 3330 rounds per hour? Do not be alarmed by it. Initially, the
takli gave only 30 rounds, now it easily gives ten times more. It is not
impossible to produce on Magan wheel ten times more than the  takli.

to take care of themselves? If Jayaprakash cannot go immediately,
cannot he ask Harasubabu?  I see that the longer you delay in going
to the Ashram, the weaker you are becoming.  What further can I now
write even to Jayaprakash?
What is your diet in your present condition of health?  Who
watches over you when you are in a swoon?  What did Father tell you
when you met him?  I feel afraid even to ask you questions, for it may
be a burden on your mind to think and reply to them. I dismiss my
worries in the faith that God has been protecting you and will

YERAVDA  MANDIR,
December 31, 1930
CHI.,
It is possible that, from an academic standpoint, my
interpretation of the phrase “  is of no value.  But I think
it is possible to interpret it to refer both to the self and the body.  The
self unclouded by ignorance knows neither birth nor death.  However,
one who believes that it dies must believe also that it is born again.
For, nothing in this world suffers total destruction, not even physical
body.  It ceases to exist in one form and takes another.  It goes on
ever changing its form.  After the body has been reduced to ashes it
will not remain unchanged for ever in the form of atoms, for the
atoms will change too. “When turned into ornaments, gold acquires
different names and forms but it, ever remains gold.” Does this
appeal to your reason in any way?  As Vinoba’s style is very lively, he
wins our interest.  However, I have come to the conclusion that it is
possible to put more than one interpretation on the words of the Gita
and that all of them may be right.  The central meaning would remain
the same, and consistent with it there may be as many interpretations
as one may wish, which together, like the numerous instruments in an
orchestra, produce a beautiful symphony. As regards “is seated,”
“sits” and “walks,” it is possible to draw out three distinct meaning.
But the Gita is not a technical or scientific work composed with such
precision.  It abounds in repetitions, and there is looseness of
expression too.  This is not a defect, but it is there.
These days I have been spinning on the takli at least 100 rounds
a day.  I have given up the iron takli, after having tried very hard to
spin well on it, and now I am back to the bamboo takli.  I feel a little
better with it.  The speed has risen to 75 per hour.  It will go up still.
After I have mastered the bamboo takli fully, I will return to the iron
one.

[December 1930 ]1
CHI.  BHAGWANJI,
You have construed the answers to your  questions all right.
Even then I will add a little here.
There is no end to conflicts of loyalties and to miseries.  True
desire for knowledge arises from this.
The body can be said to be an abode of punya2 in spite of its
origin in papa3 in so far as it is a means to realization of the atman.
Knowledge means the realization of the self.  One who has fully
realized truth and non-violence is a perfect jnani in spite of being
unlettered.  This includes the answer to the question why we should
obtain, etc.
Non-attachment means absence of attachment.  Attachment
means the desire for a certain fruit.  Attachment is implicit in wanting
to climb the Himalayas. Climbing the Himalayas when it falls to one’s
lot is doing it free of attachment.
Yoga : Action performed without attachment.  You write books
but you do not crave for honour on that account, nor money nor
praise from anyone.  And since it has been your lot to render service
through writing what you do is yoga.
Generally I do not forbid asking questions.  But the better and
correct way is to solve such problems by oneself and to consult others
in case of doubt.  Unless we did it our discrimination will not develop.

There will be no end to my troubles if you girls or other people
start thinking that I have forgotten those to whom do not write.  Can
anyone write to each member of such a large family?  But you all can
certainly write.
Your handwriting is good, and the sketch of a flower-pot with
flowers standing upright is so good that the flowers seem to emit
fragrance.  Are you doing everything carefully?  Is Dharma3 still
naughty?

January 1, 1931
BHAISHRI  MANMOHANDAS,
I got the pages of your booklet. I have gone through them.
You have collected some useful statistics. But the title of the booklet is
certainly not appropriate. It gives more and more reliable information
about mill-cloth than about handloom cloth.  After reading it,  I felt
that its title “How to Compete with Foreign Cloth” was too ambitious
for the contents. You have not attempted a careful and detailed
examination of hand-spinning.  If you have realized that the master-
key for the solution of the problem is hand-spinning, you should put
1 In the source ‘1’ appears to have been corrected to ‘7’, presumably the date
on which the letter was posted.
2 Vide “Letter to Kashinath Trivedi”. 29-12-1930.VOL 50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 453the truth in your own manner.  If you are not convinced that it is so,
you should not give it a place in your scheme yielding to the present
atmosphere.  I am becoming more and more convinced that, without
hand-spinning, permanent boycott of foreign cloth will be impossible
and that even hand-weaving cannot survive without it.  If you share
this view, you should explain it convincingly.
Despite my partiality for hand-spinning, I don’t think that
Talchekar’s contention is supported by facts. I have even had
correspondence with him on the matter.  His claim that handspun yarn
is superior is not borne out by experience.  By carefully co-ordinating
a variety of factors, it may be possible to produce hand-spun yarn
which would be stronger than mill-yarn, but the ordinary hand-spun
yarn will always be weaker than mill-yarn.  But what does it matter?
As compared to hand-made bhakhari , the biscuit  produced in a
factory with the help of dies will always be perfectly round in shape,
smooth and attractive in appearance, and still the former will continue
to be preferred to it.  You have tried to convince the readers that mill-
cloth and handloom cloth can supplement each other. It may be
possible for some time to regulate things in that manner, but not
permanently.  The division of the booklet into sections is not accurate.
Go through it again.  I have nothing more to add.

527.  LETTER  TO  PREMABEHN  KANTAK
January 1, 1931
CHI.  PREMA,
This week’s post, too, seems to have been delayed.  Meanwhile
I have started writing my letters.
When the mind is occupied with nothing else, it starts thinking
about the boys and girls.  Probably the children don’t know why the
23rd of December is the shortest day.  In trying to explain this, you
will automatically explain to them some facts of geography and
astronomy.  Will you not try this? While explaining the reason for the
23rd being the shortest day, speak about the longest day and about
the dates on which the day and the night are equal.  Simultaneously,
you may explain the change of seasons. While doing so tell them what
Christmas means.  In such discussions, both the parties should feel
interested.  This is also true about the indigenous tables and methods454 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIof oral calculation.  These things, too, can be taught to children in an
entertaining way.  From this, I am generally led to think about botany.
I can a complete ignoramus in this field. You, perhaps, know
something of the subject.  If you do not, you can pick up some
general knowledge without much trouble and impart it to children,
and to me through letters.  You can teach as you learn. But you
should not feel this as a burden on your mind.  It will be a boon to the
children and to me if you make some such effort.
I constantly feel that we don’t give to children all that we ought
to.  We should, therefore, give that at any rate which we can without
much trouble to ourselves.  Discuss this matter with Narandas.

MY  DEAR  KRISHNADAS,
Your letter of 16th instant does not acknowledge my letter in   
reply to your previous letter. Did you not receive it?  In it I    
expressed my joy at hearing from you and asked you to tell me about
Guruji, etc.
I have now received the pieces of khadi which, of course, I shall
use with great pleasure and share with Pyarelal if and when he needs
any clothing. Please thank all the co-workers for these beautiful
pieces.1  There need be no apology for coarseness or unevenness.
Beauty lies in the gentleness and evenness of the heart behind the
work.  I am using only coarse and  uneven khadi, and by reason of
this habit, thin and glossy stuff will feel probably unpleasant.
Do write to me all about you.  How are your parents?  Where is
Guruji now?  Do you ever go to see Hemprabha Devi?  If not, do go
now.  How are you keeping?  Tell me also all about Panditji.  We are
both keeping fit and well.
Love.

January 2, 1931
DEAR ANAND,
I am glad you got all my letters. The problem you present is
incredibly simple. With all your faults and limitations, you should
unreservedly offer your and Vidya’s services to Father whenever he
can accept them. only you must not interpose yourself between Father
and Mother. If he wishes to retire for a while or longer you need not
grieve. It is a natural and proper thing. It would be better ifhe took
some social or humanitarian service. There need be no question of his
approaching you or you him. Let him know that you are his for ever.
The rest will be easy.
As for your distraction the greater your faith in God and your
losing yourself in your task, the greater will be the inner peace.
Love to you both.

530. LETTER  TO  SHIVABHAI  PATEL
YERAVDA  MANDIR,
January 2, 1931
CHI.  SHIVABHAI,
I have your letter.  I had also got your letter describing your
difficulties at Pij, and replied to it.  I hope you received my   reply.
You have done well in confessing everything.  In my opinion,  
you should certainly not have physical relations with your wife. You
should make some arrangement for her education so that her intellect
may develop.  If you are firm in your decision to have no physical
relations with her, you should plainly tell her about that so that she
may not remain discontented and may not go on hoping.  You should
also let her marry again if she wishes to do so.  You should not do that
if deep in your heart you crave for physical gratification.  In any case,
you should make it clear to her that you cannot satisfy her as long as
the present movement lasts.  Since she is poor, you should bear the
burden of maintaining her.  You should ask her to go and live in the
Ashram. The remedy against attacks of lustful thoughts is to devote456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIoneself to work.  How can a person who is always absorbed in work
ever  get time for such thoughts?

You certainly are careless in writing to me.  I should be happy if
you change.  Why do not all of you who are there immediately give
water to Dheds and Bhangis?  And you can also plead with the people
who give their left-overs to the latter to eat.  Do you tell Gangabehn
about all this?  I don’t mind your growing fat, but you should take
care to make your body firm and as strong as steel.  The only way to
do this is hard physical work.

I understand your enthusiasm.  But the Gita tells us that, even if
paradharma  looks more attractive,  swadharma  is better for us.1   We
may die while doing swadharma .  Somebody else’s work is fraught
with danger. Swadharma  means one’s  own work.  Your work is what
Mithubehn  may assign to you. You and others who support you
should reason with Mithubehn.  Till she is won over, you should  keep
patience. You yourself say that you get something to learn every day.
Why then should you be impatient? In any case, a prisoner has no
right to say what work she will do and what work she will not do. My

533.  LETTER  TO  MIRABEHN
January 3, 1931
CHI.  MIRA,
I have read the two  renderings you have sent me of the first
verse of the morning prayer.  For use and perhaps conveying the
meaning, I prefer my rendering. If you find any obscurity anywhere,
please tell me.  The second I sent you by the last mail.1  Here is the
third.
“In the early morning I bow to Him who is beyond darkness,
who is like the sun, who is perfect, ancient, called Purushottam (the
best among men) and in whom (through the veil of darkness) we
fancy the whole universe as appearing even as (in darkness) we
imagine a rope to be a snake. ”2
The idea is that the universe is not real in the sense of being
permanent, it is neither a thing to be hankered after nor feared
because it is supposed to be God’s creation.  As a matter of fact, it is a
creation of our imagination even as the snake in the rope is.  The real
universe like the real rope is there.  We perceive either when the veil is
lifted and darkness is gone—compare. “And with the morn, those
angel faces smile which I have loved long since and lost awhile.”  The
three verses go together and I think are Shankar’s composition.  You
do know of Shankar, do you not?  Five more days and I shall have
finished the translation of the preface. My suggestion is that I
continue to send you the verses and the bhajans with such comments
as then occur to me.  You should for your own satisfaction, with the
help of whoever comes your way, translate the weekly notes on the
Gita.  The plan I am now following is well thought out, i.e., that of
looking through the translation of the whole Gita in the light of my
rendering and translating the notes. The attempt may lead to
1 Vide”Letter to Mirabehn”, 29/30-12-1930
2 Vide Ashram Bhajanavali, 15-12-1930.458 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsomething good of which we have no knowledge today.  If I begin the
translation of the weekly notes, the above plan may fall through
altogether.  It would not be right.  Of my food experiment, you will
learn everything from Narandas. The assurance, that the moment I
find it necessary I shall revart to milk, should remove all cause for
anxiety.
By the travelling wheel I suppose, you mean the box wheel of
the Pratishthan type.  Whatever it is, your speed is certainly quite
good.  Let the Gandiv disappear from your mind unless Kaka has
something to show.  .  .  .1

CHI.  MOTI,
If you wish to continue to be Moti1 of Vijayanagar and not
Motibehn in Vijayanagar, you must learn to make your hand-writing
as beautiful as pearls.  The handwriting in your letter was quite good,
but you should improve it a little every day.  It is one of the virtues of
a person devoted to dharma that he or she is exact in every matter,
small or big.  Will no one in Cochin  agree to keep Shantu exclusively
on fruit?  Write to them and see. One should not be lazy in such
matters.  If pus continues to issue from a child’s gums, we ought not
to remain indifferent.  If we do, the child will not live long.  It is easy
to cure such diseases in childhood.  The alternative is for you to keep
Shantu with you and bring him up yourself.  I am glad that you have
taken up the task of keeping children clean.

540.  LETTER  TO  VASUMATI  PANDIT
YERAVDA  MANDIR,
Sunday Morning, January 4, 1931
CHI.  VASUMATI,
I am writing this immediately after morning prayers.  Taste
ultimately is a matter of the palate and the mind.  Our vow is that we
will not gratify the craving of the palate.  The latter  will always feel
and recognize the taste of every food.  But to gratify the craving of
the palate means to eat food which it likes and avoid food which it
dislikes.  We may certainly eat whatever food the body requires, but
only at the time when and in the quantity which the body requires,
and it does not matter then if it gives us pleasure.  When Mahavir has
conquered the palate, he will gladly accept what is for his good.
Ordinarily, a man does not care for his spiritual good and does what
will give him pleasure for the time being even if that is likely to harm
him spiritually.  Hence the attitude, that one should accept whatever is
offered to one at any time, is not the right one for a spiritual seeker.
We do not know from experience how a person who has attained
perfection acts, and need not concern ourselves with the question. Let
us wait till we have attained perfection. The question then will not arise
at all.  It this does not answer all your question, ask me again.
It is a good sign that we notice even our small defects. We ought
to know whether we are striving  to overcome them.  If I see that I
have pride in me and if I am a spiritual seeker, I am bound to make an
effort to get rid of it.  I shall not feel easy in mind till I have got rid of
it.  If there is a snake in the house, we shall not feel easy in mind till
we have caught and removed it.  If asked, we can certainly say whether462 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwe are trying to remove it. This is also true about snakes and other
such poisonous creatures in our hearts.  I am glad that your ear is now
all right.

cannot escape suffering.  A white beard is bound to have some effect

written to me about you.  He says that you refused to show him your
diary. If this is true, your action was not right. Narandas is an
extremely straightforward man and always does what he thinks right.
You can tell him everything.  Have a quiet talk with him and, if there
has been any misunderstanding, remove it.  If  you wish to live in the
Ashram and are not opposed to any of its rules, Narandas on his part
will certainly take you back.  He has even written to me to say so.
Whether or not you live in the Ashram, you can keep up

relating to your work. Difference of opinion should not mean
personal enmity.
If you think it necessary to engage a lawyer to defend your
brother-in-law, you may do so. If you have sufficient courage,
however, do without  a lawyer.  Your  actions seem all right.  I did not
understand your reason for refusing to sign the summons.  But that is
a minor matter. I have written to Shanta,  Kalavati,  Raghavdas and
Banarsidas.  Read those letters.  You had asked the same, or a similar,
question about art in your previous letter.  I have already replied to it.1
Did you get that letter?  I got the booklet on vows.  I did not see any
letter from Ramnarayan.  There was one from Haribhau2 , and I have
replied to him.  Convey my blessings to all.
Mother should take only so much of milk as leaves her hungry.
If, however, she cannot remain hungry and begs repeatedly for
something to eat, you may give  her a khakhara3.  If she can continue
milk and light diet for some time longer still, she will become all right.
You should do everything with the utmost patience. Don’t feel
unhappy about anything.  “What God, World Teacher and Master has
willed for the day, it is futile to grieve over.  Without His will we
cannot move a blade of grass.  If we do fuss about things, what is left

have to be continued.  I suppose you take sun-baths too. If you have
enough strength,  you should slowly walk about a little.
Now for Mahadev :
I don’t hope at all to leave this place with any new discovery
about the spinning-wheel.  Along with enthusiasm, one must have
knowledge of  the craft, too, which I don’t possess.  I shall be satisfied
if I can make sufficient changes which will enable me to increase my
speed.  I do feel that one can acquire good speed despite one’s age.
If, however, the nerves of my hands have become weak, the speed will
not increase.  But I do make changes from time to time to see if they
help me to increase my speed.  I see that I displayed great wisdom in
not going to England despite Sastri’s view that I should go. Really
speaking, it required no wisdom to come to that decision.  My heart
simply did not consent, however much I tried to persuade myself. The
reins are held by that Master of the Play.  Why, then, need we worry at
all?  On the contrary, we should daily leave the reins more and more
in His hands and strengthen His hands.
If any trace of fissure is noticed, [he] should immediately take
steps to cure it.  And [he] should not give up milk or ghee.  It is our
duty to obtain whatever facilities we can get and which are essential
for our health.  If we clearly see that we hold the body as a trust,  that
it is not our own, we shall think no more about the problem.  It is
good that Devdas has been working at Sanskrit to increase his
proficiency in it.  Mahadev will be able to help him in that.  My
blessings to all prisoners.  Pyarelal spins daily 375 rounds on the
spinning-wheel and 100 on the takli, and the work takes up the whole
of the morning and an hour and a half in the afternoon.

The resolve to devote the rest of your life to service is all to the good.
Derive greater strength from the calamity that has befallen you.2  So
much in the line of service lies before you.  It is gratifying to learn
that the baby is doing well.

I get your letters.  Generally they are quite regular now.  But I
have not been very regular n writing to you  thinking that you will
now be leaving for the Ashram any day.  Of course I think of you
every day.  I don’t at all like your remaining there.  If Jayaprakash
cannot leave just now, and if he wishes, someone from the Ashram will
come to fetch you.  Since Kamala1  has gone to the rest-house, will
you have to go to Prayag now?  I have not received the letter which
Jayaprakash was to write to me.

553.  LETTER  TO  PREMABEHN  KANTAK
January 5, 1931
CHI.  PREMA,
I have your letter.  In my opinion, the view of Vivekananda and
Dhurandhar is one-sided.  One should feel in the heart what one says.
Surdas, Tulsidas and other bhaktas have described themselves  as
cunnings, lustful, etc.  In doing so, they were not merely using theVOL 50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 469language of modesty,  but speaking from the heart.  The truth is that
we feel both ways.  In an enlightened state, we know ourselves to be
Brahman, but in the ignorant state we feel meek and humble  before
that Merciful One.  He who does not feel so but knows himself as the
perfect Brahman may not sing bhajans praying for God’s mercy.
You will not come across one such person in millions. To realize
one’s smallness is the beginning of being great. The drop of sea-water
which  has  become  separated from the sea  would dry up if it
thought that it was still the sea.  If it admitted to itself that it was no
more than a drop, it would flow towards the sea, merge in it and
become one with it.
 “Culture” means refinement of feelings and “education”
means knowledge   of   literature.  Education  is  a  means  and culture
is  the end. The latter is possible even without education.  For instance,
if a child is brought up in a truly cultured family, it will unconsciously
imbibe culture from its environment.  In our country at any rate,
present-day education and culture have no connection  with each
other.  If the educated still retain some culture, that is in spite of their
education.  This fact shows that the roots of our culture are deep.
My blessings and compliments to Prasannabehn.  I should like
her to draw her husband also to the Ashram.
You seem to be running a competition in the opposite direction
with Narandas with regard to weight.  It is good. You can afford to put
on some more weight, and Narandas to lose some.
I like the translation of Gitabodh  which Dhurandhar is making.

APPENDIX I
VICEROY'S LETTER TO SIR T. B. SAPRU1
VICEREGAL LODGE,
SIMLA,
August 28, 1930
DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR,
I have to thank you for informing me of the results of the conversations held
by Mr. Jayakar and yourself with the Congress leaders now in prison and for sending
me copies of their joint letter of the 15th August and of your reply thereto. I should
wish you and Mr. Jayakar both to know how great has been my appreciation of the
spirit in which you have pursued your self-imposed public-spirited task of
endeavouring to assist in the restoration of normal conditions in India. It is worth
recalling the conditions under which you entered upon your undertaking. In my letter
of 16th July I assured you that it was the earnest desire of myself, my Government and
I had no doubt also of His Majesty's Government, to do everything we could to assist
the people of India to obtain as large degree of management of their own affairs as
could be shown to be consistent with the making of provision for those matters in
regard to which they were not at present in a position to assumeresponsibility. It
would be among the functions of the Conference to examine in the light of all the
material available what those matters might be and what provision might be made for
them. I had previously made two other points plain in my speech to the Legislature
on the 9th July. The first is that those attending the Conference would have the
unfettered right of examining the whole constitutional problem in all its bearing.
Secondly, that any agreement at which the Conference was able to arrive would form
the basis of the proposals which His Majesty's Government would later submit to
Parliament. I fear as you will no doubt recognize that the task you had voluntarily
undertaken has not been assisted by the letter you have received from the Congress
leaders. In view both of the general tone by which that letter is inspired and of its
contents, as also of its blank refusal to recognize the grave injury to which the
country has been subjected by the Congress policy, not the least in the economic
field, I do not think any useful purpose would be served by my attempting to deal in
detail with the suggestions there made and I must frankly say I regard discussion on
the basis of the proposals contained in the letter as impossible. I hope if you desire
to see the Congress leaders again you will make this plain.
There is one further comment I must make upon the last paragraph of your
reply to them dated 16th August. When we discussed these matters, I said if the Civil
1 Vide “Statement to T. B. Sapru and M. R. Jayakar”, 5-9-1930VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 471Disobedience Movement was in fact abandoned, I should not desire to continue the
Ordinances (apart from those connected with the Lahore Conspiracy Case and
Chittagong) necessitated by the situation which E X-HYPOTHESI would no longer exist.
But I was careful to make it plain that I was unable to give any assurance, if and when
the Civil Disobedience Movement ceases, that local Governments would find it
possible to release all persons convicted or under trial for offences in connection
with the movement not involving violence, and that while I should wish to see a
generous policy pursued in the matter, the utmost that I could promise would be to
[ask] all the local Governments to consider with sympathy all the cases individually
on their merits.
Upon the point of your reference to the representation of the Congress at the
Conference in the event of their abandoning the Civil Disobedience Movement and
desiring to attend, my recollection is you explained that the demand of the Congress
was not for predominant, in the sense of majority, representation at the Conference
and that I expressed the view that I should anticipate little difficulty in recommending
to His Majesty's Government to secure that the Congress should be adequately
represented. I added that if events so developed, I should be ready to receive a panel of
names from the leaders of the Congress Party of those whom they would regard as
suitable representatives. I feel that you and Mr. Jayakar would desire to be clearly
informed of the position of myself and my Government as it may be desirable that the
letters should be published at an early date in order that the public may be
fullyinformed of the circumstances,in which your efforts have failed to produce the
result you hoped and they so certain]y deserved.
Yours sincerely,
IRWIN

APPENDIX II
NOTES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH VICEROY1
(a) On the constitutional question, the position would be as stated in the four
fundamental points in para 2 of the Viceroy's letter to us of 28th August.
(b) With reference to the question whether Mr. Gandhi would be allowed to
raise at the Round Table Conference the question of India's right to secede from the
Empire at will, the position was as follows: “As the Viceroy has stated in his said
letter to us, the Conference was a free conference. Therefore, anyone could raise any
points he liked, but the Viceroy thought it would be very unwise for Mr. Gandhi to
raise this question now. If, however, he faced the Government of India with such a
question, the Viceroy would say the Government were not prepared to treat it as an
1 Held at Simla with Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and M. R. Jayakar between August
21 and 28. Vide also 1st footnote of “Statement to T. B. Sapru and M. R. Jayakar”,     
5-9-1930472  THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIopen question. If, in spite of this, Mr. Gandhi desired to raise the question, the
Government would inform the Secretary of State of his intention to do so at the Round
Table Conference.”
(c) As regards the right to raise the question at the Round Table Conference of
India's liability to certain financial burdens and to get them examined by an
independent Tribunal, the position was that the Viceroy could not entertain any
proposition amounting to total repudiation of all debts, but it would be open to
anyone to raise, at the Round Table Conference, any question as to any financial
liability of India and to call for its examination.
 (d) As regards the granting of relief against the Salt Act, the position of the
Viceroy was that (1) the Salt Tax was going to be provincialized if the
recommendation of the Simon Commission in that behalf was accepted, and (2) there
has been already great loss of revenue and therefore the Government would not like to
forgo this source, but if the Legislature was persuaded to repeal the Salt Act and if any
proposal was put forward to make good the loss of revenue occasioned by such repeal,
the Viceroy and his Government would consider the question on its merits. It was not,
however, possible for the Viceroy to condone  open breaches of the Salt Act so long
as it was law. When goodwill and peace  were restored and, if Indian leaders desired to
discuss with H. E. the  Viceroy and  his Government  how best economic  relief couldbe
given to the poorer classes on his behalf, the Viceroy would be glad to call a small
conference of Indian leaders.
(e) With reference to picketing, the position was that if picketing amounted to
nuisance to any class of people or was coupled with molestation or intimidation or
the use of force, the Viceroy reserved to the Government the right of taking such
action as the law allowed or taking of such legal powers as might be necessary to
meet any emergency that might arise. Subject to the above when peace was
established the Ordinance against picketing would be withdrawn.
(f) With regard to the re-employment of the officers who resigned or had been
dismissed during the Civil Disobedience campaign, the position was that this matter
was primarily a question for the discretion of local Governments. Subject however to
there being vacancies and as long as it did not involve dismissing men who had
proved loyal, the local Government would be expected to re-employ men who had
thrown up their appointments in a fit of excitement or who had been swept off their
feet.
(g) As for the restoration of printing presses confiscated under the Press
Ordinance, there would be no difficulty.
(h) As regards the restoration of fines and properties confiscated under the
Revenue Law, that required closer definition. As to the properties confiscated or soldVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 473under such law, there might be the rights of third parties involved. As to refunding
fines, there were difficulties. In short, all that the Viceroy could say was that the local
Government would exercise their discretion with justice and take all the circumstances
into consideration and try to be as accommodating as they could.
(i) As to the release of prisoners, the Viceroy had already explained his views
in his letter to us dated July 28th.

APPENDIX III
NOTE FROM NEHRUS1
NAINI CENTRAL PRISON,
August 31, 1930
We have had further interviews with Mr. M. R. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur
Sapru yesterday and today, and have had the advantage of long talks with them. They
have given us a copy of the letter, dated August 23, addressed to them by His
Excellency Lord Irwin. In this letter, it is stated clearly that Lord Irwin regards
discussion on the basis of the proposals contained in our joint letter of August 15 to
Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and  Mr. Jayakar as  impossible, andunder the circumstances, he
rightly concludes their efforts have failed to produce any result. This joint letter, as
you know, was written after a full consideration by the signatories to it, and
represented the utmost they were prepared to go in their individual capacities. We
stated there that no solution would be satisfactory unless it fulfilled certain vital
conditions, and that a satisfactory declaration to that effect was made by the British
Government. If such a declaration was made, we would be prepared to recommend to
the Working Committee the advisability of calling off Civil Disobedience, provided
simultaneously certain steps indicated in our letter were taken by the British
Government in India.
It was only after a satisfactory settlement of all these preliminaries, that the
question of the composition of the proposed London Conference and of the Congress
being represented at it could be decided. Lord Irwin, in his letter, considers even a
discussion on the basis of these proposals as impossible. Under the circumstances,
there is or can be no common ground between us. Quite apart from the contents, the
tone of the letter and the recent activities of the British Government in India clearly
indicate that the Government has no desire for peace. The proclamation of the
Working Committee as an illegal body in the Delhi Province soon after a meeting of
it was announced to be held there, and the subsequent arrest of most of its members
can have that meaning and no other. We have no complaint against these or other
arrests or other activities of the Government, 'uncivilized' and 'barbarous' as we
1 Vide 1st footnote of “Statement to T. B. Sapru and M. R. Jayakar”, 5-9-1930474  THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIconsider some of these to be. We welcome them. But, we feel, we are justified in
pointing out that a desire for peace and an aggressive attack on the very body, which
is capable of giving peace and with which it is sought to treat, do not go well
together. The proscription of the Working Committee all over India and the attempt
to prevent its meetings must necessarily mean that the national struggle must go on,
whatever the consequences, and that there will be no possibility of peace, for those
who may have some authority to represent the people of India will be spread out in
British prisons all over India.
Lord Irwin's letter and the action taken by the British Government make it
plain that the efforts of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar have been in vain.
Indeed, the letter and some of the explanations that had been given to us take us back,
in some respects, even from the position that was previously taken. In view of the
great HIATUS that exists between our position and Lord Irwin's, it is hardly necessary
to go into details, but we should like to point out to you certain aspects of his letter.
The first part of the letter is practically a repetition of his speech to the Legislative
Assembly and of the phrases used in his letter dated July 16, addressed to Mr. Jayakar
and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. As we pointed out in our joint letter, this phraseology is
too vague for us to assess its value. It may be made to mean anything or nothing. In
our joint letter, we have made it clear that a complete National Government
responsible to the people of India, including control over the DefenceForces and
economic control, must be recognized as India's immediate demand. There is no
question of what are usually called safeguards or any delay. Adjustments there
necessarily  must be for the transference of power and in regard to these we stated that
they were to be  determined by India's chosen representatives.
As regards India's right of secession at will from the British Empire and her
right to  refer British claims and concessions to an independent tribunal all that we
are told is that  the Conference will be a free conference and any point can be raised
there. This is no  advance on the previous statement made. We are further told,
however, that if the British  Government in India were definitely faced with the
possibility of the former question being  raised, Lord Irwin would say they were not to
treat it as an open question. All they could  do was to inform the Secretary of State of
our intention to raise the question at the  Conference.
As regards the other proposition, we are told that Lord Irwin could only
entertain  the idea of a few individual financial transactions being subjected for
scrutiny. While such  scrutiny may take place in individual cases, its scope will have
to extend to the whole field  of British claims including, as we have stated, the
so-called Public Debt of India. We  consider both these questions as of vital
importance and previous agreement in our joint  letter seems to us essential.
Lord Irwin's reference to the release of prisoners is very restricted and
unsatisfactory. He is unable to give an assurance that all of the non-violent civil
disobedience prisoners even will be discharged. All he proposes to do is to leave the
matter  in the hands of the Local Governments. We are not prepared to trust in such aVOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 - 5 JANUARY, 1931 475matter to  the generosity or sympathy of Local Governments or local officials but,
apart from this,  there is no reference in Lord Irwin's letter to other non-violent
prisoners. There are a  large number of Congressmen and others who were sent to
prison for political offences  prior to the Civil Disobedience Movement. We might
mention in this connection the  Meerut Case prisoners who have already spent a year
and a half as under-trials. We have  made it clear in our joint letter that all these
persons should be released.
Regarding the Bengal and the Lahore Case Ordinances we feel no exception
should  be made in their favour as suggested by Lord Irwin. We have not claimed
release for those  political prisoners who may have been guilty of violence not
because we would not  welcome their release but because we felt that as our movement
was strictly non-violent,  we would not confuse the issue. But, the least we can do is
to press for ordinary trial for  these fellow-countrymen of ours and not by an
extraordinary court constituted by an  Ordinance which denies them the right of
appeal and the ordinary privilege of accused.
Amazing events including the brutal assaults that have occurred even in open
court  during the so-called trial make it imperative that the ordinary procedureshould
be followed. We understand that some of the accused in protest against the treatment
accorded to them have been on hunger-strike for a long period and are now at death's
door. The Bengal Ordinance, we understand, has been replaced by an Act of the Bengal
Council. We consider this Ordinance and any Act passed on it most objectionable,
and the fact that an unrepresentative body like the present Bengal Council has passed
it does not make it any the better.
As regards the further picketing of foreign cloth and liquor shops, we are told,
Lord Irwin is agreeable to the withdrawal of the Picketing Ordinance, but he states
that if he thinks it necessary, he will take fresh legal powers to combat picketing.
Thus, he informs us that he might re-enact the Ordinance or do something in Simla to
it whenever he considers it necessary. The reply regarding the Salt Act and certain
other matters referred to in our joint letter is also wholly unsatisfactory. We need not
deal with it at any length here as you are an acknowledged expert on salt. We would
only say we see no reason to modify our previous position as regards these matters.
Thus Lord Irwin has declined to agree to all the major propositions and many
of the minor ones laid down in our joint letter. The difference in his outlook and ours
is very great, indeed fundamental. We hope you will show this note to Mrs. Sarojini
Naidu, Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel, Mr. Jairamdas Doulatram and in consultation with them
give your reply to Mr. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. We feel that the publication
of the correspondence must no longer be delayed, and we are not justified in keeping476  THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthe public in the dark. Even apart from the question of publication, we are requesting
Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar to send copies of all correspondence and
relevant papers to Chaudhri Khaliq Usman, the Acting President of the Indian
National Congress. We feel we ought to take no steps without immediate information
being sent to the Working Committee, which happens to be functioning.

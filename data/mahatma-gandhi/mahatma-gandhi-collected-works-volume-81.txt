2. LETTER TO AMRIT KAUR
August 18, 1941
MY DEAR IDIOT,
This thing about the post is vexing. But what is one to do with a
village P[ost] O[ffice]?
The second vexing thing is your indifferent condition. Why
should you not feel first class? Could it have anything to do with
your having taxed yourself too much over Jamnalal? He is in
rapturesover the kindness shown to him by you all— meaning you and
your. . .1 The thought has just occurred to me and I have passed it on to
you. Anyway it is time you got well.
We had a glorious day here. We had prayers at which Gurudev’s
songs were sung, the morning “ Jivana jakhan2” by Sushila and the
“Anand lok[e]3” in the evening by Prabhakar who is proving a fine
singer. We had a pice collection from every adult and more from those
who could pay more. The Ashramites not having any money of their
own spun for one hour and got one pice for their labour at market
price. Maganlal gave Rs. 2,500, Janakibehn Rs. 110, Sushila Rs. 500 in
10 instalments, i.e., Rs. 50 out of her salary. Therefore, we have a
goodly sum in Sevagram. Ashadevi went out for collection and prayer
in Wardha. I have not yet had the report. But it was good there too.
Vallabhbhai’s condition is bad. You must have seen the report.
Let us see what happens. It is a big load on the mind.
Mridula leaves today for Bombay. She has come to solve her little
difficulties.

CHI. SUSHILA,
You were to leave one of your pens here. I do not find it here. If
it is with you, it is all right. I do not want a new pen.
There is a postcard from Nagpur today addressed to you. It is a
reply to your letter : ‘‘The prisoner is not legally allowed to meet
anyone. And he does not wish to meet anyone in particular.’’ So even
if the telephone had been answered, you would have got the same reply.
I hope you did not have much trouble and could catch the train
easily. If you remember, write to me how many minutes before time
you reached.
Do not fix appointments anywhere. I do not wish to place any
burden on you. It would hurt me taking even a moment from your
studies.

August 19, 1941
DEAR DR. TARACHAND,
Many thanks for your cheque which I am passing to the
Deenabandhu Memorial Fund. If you do not like the disposal I can
easily alter it.
I have purposely not moved in the Hindi matter because of the
extraordinary riots in Dacca and elsewhere. The matter has to be settled
but the values have changed. As I read the signs of the times the matter
does not admit of piecemeal treatment. I drafted my statement.
Sunderlalji did not like it much. Meanwhile the disturbances affected
me deeply and I stayed immediate action, my views remaining the same.
Yours sincerely,

BHAI INDRAVADAN,
Searching for the envelope sent by you would take some time,
and, moreover, you have no reason to complain since you are getting
one pice worth more than what you spent. If we exclusively look after
the cow, the buffalo will not perish, but if we exclusively look after the
latter both the cow and the buffalo will perish. If we try to look after
both, then also both would perish. All the world over people use mostly
cow’s milk. From the medical point of view, too, cow’s milk is more
beneficial.

SEVAGRAM , via WARDHA,
August 20, 1941
CHI. DEVDAS,
I read your letter addressed to Mahadev. He has been held up in
Bombay.
I think you should not have published a report like that without
verifying it. And even if you published it, to have made unfounded
comments on it was certainly wrong. [I]1 cannot save you. And,
moreover, you have given the name of the Chief Justice. I am afraid you
will be found guilty. You had better consult a lawyer and publish,
before attending the court, an apology saying that your correspondent
was unable to prove the truth of his report. I think this would be a
graceful step. Or you may apologize in the court without defending
yourself. I am suggesting this from the moral and legal point of view.
But ultimately do as Sir Tej Bahadur and Munshi advise. I am sending a
copy of this letter, together with your letter, to Mahadev. You have
signed in full, but I can decipher neither “Devdas” nor “Gandhi”. The
civilized rule is that the letters even in a signature should be as neat as
pearls.

Neither of them had to be given quinine. Just for trial I had given to
Maganlal betel and calotropis leaf. I cannot say whether these helped or
the fever went down on its own. Appa is doing well. He had been put on
vegetable soup and fruit juice. He was also given a little butter. From
today he is being given roti. He is feeling better. He does not seem to
have any complaint about his throat either. Annapurna gets temperature
up to 99°. Sankaran says that he has swelling of the throat. He will apply10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsomething. I am feeling much improved after reducing the food quota

initial improvement. This is my third attempt after your insistence on
my increasing the intake of milk, etc. I have also reduced walking. The
work is stopped by 8.30 p.m. It is possible to stop talking altogether
about important matters while walking. In the evening I keep my eyes
closed both when going out and returning. That does not interfere with

27. FOREWORD TO “A DISCIPLINE FOR NON-VIOLENCE ”1
SEVAGRAM ,
August 24, 1941
A Discipline for Non-violence  is a pamphlet written by Mr.
Richard B. Gregg for the guidance of those Westerners who endeavour
to follow the law of satyagraha. I use the word advisedly instead of
‘pacifism’. For what passes under the name of pacifism is not the same
as satyagraha. Mr. Gregg is a most diligent and methodical worker. He
[has] had first-hand knowledge of satyagraha, having lived in India and
that too for nearly a year in the Sabarmati Ashram. His pamphlet is
1 To its first Indian edition published by Navajivan Publishing House,
Ahmedabad14 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIseasonable and cannot fail to help the satyagrahis of India. For though
the pamphlet is written in a manner attractive for the West, the substance
is the same for both the Western and the Eastern satyagrahi. A cheap
edition of the pamphlet is therefore being printed locally for the benefit
of Indian readers in the hope that many will make use of it and profit
by it. A special responsibility rests upon the shoulders of Indian
satyagrahis, for Mr. Gregg has based the pamphlet on his observation of
the working of satyagraha in India. However admirable this guide of
Mr. Gregg’smay appear as a well-arranged code, it must fail in its
purpose if the Indian experiment fails.

28. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDRA,
August 24, 1941
Being vitally connected with immigration problems and having
been in South Africa for twenty years, I am naturally interested in the
Indo-Burma Immigration Agreement. It has caused me deep pain. I
have collected as much literature as I could on the subject. I have
studied as much of it as was necessary to enable me to form anopinion
and as was possible during the very limited time at my disposal.
My study has led me to the conclusion that it is an unhappy
agreement.
It is panicky and penal. In the papers I find no reason to warrant
any panic nor do I find any warrant for the severe punishment meted
out to the Indians resident in Burma.
The burden of proving the right to remain in Burma has in every
case been thrown on the Indian resident. One would have thought that
the least that should have been done was to have automatically
recognized as fully domiciled every Indian found in Burma on the date
of promulgation of the Agreement.
I am acquainted with the immigration laws of South Africa and
other countries. In every case the restrictions have been imposed by
legislation and, after fairly full opportunity being given for the
expression of public opinion, legislation has been preceded by
considerable lapse of time for the ventilation of views on the mere
proposal for legislation.
In this case secrecy and mystery have surrounded the Agreement
which has been sprung upon an unsuspecting public.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 15The whole thing appears still more hideous when we recall the fact
that only a few years ago Burma was an integral part of India.
Does the partition make India a leper country the presence
of whose inhabitants must carry heavy penalties including the tickets of
leave such as criminals carry? They do not cease to be less offensive
because they bear the inoffensive name of passports andpermits. I
should be prepared to understand the validity of the permit and passport
system when the necessity is clearly established. I must refuse to believe
that this Agreement is in response to a vital cry from the great Burmese
nation with which the people of India never had any quarrel and with
which India had enjoyed cultural contact long before the advent of the
foreigner from the West.
We can never be in Burma or the Burmans in India foreigners in
the same sense as people from the West. There has been free commerce
and emigration to Burma for hundreds of years.
This drastic Agreement is an undeserved slur both on India and
Burma.
This Agreement is a brutal reminder that both India and Burma
are under the British heel and that the Government of India Act and the
Government of Burma Act gave no real freedom to the respective
peoples. They give no scope for full growth to us. I fear that this
statement of mine will not please the Premier of Burma who may think
that the Agreement is a popular Act. He will soon discover the error, if
he has not already, that he has not served his people but that he has
played himself into the hands of those who would want to exploit
Burma to the exclusion of any rivals. I must admit that Indians have
been partners with the Westerners in the exploitation of Burma, but with
this fundamental difference, that the Westerner went to Burma with his
gun, while the Indian went on sufferance as he has always done in every
part of the world.
We cannot exist in Burma for one single day without Burmese
goodwill.
I would plead with the Burmese Ministers and the Burmese people
that they should wait for the regulation of immigration till both of us
are free and independent for such regulation. I flatter myself with the
belief that when that happy day arrives, as it must, such matters will
regulate themselves, for we shall never want to impose our nationals on
one another.
But I have strayed. My purpose just now is to show that this
Agreement must be undone inasmuch as it breaks every canon of16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIinternational propriety. It becomes less defensible in that an Indian1
instead of an Englishman was sent to negotiate the Agreement. It is an
old and familiar trick, that of putting up an Indian to perform a
disagreeable task. Nor is it relevant that the Agreement had the
approvalof local Indian opinion. For the Agreement is an insult to the
whole nation, not merely to the particular individuals whose material
interests lie in Burma. But even if it was relevant, there should be
evidence to show the volume and character of that opinion.
When I come to examine the Baxter Report2, which became the prelude
to the Agreement, it contains nothing to justify the Agreement. This was
the reference made to Mr. Baxter:
The enquiry will be directed to ascertaining:
1. the volume of Indian immigration;
2. to what extent it is seasonal and temporary and to what extent permanent;
3. in what occupations Indians are mainly employed and the extent to which
they are unemployed or underemployed;
4. whether in such employment Indians either have displaced Burmans or
could be replaced by Burmans, due regard being paid to both the previous
history of such occupations and their economic requirements; and
5. whether in the light of the statistics obtained and other relevant factors
any system of equating the supply of Indian unskilled labour to Burmans’
requirements is needed.
Thus it was purely a fact-finding commission. Here is the fact
found by the Commission:
There is no evidence of any kind to suggest that Indians have
displaced Burmans from employment which they had previously obtained.
. . . Indian labour in the past has been supplementary rather than alternative to
Burmese labour.
That surely does not justify the restrictions imposed by the
Agreement on the movement of Indians in Burma. The
recommendations made in the Report appear to me to be in excess of
the reference and therefore of no effect. Add to this the fact that the
opinion of the assessors finds no mention in the Report. It may not have
weighed with the Commissioner but surely it should have found
mention in the Report.
1 Girija Shankar Bajpai; vide “Letter to Amrit Kaur”, 27-7-1941
2 James Baxter, Financial Adviser, with two assessors, U Tin-Tut and Ratilal
Desai, was appointed by the Government of Burma to examine the question of Indian
immigration into Burma. The report was submitted to the Government of Burma in
October 1940.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 17Now let me for a moment examine the pertinent sections of the
Act. Here they are:
Section 44(3) of the Government of Burma Act, 1935, says:
The provisions of Sub-section (2) of this Section shall apply in relation to
British subjects domiciled in India and subjects of any Indian State as they apply
in relation to British subjects domiciled in the United Kingdom, but with the
substitution in the provision to the said Sub-section for references to the United
Kingdom or references to British India, or as the case may be, that Indian State:
Provided that nothing in this Sub-section shall affect any restriction
lawfully imposed on the right of entry into Burma of persons who are British
subjects domiciled in India or subjects of any Indian State, or any restriction
lawfully imposed as a condition of allowing any such persons to enter Burma.
Section 138 of the same Act:
His Majesty may by Order-in-Council direct that, during such period as may
be specified in the Order, immigration into Burma from India shall be subject to
such restrictions as may be specified in the Order (being such restrictions as may
have been mutually agreed before the commencement of this Act between the
Governor of Burma-in-Council and the Governor-General of India-in-Council and
approved by the Secretary of State, or in default of agreement as may have been
prescribed by the Secretary of State), and no other restrictions:
Provided that any such Order may be varied by a subsequent Order-in-Council
in such manner as appears to His Majesty necessary to give effect to any
agreement in that behalf made after the commencement of this Act by the
Governor with the Governor-General of India or the Governor-General of
India-in-Council.
The first read as a whole does not appear to contemplate any
interference with the present Indian population. The second is decisive.
According to this Section restriction by agreement cannot be
imposed on the present Indian settlers.
I have no doubt whatsoever that the Secretary of State for India
should not pass the Order-in-Council and should withhold his assent to
the Agreement. Any restriction should be a matter for legislation by the
Burmese Assembly in consultation with and with the co-operation of the
Government of India.
It is pertinent to the examination of the Agreement to know what
declarations were made by His Majesty’s Ministers when the Act was
passed. Here is the assurance of Sir Thomas Inskip, the then Minister for
Co-ordination and Defence, on the subject:
Nobody wants to discriminate between British subjects domiciled in India18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIor Indian States’ subjects when they go to Burma, any more than one wants to
discriminate between the British when they go to British India.
Mr. Butler (then Under-Secretary of State for India) also stated in
the House of Commons:
In connection with unskilled Indian labour, the Governor of Burma is asked
to confer with the Governor-General with a view to ,regulating the immigration
of unskilled labour into Burma. The reason we cannot make a simple rule is that
we have to make this differentiation in regard to unskilled labour, while at the
same time we do not want to stop the free entry of Indians in general.
Such declarations may have no validity in the interpretation of the
Act in a court of law. But politically considered they have or should
have the effect of promissory notes.
The Agreement is a clear breach of the declarations quoted by
me. I am glad that responsible Indian public opinion is being expressed
in unmistakable terms in condemnation of the Agreement.

I got your letter written from Junagadh. If you had any
imagination you would have given a description of the town, what you
saw there, what you learnt, and so on. Does not Nanabhai ask you
whether you lost in Sevagram all the intelligence you had cultivated?
My health is fine, as also Ba’s. Did I write to you that Prabhavati and
Kusum are here at present? Rajkumari is still in Simla and as she is
having fever and cough she is not coming here in the immediate future.

CHI. DEVDAS,
I got your letter. You have argued well. Yes, one must take risks.
But the point is that even in doing so one must exercise discretion and
restraint. Even the additional information you have given does not
justify your involving the Chief Justice. You were free to agitate the
matter strongly without doing that. You could have taken that magistrate
to task for describing it as “voluntary”. And you could have written at
length about what the man from the Punjab did. I would endorse your
going to the utmost length in taking risks. But here I find your case
weak. However, if the lawyers permit you, you may follow their advice. I
certainly do not wish to dampen your enthusiasm.
Mahadev also will write to you from Bombay.

CHI. JAMNALAL,
I have replied to your wire, and have now received a reply to that,
too. The worry about Mahesh is not over. The disease which goes back
to many years is not active, but it cannot be said to have been
completely cured. He is on a special diet, etc. Perhaps he will feel tired
soon. In this condition he should not be asked to go out unless there is
urgent work. Do you need any help? If so, of what sort?
I see no point in sending Shanta1 there. If it is for her good, she
can be sent independently after you have had sufficient experience
there. If you want her services, I think you will derive the full benefit
from your stay there only if you check your desire. This is mypersonal
view. But I will carry out your wishes. I have still not asked Shanta.
Vallabhbhai has been released. He is not suffering from polypus,
and, therefore, there is no cause for anxiety.

I do know, of course, that the happiness and security to be found
in living together are not to be found in staying alone. That is why it is
said that even the overcrowding of the dear ones is to be welcomed. For
Anand’s diarrhoea, add one teaspoonful of lime-water or dill-water or
the two together to the milk. You can make lime-water even at home. If
you add water to pieces of limestone, there will be effervescence and
you will get clean, sky-blue water at the top. Decant and store it in a
bottle. Add a teaspoonful from this to the milk. Boil one teaspoonful of
dill seeds in eight ounces of water, strain the water and add one
teaspoonful from this to the milk. Thus mix lime water and dill-water
with the milk by turns. He is bound to benefit. Do not give him any rotli
for a day or two.

Nothing from you today. So you see the irregularity is not

there is not greater irregularity or that there is postal service at all. Fifty

Porbunder we had to send special messengers. So I am satisfied when I

The description of your work is very attractive. The results of
work which has no selfishness are always good. Do not take any notice
of those who are opposing it, but feel pity for them and whenever you
get a chance to serve, do whatever you can to help them, e.g., if they are
sick, try to make them well. This is the one way to conquer hatred by
love and anger by patience. We should always reply to unkind words by
keeping silent.

wish, and that is as it should be. The question, therefore, is what is for
her good. If you are going to stay there for a sufficiently long time, she
may perhaps benefit a little by going there. I think she should stay there
when you are not there. It may not even be necessary for her to stay
there. She does have the spirit of devotion in her. What we have to
consider is whether or no the atmosphere there will make her work. In
this life she will not look upon anybody else as her guru. You are her
guru and, therefore, you have but to command her. Your stay there will
be over by the time this correspondence comes to an end. If you are
getting complete peace of mind there and also getting all other facilities
which you need, do not leave the place. If you decide to stay on, or even
if you don’t, send a wire if you want Shanta there. I will send her
immediately. I have exchanged wires with you merely because your
wire left scope for further thinking. It was necessary to think about both
Mahesh and Shanta. I have understood that you are sending for both
for their own sakes and not because you want their services. If your
motive is to get their services, we will have to think in a different way.

Amritlal has told me nothing. Is there any man who never
‘bungles’? What else is Churchill doing? And what am I doing? I still
remember that Deshbandhu Das had flung at me this very word. We
should rectify our mistake as soon as we discover it, and go ahead. If we
again commit a mistake we should set it right again. And, moreover,
Raihana is with you now and she will cheer you up. Yes, one thing is

up  with Varoda.  I had  always  had t he fear that  she would not  be
able to  stay in Varoda. She needs company.  She is scared at night.
She asked for a male companion.  I sent somebody to sleep there. Her
fever shot up at night and she was scared. If her fever continues to rise
1 Akhil Bharatiya Hindi Sahitya Sammelan26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIlike this, I cannot look after her unless I bring her here. She too cannot
stay there.
Now Dr. Das is asking for her case history. Hence, you should put
down in English whatever you know of it and send it to me. She is my
responsibility till you can take charge of her. I shall get Dr. Das to help,
but finally what I wish will be done. Tari is a difficult patient. I cannot
say if she will allow my decision to be carried out. This matter is
strangely complicated. You should not be burdened with it for the
present. I shall try to lighten it as much as I can. Right now send me
only her case history. I myself do not have a very clear idea of her
trouble. You mentioned some gland. But where is the gland ? Today she
told the doctor that she felt pain in the lower abdomen when it was
pressed.

can make any marks you like on the papers with you. If you think fit
you may hand them over to Bachhraj Co. Or if you wish they will
deposit them with some lawyer. The Navajivan office will need the
account books every now and then. I will certainly inquire into the
charge you have levelled against them, but I must say that I have not
agreed to inquire into their affairs, nor do I entertain any suspicion
against them. I cannot readily believe that they have all conspired with

over trifles also what you learnt here? Anyway Mahadev has had to
apologize on your behalf.
And it is not proper, either, that you should lose heart about your
studies. There is no slavery there. You are a slave only of your habit and
your anger. You should get over these shortcomings. If
you cannot do that, I can see that it will be difficult for you tocontinue
there. You should regard yourself forbidden to have tea in Irani
restaurants, for is it not the rule that you will get tea only once a day?
Go to Mahadevbhai himself, understand from him what your dharma is
and follow it.

Does your postcard mean that your going there has meant too

all assume that you must stay there. You can even return or go to
Sabarmati or somewhere else. Write to me in detail. Eat some leafy

Taribehn would not listen to anyone. She would listen to you or
your namesake Sushila. And Sushila also listens to you. Hence,
ultimately Tari will be cured only by you. She will not go to Bombay.
She will remain here somehow. You alone should give her the
injections. If you insist, I shall arrange that she takes them now. You are
coming here on the 13th, are you not ? There is information that
Pyarelal will be released on Saturday. Kanu will be going to receive
him. A. S. went for the second time because she had to go to Nagpur.
Otherwise, what you say is correct.
You will be getting along very well.

DEAR PROFULLA,
I am late replying to your letter.
Sardar is free from the danger that was suspected. Of course he is36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIconsiderably reduced and has to be under observation.
Kishorelal is living at the Ashram. He is as well as can be
expected.
Khan Saheb had all his teeth extracted. He was better for the
extraction.
Rajen Babu is still far from well. He is expected here in
September.
Yes, I did hear of the death of Dr. A. Das. I sent a note of
condolence1. He was truly a great and good national servant. Such
tragedies will occur, we have to bear them. There is little malariain the
Ashram. But an indefinite and unclassified fever attacks the inmates now

I hope all of you are keeping well.

Sarvodaya  is for the udaya—rise—of sarva—all. Gurudev also
longed to serve the world through India and breathed his last while38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdoing so. He is gone but his experiment is unfinished. His mortal
remains are no more but his soul is immortal like ours. Taken in this
sense none perishes or dies; none is born. But Gurudev lives on in a
special sense. His activities were universal, mostly altruistic and through
these he will be immortal. Santiniketan, Sriniketan and Visvabharati—all
these are manifestations of one movement. They were his soul and for
them Deenabandhu left this world followed by Gurudev. Our true
homage should be to maintain these institutions which he is watching

I have your letter. Pyarelal has arrived. I gave him your letter to
read. He seems to be in a cheerful mood. We have not talked. Most
probably he will come there and also go to Delhi.
Annapurna’s fever is not going. Manu is giving her the medicine
that was given to Rajkumari. Prabhakar is well. I had thought your
suggestion about the diet was to be continued only up to the 13th, when
you would be arriving. I shall carry on with what I am taking now and
after your arrival on the 13th, shall make whatever changes you suggest.
So far, 2 oz. of butter is having good effect. I am gradually increasing
the milk quota. The bowel movement has considerably improved. The
enclosed cartoons have been brought by Pyarelal. You will like them.

It is simply a coincidence that these essays on “Practical
Non-violence” are being published in pamphlet form almost
simultaneously with Richard Gregg’s A Discipline for Non-violence1.
The votary of non-violence should read the two together. Kishorelal
Mashruwala is like R. Gregg a deep student of non-violence. Though he
has been brought up in that faith, he never takes anything for granted.
He believes only what he has tested. Thus he has come to accept
non-violence by hard thinking. He has in his own life and practice
proved its efficacy in a variety of conditions—political, economic, social
and domestic. His essays have, therefore, a value all their own. They
should help the believer in non-violence in sustaining his faith and the
honest unbeliever in resolving his doubts.
M. K. G ANDHI
SEVAGRAM , August 31, 1941
Practical Non-violence
75. A DIFFICULT PROBLEM
A person who is scientifically inclined does not take the truth of
anything for granted; he tries to prove it himself. In this way he
develops his own intellect and also obtains knowledge of the
potentialities of things. Why does an apple fall off the tree, why does it
not fly up? It is said that this question arose in Newton’s mind and he
discovered the law of gravitation. Is the earth flat like a plate? Is it
stationary? Such questions arose in Galileo’s mind and he discovered
that the earth is spherical like an orange and revolves on its axis. Such
discoveries have produced great results.
A khadi worker should adopt a similar scientific attitude. Newton
or Galileo did not ponder over the problem of Daridran-arayana  and
of serving Daridranarayana . They followed an intellectual quest. The
khadi worker has however to find a solutionto the problem of feeding
the hungry masses. That is why their attitude should be all the more
scientific.
Why khadi? Why not mill cloth? Also, why not foreign cloth?
Why cotton cloth? Why not silk? Why not jute or woollen textiles? Why
the charkha? Why not the takli? I can go on filling pages with questions
1 For Gandhiji’s foreword to this pamphlet,  vide “Forward to “A Discipline For
Non-Violence”, 24-8-1941VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 41like these but I do not propose to exhaust all the possible questions.
I want to touch upon only one question here. Suppose for a
moment that for one reason or the other India does not have or cannot
run textile mills, also suppose that no cloth can be imported from
abroad, can we then provide sufficient khadi to all the Indians? We
should not be satisfied with meeting the demand somehow. The East
India Company did this and to some extent this was done even earlier.
In those days people were forced to spin and to weave on minimum
wages. This custom was called begar. We have to confess with regret that
begar is an ancient custom. It was not introduced by the British. We
may perhaps be able to produce enough khadi through begar. But
khadi workers cannot be trained to undertake such inhuman work. Our
intention is to help the spinners earn such wages as would ensure, after
eight hours’ hard labour, wholesome and nutritious food, necessary
clothing, comfortable houses and other amenities necessary for a happy
home. If it is proved that khadi cannot succeed under these terms and
conditions, we should modestly accept the limitations of khadi and also
restrict our activity.
Let me state my view here. I have adopted khadi in the belief that
khadi has all the above-mentioned capacity. I cannot adduce irrefutable
evidence in support of my view. Many of my activities are undertaken
in good faith or intuitively. But they are not conducted on the basis of
inspiration alone; I have tried to place my convictions on a sound
scientific foundation while propagating them. I have made and am still
making all possible experiments based on reason and I encourage my
co-workers to do so. We have not found a solution to the problem posed
above; we may perhaps never get it and I know it is a difficult problem,
a complex problem. It does involve a lot of statistics as also knowledge
of economics, psychology, particularly of the Indian mind, and also of
ethics. A mere statistical solution will not do, nor will a mere economic
solution, because we cannot ignore our most fundamental and vital
principles. We do not want to spread khadi through coercion. We want
to do our work by changing people’s sense of values and habits. Hence
our researches should proceed from all angles.
Khadi workers should intensify their efforts to solve this difficult
problem.
This is enough for the day.

Unrevised      September 5, 1941
MY DEAR IDIOT,
I write this during the silent hour, i.e., before dinner and before
the post.
I have not heard from Agatha nor from Henry1. But I saw H.’s
article in a magazine which contained the attack. I thought I should
correct him. If you want to see the article I can send it to you. And as I
did not know H.’s address I wrote to Agatha.
Of course you were right in refusing the Hyd. invitation as you
would be in refusing every other. I sent it to you so that you may know
it and send a reply. You were bound to refuse. Before you take up
anything you must be thoroughly restored. Even as it is, you are giving
a good account of yourself.
You remember the pamphlet containing the Lahore resolution2 on
Pakistan! Two copies have been traced in the library.
I never anticipate evil. So the answer to your question stands
deferred till the .evil overtakes us but which shall not. Is that satisfactory
answer, if it is any? Do you remember your question?
For the time being you need do nothing about Narendra Dev. I
shall inquire. I do not know anything about the Dehra Dun offer.
Prabhavati wrote for the transfer of Jayaprakash on the ground of
ill health, which is patent. Her application is summarily rejected. They
can’t do anything because it is right. They yield only to pressure
bordering on violence. We are on that portion of Ramayana  which
relates Narad’s confusion because he had to be corrected. Truly does
God confound the wisdom of those whom He seeks to destroy. Here is a
telegram about Ratlam. I have already written to you about the case.3

114. INTERVIEW TO H. V. KAMATH1
SEVAGRAM ,
September 5, 1941
Q. Has the entry of Russia into the war altered its complexion and India’s attitude
thereto?
A. The entry of Russia into the war has not materially altered the
complexion of the war. Expression of oral sympathy with Russia as a
victim of aggression is not wrong but no purpose will be served by so
doing so long as we cannot translate it into action. Russia is not wholly
free from blame inasmuch as she has allied herself with imperialist
power though it may be for the purpose of self-existence only. Had
Jawaharlalji, who is a close student of international politics, not been
behind the bars and thus free to express his views, his opinion in the
matter would have weighed with me.
Q. Can you, Mahatmaji, envisage the emergence of a non-violent new world
order in the Atlantic Charter?
A. No. I am not able to envisage in the Atlantic Charter the
emergence of a non-violent new world order of my conception.
Q. What is your attitude towards the acceptance of office in the Viceroy’s
Executive Council by Congressmen such as Sjt. Aney2 and Mr. Nalini Ranjan Sircar3?
A. I do not approve of the acceptance of office by Congressmen
such as Sri Aney and Nalini Babu. Such action on their part has
undoubtedly given a handle to the British Government for carrying on
propaganda in America to the effect that India should now be satisfied
in that even well-known ex-Congressmen have joined the Viceroy’s
Council.
Q. Is the satyagraha movement proceeding to your satisfaction? In what way is it
1 H. V. Kamath, Organizing Secretary of the All-India Forward Bloc, submitted
this report for Gandhiji’s approval who revised it in places, though not very materially.
2  Madhav Srihari Aney who joined as member-in-charge, Overseas Indians
3  Who joined as member-in-charge, Education, Health and LandsVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 61different from the 1930 movement1? Has the policy of non-embarrassment any political
value or significance? What will be your attitude in case the Government conceded the
right of freedom of speech? Is there any likelihood of intensification of the struggle in
the near future?
A. The satyagraha movement is proceeding to my entire
satisfaction. Pressure on a scale comparable to that of the 1930
movement is not being put on the Government, it is true, but that
movement was different in character from the present one. But the main
fact that the struggle is going on constitutes sufficient moral pressure, so
much so that the British Government’s position in America does not
appear to be quite comfortable. The policy of non-embarrassment is a
logical consequence of non-violence and in that way a political
necessity, but I do not expect the British Government to reciprocate my
chivalrous stand. There is no possibility of the Government conceding
the right of freedom of speech, but if they did so honestly, I am bound
to call off the movement. Bona-fide  recognition of free non-violent
speech would mean a large step towards independence. Intensification
of the struggle is not likely during the pendency of the war.
Intensification will come at the close of the war if it became necessary.
Q What is your attitude to the local kisan and mazdoor  struggles?
A. I extend my sympathy to all local kisan and mazdoor struggles
for their legitimate demands and such struggles cannot amount to
embarrassment of the Government. My attitude cannot be otherwise,
considering that I myself have been the author of such struggles in the
past.
Q. In view of the fact that the word ‘non-violence’ does not appear in the
Congress Constitution, what is the duty of Congressmen as regards non-violent
conduct?
A. Though the word ‘non-violence’ does not appear in the
Congress Constitution, it does in resolutions. Though there be no
resolution of a plenary session of the Congress on the subject of
non-violence, I expect Congressmen to abide by the A.I.C.C. resolution
so long as it is not modified or altered by a plenary session.
Q. Acharya Kripalani recently, in reply to Sardar Sardul Singh Caveeshar, said
that the Forward Bloc is not a part of the Congress organization. The statementon
Kripalaniji’s  part has  created not a little confusion and misunderstanding among
several Congressmen. I personally hold that the position of the Forward Bloc in the
Congress is quite similar to that of the Congress Socialist Party. Could you kindly
1 Dandi March and Salt Satyagraha62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIenlighten me with your opinion on the subject?
A. Though the Congress Constitution does not recognize separate
groups within the Congress organization, Congressmen who owe
allegiance to such groups have every right to remain in the Congress in
their individual capacity if the groups are not inconsistent with the
Congress resolution and policy. I never insisted that Congressmen who
do not subscribe to my interpretation of non-violence should leave the
Congress. The Congress Socialist Party is just as much not a part of the
Congress organization as the Forward Bloc. The Congress Constitution
makes no mention of either as being component parts of the Congress
organization. The Forward Bloc and the Congress Socialist Party are on
a par with each other so far as their being part of the Congress
organization is concerned.
Q. Have you, Mahatmaji, full faith in a Divine Power moulding our destiny?
A. Yes, I have full faith in a Divine Power guiding the destinies of India
and of the world. It is this living faith that sustains me in the present
crisis.

115. LETTER TO SARANGADHAR DAS
SEVAGRAM , WARDHA,
September 6, 1941
DEAR SARANGADHAR DAS,
Rajkumari is resting in Simla. She won’t be back before October.
Your letter to her gives a piteous tale.
This is my advice. The men whose statements you have translated
had no notion of the working of ahimsa. If they had the courage of
non-violence they could not have come away alive except by converting
their assailants miscalled Police without retaliation. That would mean
ahimsa of the highest order. This does not come except by long previo-
us training. It is rarely seen. But if one cannot exhibit such courage, one
must not be a coward. One has not only the right but it is a duty to
retaliate in a vigorous manner. This again requires great courage. I have,
seen it exhibited successfully. It should not matter how heavy the odds
are. Resistance may mean death. It must be faced in preference to a
cowardly resignatio to brutal and indecent treatment.Iti this self-defence
which is not taboo to a Congressman. It is the inherent right and the
bounden duty of a man to defend honour non-violently if he knows
how, otherwise violently. There is no other way. Such a man will soonVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 63be able to learn the virtue of non-violence. But that is only by the way.
My advice is clear and emphatic. There is too much of this assaulting in
Orissa, assuming the truth of statements that have been sent to me from
time to time. If you have assimilated my advice you will act in a
methodical and deliberate manner. You will be at liberty to publish this
letter with a carefully thought out programme as to how to go about it.
You may send me the draft manifesto for approval or you may come
when you like for a discussion before acting. The matter is too
important to be ignored.

Can you accommodate both the sisters ? How is it your studies get
constantly interrupted ? I shall not let you sit for the examination if you
are not fully prepared. There should be no question which you cannot
answer. If you cannot be so well prepared by April, then you may sit for
the examination later. I am not in a hurry. The knowledge you have
gained is not going to be wasted, and so, if it takes some more time, so
be it. Because, I also do not wish that you should spoil your eyes and
health by continuously reading night and day in order to pass. Passing

examination not for name but for service.

The Ashram is now becoming very crowded. Vijaya and

 129. LETTER TO BHAGWANJI P. PANDYA
September 8, 1941
CHI. BHAGWANJI,
I have your letter. I got Puratan’s also. He is displeased that you
sent his five-year-old note without his consent. It is his opinion now, i.e.,
after five years’ experience, that Dada is a spotless and simple-hearted
man. Bhai Puratan believes that the allegation against Dada is the result
of a conspiracy by some Harijans. I share his belief. These people have
suffered so much that they have lost their humanity. This is of course
not true of all of them. We must bear with all this. But while doing so we
should not be misled into entertaining suspicions against anybody.
I understand Narahari’s criticism. It is a fact that you are
collecting evidence. In doing so you cannot but start whisperings
among the people. This would foul the atmosphere. And, moreover, you
are forgetting your sphere of work. This is bound to interfere with your
work. Why do you make yourself a watchman of anyone in the
Ashram? It will be enough if others, you and I, all become our own
watchmen. Supervision is Narahari’s job. If anybody wants to complain
let him do so to him. You should plug your ears. I have a beautiful
figure of three monkeys, which I always keep in front of me. They are
three representations of the same monkey. His ears, mouth and eyes are
closed. The lesson the figure teaches is that one should not listen to
criticism of or see or speak of anybody’s defects. The original of this
figure is found on a tall pillar in Japan, and was carved thousands of
years ago. We should engrave this lesson in our hearts.
I will hear what you have to say when you come here. I am not
inclined at present to send for anybody else. I would send for others
1 Vide “Statement to the Press”, 12-5-194170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIonly if I myself am shaken even a little in my mind. But if Narahari is
positive in his view, I would not disregard him and make any inquiry.
You may, with Narahari’s consent, stay for 15 days or more. But you
need not come or stay specially for the sake of Nimu. She will get
somebody to accompany her.

CHI. NARANDAS,
I have your letter of the 1st. I have already suggested Jajuji’s
name for Rentia Baras programme. You must have received that letter
long ago.1 Jajuji’s other programmes have been suspended in view of
that visit. He will be ready to give you eight to ten days. I should now
get from you the programme drawn up for him.
Chhaganlal2 was here for a day. He has assured me that he will
complete [the figure]. If necessary he will go as far as Rangoon. The
papers report that you have had some rain there. Did you have enough?
It is Prabhashankar3 about whom I am not sure, but would not
Champa4 also be included? Poor thing, she would do what he asks her to
do. And that is natural. I had even gone to the extent of arranging that
he should come here while Maganbhai5 was here. M. is in Delhi now,
and will come again in October. After spending a few days here, he
intends to go to Rangoon around the 20th. I got your letter afterwards.
Information about Jajuji is enclosed. It is better that my message should
be conveyed by Jajuji himself. It is too early just yet.

CHI. SUSHILA,
Again there is no letter from you today. But, considering your
circumstances, I should not expect a letter from you daily.
I have left it entirely to you to decide where Pyarelal has to be
operated upon for his gland. You alone can say where it would be best
to have it. Your convenience will no doubt be a factor to consider. You
will get this on Tuesday. You must free yourself from there on Friday. I
should not worry if you are required there for two or three days. But it
is possible that the operation may not be over by that time and you may
not be able to free yourself from there in time. The earliest it can be
done in Delhi would be on the 16th. Pyarelal can reach there on the
11th at the earliest. He will have to spend five days there. If it is
necessary, he may as well spend those days with Mother. Now think
about it yourself.

SEVAGRAM ,
September 8 , 1941
CHI. PYARELAL,
I  have  received  your  letter. I  do not think it advisable for you
to  have the operation in Wardha. If facilities are easily available in
Bombay or  Delhi, I see no need to have it done in Wardha. I would go
by Sushila’s decision in this matter. If she  decides in  favour of
Bombay, it  does  not  matter if she has to waste two or  three days. But
she  would  probably  prefer  Delhi. She can give more   personal
 attention there. In my opinion Sushila should reach Delhi by the 15th.
I would consider unavoidable the time spent in undergoing the
operation. One may take into consideration the effect it may have on
others. But I would treat it as of very little importance. The main thing is
the effect it may have on me and on you. I do not think it will make any
difference in this regard. I would not like to detain you with me. I
would also not like it if you stayed on there or in Delhi without any72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIvalid reason. But so far, not a single day has passed like that. Hence, I
am not anxious.

If evil thoughts come to mind it means that the mind is empty and
Nature abhors a vacuum. So when the mind is not reciting Ramanama
or doing His work, then the Devil takes possession of it. So when evil

Ramanama and to do Rama’s work. It can never fail. Go on increasing

There can be no answer to the reproach you have to face. But you
can correct the misconception without getting angry. The
misconception will be strengthened if you get angry. But it can be
corrected if you do it good-humouredly. In case you do not know, let
me tell you that lately I had a letter from Nilla1 in which she has
expressed her longing to come back to me. Because, she says, she found

BHAI MUNSHI,
I have read your long letter. I can understand your agony. But it
will take you forward. If at first you had my support, you are not
without it now. Is this not what many people believe?
I want to drive out from your mind the idea that we absolutely
cannot do without foreign help.1 The examples of China, Russia and
England cannot apply to us. China, after attaining freedom, seeks
outside help in order to fight Japan. Russia and England are already
free. We may also seek help from a thousand quarters after we have
become free, but only if we have gained our freedom with force of
1 The addressee had written: “And I see no disgrace in accepting help from a
foreign power in order to protect India’s nationalism and unity— that power may be
Britain today, and who knows which other power after the War! What is China doing? Is
not Russia taking foreign help? Is not England doing it?”80 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIarms. Freedom won through non-violent means will need no help, or it
will need the entire world’s. All this is so clear that you should have no
difficulty in understanding it. But if you do have any, please find some
time to come over here at least to get your doubt resolved. This is a very
important issue. In the context in which you made your statement1, it
does not at all seem proper. The fight about Pakistan is a fight between
two brothers. One can get reconciled to one brother being- defeated at
the hands of the other; but the one who wins with the help of a third
party will himself become a slave and also make the other a slave.
Whom are the British helping today? Where does Pakistan exist in the
present situation? Akhanda Hindustan2, on the other hand, does exist as
a dream at any rate. He who seeks to realize that dream may be no more
than a dust particle floating in the sky but after all it is floating. Its
dream lifts it above; it does not cast it down. Its exercise of individual
freedom makes it shine brightly in the sky. Whose help can it require?
And if all the particles get together, that is, recognize their individuality,
then they themselves will be the sky. Can you conceive a sky without
particles? You, therefore, who are out to fight for an Akhanda
Hindustan can never entertain the idea of seeking external help. It does
you no credit. It ill becomes the maturity of your thinking. If I go on
further I would be only wasting time. But what need to argue at length
with the wise?

the cause of Indian independence for which the Congress is fighting?” Gandhiji replied:
If I did not believe so I would have come out with a statement
without any prompting from you.  But I sincerely believe that my
silence is much more eloquent than any words that I may utter.  After

Without such purification he is likely to do only harm. He is a good

It is good you have gone to Delhi. I would leave the matter of the
operation to Dr. Joshi. If he says that considering everything it is
advisable to perform the operation, get it done. I would not insist if he
does not think it necessary. Get your teeth thoroughly examined. If you
do not wish to have it done there, have it done by Bareto. On your
return you can stay at Nagpur for a day and have your teeth checked.
As for the books, etc., you may do whatever you wish.

MY DEAR IDIOT,
Sushila came yesterday and gone today. Prabha has [been] to her
mother for two or three days just to feed her superstition. Her brother
had a child born and she has to attend some ceremony. She returns on

suspicion of tuberculosis. Dr. David however says there is no trace. But
she had slow fever and has grown weak.
I have two deputations—Alla Bux1 and Sidhwa2 and the other

Munshi’s daughter Sarala who is here for a few days has taken
Prabha’s place. She is a very fine girl. She is one of the three Indian
women solicitors in all India. But she is exceedingly simple in her tastes

SEVAGRAM ,
September 14, 1941
BHAI SUBEDAR1,
I have your letter. I think you have again fallen into a trap. The
Quaid-e-Azam has made no definite proposal. He only wants to prove
the two-nation theory and partition the country. We need not pay
attention to him, as we would not to anybody who wanted to separate
two brothers.
The charges against the Congress have been disproved, but if they
have not they can be referred to an impartial tribunal.
As long as the policy of keeping at a distance from both the
Government and the Congress and using concessions by either side for
extracting more from the other remains, no understanding seems
possible. A party following such a policy will never be satisfied with
what it gets.
I am convinced that the riots in Sind, Dacca and Ahmedabad were
intended to intimidate the Congress. But I am ready to ignore this. That
is, all the points may be referred to an impartial tribunal. I don’t think
anything else is possible.
And please also remember that ultimately the people themselves
will decide these questions and bypass us all. I would, therefore, advise
you to extricate yourself from this business, or to proceed on the basis
of certain fundamental principles. It will be enough if you cling to even
one. As long as he does not decide about coming to an agreement
among ourselves, no discussion is possible.

 181. WORK FOR EVERYONE
I have sent a message for women and children to this effect:2
Enough khadi can be produced if children up to the age of twelve and
women gave a few hours of their spare time to spinning and other
processes of khadi production. I had asked Krishnadas Gandhi to work
out some figures to prove the above contention. I give below an abstract
of the findings.
India’s population was estimated at about 35 crores in the
1931 census. Children in the age-group of eight to twelve
numbered about 4_ crores and women and girls above the age
of 12 numbered about 11 crores. If the children devoted four
hours to cleaning, carding and spinning and if the women
devoted four hours to cleaning, carding, spinning and weaving
daily, enough khadi can be produced. It can be shown by
calculation that the children can produce every day yarn of ten
to twelve counts that can be woven into 90 lac square yards of
khadi, whereas the women can produce every day two crore
square yards of twenty counts in addition to weaving the ninety
lac square yards of khadi out of the yarn spun by the children.
It  has  been  calculated  that the entire process from the
cleaning of  cotton to weaving a  20 counts  square  yard of
cloth involves 18  hours  of  labour  on  the part of one person.
Out  of  this half  an hour will go to the cleaning of cotton, two
hours for carding, 12 hours for spinning, one hour for
1 This was in reply to the addressee’s letter forwarded by the jail authorities on
September 17, 1941.
2 Vide”Message to People of Ahmedabad”, 8-9-1941VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 97unwinding the yarn, one hour for making and fixing the warp
and sizing and one and a half hours for actual weaving. This is
the breakdown of the total of 18 hours. It is based on the
average skill of an average person. An efficient worker may
complete this process in just 15 hours. On a rough estimate the
women and children can, with such skill as they have, produce
about 30 square yards of khadi for every person in this country
by working four hours a day for 300 days in a year.
My object in publishing this abstract is to encourage an institution
to undertake an experiment to corroborate it. Any family can easily
produce all the cloth that it requires by introducing a charkha and a
loom in their home. Suppose there are 35 individuals in an institution
including four children in the age-group of 8 to 12 and 11 women
above the age of 13. All men, of course, will be busy with other
activities. Ten out of the eleven women and all the four children can
devote three to four hours every day to cleaning, carding, spinning and
weaving according to their convenience. One of the ten women will help
the four children and will also weave the yarn produced by the children.
The remaining nine women will undertake all the work from cleaning to
weaving. According to the calculations given above, the four children
together with one woman will produce at least three fourths of a square
yard of 10 to 12 counts khadi every day and the 9 women will easily
produce two square yards of 20 counts khadi every day. If we calculate
for 300 days in a year, all of them will together produce 225 square
yards of coarse khadi and 600 square yards of fine khadi. Thus a total
of 825 square yards of cloth will be available for the 35 persons or, in
other words, everyone will get 23_ square yards of cloth. As the
efficiency grows every individual will be able to get 27_ square yards of
cloth.
It should be remembered that so much cloth can be produced
even in less time by using the now improved charkhas and carding-
bows. If every home has a charkha and a loom we can produce the cloth
we need with very little effort. It will create a great contentment in the
home. We can only imagine what an impact this can have on our lives
and how it can inspire all the people. But for oneself one can instantly
discover this bliss.

Khadi Jagat, September 194198 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI182. BLANKETS FOR SOLDIERS
It is a good augury that votaries of non-violence often raise fine
questions of principle. Man advances through such spirit of inquiry, but
there is a prerequisite condition to it. The inquiry should not be like that
of a person who strains at a gnat and swallows a camel. Raising such
questions profit only him who is ever vigilant in major matters and
whose practice keeps pace with the progress of the principle.
Let me illustrate what I mean. A certain khadi bhandar received an
order for woollen blankets from the military. The bhandar authorities
asked me whether they could accept it replied that they could. The
question of principle raised was whether it did not amount to helping
the war.
As a matter of abstract principle, it will have to be conceded that
the acceptance was a breach. But in that case, we must leave India and
every country engaged in the war. Because we help war in purchasing
the very food we eat. We do the same when we travel by train or buy
postage stamps. Our use of the currency itself is an aid to war. In fact we
are hardly able to do any act which is free from the taint.
The truth is that no one is able to act upon a great principle, like
that of non-violence, in its entirety. Like the geometrical line, it can only
be imagined, but never drawn. In practice, we have to be content with
drawing only such fine lines as we can with our instruments. There is no
wall which can be called ‘straight’ according to Euclid. And yet, walls
have stood the test of time for thousands of years. It is the same with
ahimsa. We must put it into practice as best as we can.
It would have been easy for me to forbid the sale of the blankets.
It was a question of only a few thousand rupees, a small amount for an
establishment whose turnover is in lakhs. But the prohibition would have
been a matter of shame for me. I could have done so only by
concealing my real view of the matter. Where should I draw the line
from which such prohibition should commence? If I were a grain
merchant, should I decline to sell it to soldiers? Or, if I were a chemist,
should  I refuse  to sell  quinine  and  other drugs  to them?  If  I
should, what c ould be the reason for my doing  so?   Does my ahimsa
prevent  me  from  entertaining  such  customers?  In other  words,  does
it require of  me  to look  into  the  occupations of my  customers?  TheVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 99clear reply is that provided I deal in goods which conduce to the welfare
of society, I may not look into the occupations of my customers. This
means that I may sell my innocuous articles even to soldiers.

Khadi Jagat, September 1941
183. UNCERTIFIED KHADI
One who purchases uncertified khadi is ignorant of the purpose of
khadi, which was conceived as a simple means to remove the poverty of
Daridranarayana , which alone can improve India’s economic condition
and ultimately win freedom. Therein lies the importance of khadi and if
khadi has to play its role in removing the poverty of the millions it must
be under the control of some organization or State authority. Crores of
spinners would be willing to spin for eight hours for a paltry pice for
they must fill their bellies. Khadi made from yarn spun by them may be
called hand-spun but by its use we certainly will not be serving
Daridranarayana . The Charkha Sangh has therefore at once increased
the spinners’ wages and attempts are being made to improve the
economic condition of other artisans.
Those who sell uncertified khadi are guilty of theft from
khadi-artisans. To purchase such khadi is to acquire stolen property.
This is atrocious. The Charkha Sangh therefore appeals to business
people to take up some other trade instead of selling [uncertified]
khadi. The public should purchase khadi from khadi bhandars of the
Charkha Sangh or its certified depots only.
I hope all khadi-lovers will agree that khadi, be it dear or cheap,
should be purchased only through the Charkha Sangh and such khadi
alone should be recognized as khadi.

BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
I have your letter. It seems best now to go through the
homoeopathic treatment. Don’t mind if that means some loss of time.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 101You must keep patient till you are sure whether or no it is benefiting
you.
I am glad you met. . .1 He does not at all seem clear in his mind.
About Valji also it is difficult to judge. He has got very much
prejudiced. I think he also will come round.
I understand about Lilavati. When you have taken her case in
hand, why need I worry about her? I did not wish to worry you with her
problem, though. She is hard working and smart. I hope she will pass.
But she has got a little tired. I hope Bhanumati2 is all right. So it now
seems certain that the girl3 will not survive.
Has Bhulabhai been released? He seems to be quite ill.

I had long and frank talks with Khan Bahadur (Alla Bux). He is
now going to Karachi. From there he will go to see Maulana. I am
firmly of the view that the Congress should leave the Assembly. Khan
Bahadur also, if he is on the Congress side, should do the same. The
Congress in Sind helping the war effort while not doing so elsewhere
would produce—is producing—a bad impression. Keeping up this
arrangement will not benefit the country in any way, neither Sind nor
1 OrangesVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 105the Hindus nor the Muslims. Can a wrong step benefit anybody? Even if
there were no war, I would be in favour of the Congress leaving the
Assembly in Sind. But that is a side issue just now. I will discuss it with
you if you wish. Here, I have explained how my mind is working, so
that you may be able to understand Khan Bahadur correctly. He says he
is convinced by my reasoning.

Free yourself from worry and go on increasing your knowledge.

I have brought Ram Saran Das in Annapurna’s place. He is
wholly free from fever. He is being given sufficient milk. Following the
extraction of his teeth, his face has changed. The bad breath too has
largely gone. He himself feels as though he had got a new life. The
moment the teeth were taken out, his temperature started going down.
Nirmal Singh too has been improving since yesterday. The
ganglion is dissolved. He has not been given milk as yet. He was given
barely water today. He himself asked for it. So, there is no patient here.
As for Chakrayya, I myself give him food in measured quantities. He is
keeping well. I shall not write to Annapurna today.

September 20, 1941
BHAI PRITHVI SINGH,
Your letter is good and so is your question. For the dearth of
khadi I do not blame anyone. Everyone works according to his
capacity. The problem of khadi is difficult. Even those who were not
habitual khadi-wearers buy some. The highest consumption of khadi is
in Bombay. Is not khadi our dharma? Dharma as such is difficult to
follow. Having said so much, I who am its pioneer cannot be credited
with perfect tapascharya . I am not sorry for it. I have done my best. But
the non-stop plying of the wheel that you suggest is no small matter.
There are such devotees, aren’t there? Some day khadi is bound to
become universal.
Now about Russia. We can do nothing. I do not find much
difference between the three. It is true that much has been done in
Russia for the people. The slaughter that is going on does not raise my
hair. The civil war mentioned in the Bhagawata may be imaginary, but
in real life it is true. When violence increases in the world internecine
wars are bound to take place. Out of this will non-violence be born if
there are some truly non-violent people. I believe we are such people. I
cannot say how ahimsa will be born. This power is beyond description.
It can be seen only in its impact. God alone  regulates it. My peace and
my firmness are based on this faith: See what Russia has done. Once it
took help from Germany and now from England. Who can say what
Russia will do if she loses? From the point of view of ahimsa today we
can be no more but [mute] witnesses of this slaughter. Yes, but when an
occasion arises we should be ready for sacrifice.
Kishorelalbhai will write something on non-violent exercise.

Principles can have no exception. Two plus two can only be four.
If I have made a mistake, it must be called a mistake. Can there be a
different duty under stress? A mistake committed under stress may be
pardonable. The moment Yudhishthira uttered a small falsehood, his
chariot-wheel came down to earth.1 When I say that those who are not
able to practise ahimsa should prefer violence to cowardice, I am not

September 23, 1941
CHI. KAKA,
What you write is certainly worth thinking over. I thought over it
but finally came to the conclusion that Jamnalalji’s ability could fully
develop only in goseva1 work. Though we have a Goseva Sangh, the
work remains neglected. We have been able to get neither experts nor
money. We have only been able to prepare the ground. The work can
be done, however, only if an experienced man dedicates himself to it.
Harijan work has got going and is getting on the rails. What is being
done is necessary. Ultimately it is the awakening among Harijans
themselves that will solve the problem.
Work is being done among sanatanists also, though it is true that
no publicity is being given to it. Being a dedicated Harijan worker,
1 Service of the cowVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 115J[amnalalji] will be able to win over many sanatanists while engaged in
goseva. Finally, when you read the accompanying letter1, the position
will be clearer to you. Return the letter. There is one special reason also.
J[amnalalji] wants to cultivate greater purity. He craves for purity of
mind. Service of the cow might satisfy his craving, for the cow is more
mute than even the Harijans. If we do not look after her, she will not
rebel, but die. Harijans, on the other hand, are being taught by us to
rebel. If we don’t teach them, others are eager to do so. In the Bharatiya
Parishad2, I think Abdul Haq Saheb had proposed a resolution to the
effect that Hindi-Urdu should be adopted in place of Hindi-Hindustani.
What was the resolution, if not this?

216. LETTER TO VITHALDAS JERAJANI
September 23, 1941
BHAI VITHALDAS,
I had meant to write to you when I saw your English letter to
Jajuji, but I could not manage it. I have now your Gujarati letter.
Why did you write in English? We can never pour out our hearts
in English. A man like Jawaharlal may be able to do that for he has
studied English since his childhood, and he learnt it in England. But let
that be.
There is some error in your reasoning. If we wish to open small
stores everywhere, we shall necessarily have to entrust each store to one
man only. We cannot employ another man to help him. You do not
seem to have any experience of village stores. Poor village
store-keepers, how can they afford assistants? If the man leaves his store,
he will shut the door and lock it up, and then go out. If he has a son, he
might perhaps leave it in his charge. In South Africa thousands of stores
are run by our people and by Jews, and they are, each of them, in
charge of one person only.  It would  not  be paying  to  have more
than  one  person.   And  in most cases the person  lives  just  behind
the  store itself.  If he has to  leave  the  store  for any reason, he will
shut  the  door  and   go  out.  The store has stocks hardly worth Rs.
500. How can the man, then, afford an assistant? Moreover, we are
1 This is not available.
2 Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad116 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdreaming of ushering in a new age, the age of ahimsa . We should keep
our stores open only for reasonable periods, not from six in the
morning till twelve at night. In England the stores are closed at fixed
hours by law. We should follow that practice voluntarily. The English in
India do so. But irrespective of their practice, we should arrange our
affairs on the basis of the law of ahimsa. We should, therefore, plan the
whole thing from that point of view.
I believe that we should give thought to the question of location,
too.
I agree with your view that the science of sales is different from
that of production. And as the science of khadi production is different
from the science of production of other goods, so also is the science of
khadi sales different from the science of selling of other goods. We have
always postponed thinking about this matter. The little thought we have
occasionally given to the matter is not enough. Morning is when we
wake up. I have now been making the khadi world think about this
matter.
Our work is not being controlled by one man, but we have still not
been fully organized as an institution either. The reason is that we have
not trained the requisite number of workers. We started no school for
them. Now we have started one1. Let us see how it fares.
The implication of your English letter was that the question
should be considered by the Council. I think that the time for that has
not yet come. First, Jajuji, you and I should think about it. Finally, of
course, the Council will have to consider the matter. The objection you
took in your English letter to Jajuji expressing his views seemed
altogether improper to me. If a secretary does his duty cons-
cientiously, he must guide the others. That you did not approve of his
suggestions was a different matter. But so long as we accept a man as
secretary, he is bound to guide us.

[After September 23 , 1941]1
CHI. PANNALAL,
How could anyone have imagined that Nanibehn would leave
us so suddenly ? I cannot forget her ever-smiling face, yet I must. The
soul that dwelt in her body is of course immortal. Our concern was with
that soul. That remains. Let us emulate her good qualities and character.
There is no need to preach anything to you. Gangabehn too
 is competent.

Submissiveness is both a virtue and a vice. Circumstances
determine the quality each time. Are you satisfied?
I told J[amnalal he] was not looking well. He does not feel it
either. The Nainital visit took it out of him.
You did write to me about your Conference taking a village. It
might be possible to find someone. We shall discuss when you return.
The cottage is undergoing extensions.
Khadi Jagat is in the press. The Maharajah’s order can be
reported only next month which will be done.

Pyarelal is returning today or the day after. Prabha has
returned. Vijaya will be coming in for a few days, so will Vasumati.
Ramdas has been transferred to Nagpur. So Nimu and children will also
come for a few days. And so the Ashram remains full. There are one or
two new arrivals.
There is a clean bill of health.

press everybody to come on the 4th. But it will be better if you consult
in advance all those whose presence you consider necessary. It suppose

There is a letter from you today. I am not happy about your
studies getting interrupted for one reason or another. But neither you
nor anyone else can do anything about it. It must be as God wills.
Annapurna has also been a burden to some extent. I had thought
that she would not get any fever there. She will no doubt recover with
your treatment. But I shall be anxious until that happens.
I shall discuss Mother with Pyarelal. Difficulties will certainly
arise if things do not turn out the way you write. Mother herself is so
considerate that she will not be a burden to me. However, we shall do as
you wish. I shall not insist in any way. I shall be fully prepared. I am
absolutely fine. All the patients are well. Chakrayya had a fit of epilepsy

 SEVAGRAM ,
September 25, 1941
BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
Nanibehn Jhaveri has passed away. This seems incredible, but it is
one of those acts of God which nobody can comprehend.
I understand about Allah Bux. I have of course told him that we
will accept Maulana’s decision. But I have also told him at the same
time that, if he is convinced of the necessity of leaving, he should
convince Maulana also and, resigning his office, go into the wilderness
with the Congress. There is no breach of promise or anything like that
in this. But let us leave it alone. When you come, we shall have a brief
discussion about the pros and cons of the suggestion. My view
regarding Sind is not new. But the old view has grown stronger and I
hold it to be applicable to all provinces. I am in no hurry. The
suggestion can be acted upon only if most of us accept it. “Most”
includes Maulana also.
Do give, within reasonable limits, the time required by
homoeopathy to cure you. I have heard much about the water at Hajira,
but do not know about Deolali. Hajira may possibly agree with you.
Everything else failing, you can try nature cure. But we should first
meet and have a brief discussion.
The little girl’s illness is getting prolonged. It seems from
Manibehn’s letter that she may even survive.
Rajendra Babu is all right. Jamnalalji’s problem cannot still be
said to have been solved.
I hope Bhulabhai will get well.

There is no letter from you today. Pyarelal did not come
yesterday. I presume he will be coming today.
I might say I am doing very well. The patients are all fine. The
right treatment for Chakrayya still eludes us. Prabhakar’s case is
peculiar. He is not having fever. He does not suffer from itch because
he is not being given food. However, he continues to be troubled by
sexual craving, and has discharges frequently. If you can think of a
cause for this, let me know.
You must have adjusted your routine for studying.

There will be no mosquitoes if you stay at Sevagram and sleep under

I learnt, by chance, only the day before yesterday about your
having failed. You have not failed only in one subject. This indicates
that you lack aptitude for law. This is true of many people. There have
been great men who were deficient in certain capacities. Everybody
cannot be a mathematician. One should follow the path indicated by
one’s gifts. I would, therefore, urge you to give up your ambition of
passing the examination and to devote yourself exclusively to your
business. Whatever little knowledge of law you have acquired will
remain with you. I do wish, of course, that you should improve your
English. But if you are disinclined to that labour, I will not insist on that
either. I should also like you to be tested thoroughly by an able
professor and you should then agree to learn whatever subject he finds
you have an aptitude for. I wish, too, that you should come here as early
as possible and take the children to Rangoon. Urmi is pining for
Rangoon all the time. She has now got tired of Sevagram. Appa has not
been happy here from the very beginning. In these circumstances, the
children will not progress. From every point of view, therefore, I suggest
that you come over here, have a discussion and then go to Rangoon.

If Mother does come, I would like to shift to the old hut and the
portion of the hospital which I am using. I would return to the hospital
where  Mother  can  stay. Sankaran  will no doubt serve her well.
Mother can  separately  cook  for herself  whatever  she  wants.  Pyarelal132 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthinks that Mother can help in the hospital. What do you think about all
this ? Consult Mother also.

258. GUARD AGAINST CREDIT
In this business of khadi, as in any other, I know that we sell on
credit to increase the sales but ultimately suffer losses. While I was
practising law in South Africa I used to examine the accounts of
hundreds of businessmen who were my clients. They used to provide 25
per cent for bad debts.  As a result they would charge a very high rate
of profit. Some of them would go bankrupt. My experience of
conducting Indian Opinion, Navajivan, Young  India  and  Harijan  has
shown me that  we  escaped  losses because we never sold on credit. NorVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 137did this policy adversely affect the number of our subscribers. One
direct benefit of this policy was that only those subscribed to these
periodicals who cared for them. There can however be no comparison
between khadi and other kinds of business. Khadi is an altruistic affair.
It is conceived as service to the starving millions. Then why should we
sell khadi on credit?
My personal conviction therefore is that under no circumstances
and to no person should we sell khadi on credit. If we firmly followed
this policy we shall spare ourselves much unnecessary expenditure and
can even bring down the price of khadi. And simultaneously we shall be
able to give our customers satisfaction.
It is a general rule of the Charkha Sangh that no bhandar under its
jurisdiction shall release goods on credit. I am afraid everyone has not
been able to observe this rule hundred per cent. I submit that mere
enunciation of a rule whose importance we cannot appreciate is not
much good. I hope, therefore, that all khadi workers will clearly
understand the policy of not giving credit and then follow it unfailingly.

262. SPEECH AT GOSEVA SANGH MEETING
NALWADI,
September 30, 1941
You should adopt a simple and brief constitution without
provision for so many categories of members. All the members should
be of  one category and there should be no patrons at all.  Those  who
contribute  will  do  so  not  for the sake of  name.  Some  of  them
may  contribute anonymously  and may  not  even like  to  disclose
their names.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 139You don’t stand to gain by having various categories of
membership. The members are not going to have any privileges. Our
purpose is to render service, not to enjoy privileges. Even ten or twenty
members capable of rendering concrete service would suffice. Every
member must be bound by the condition to use only cow’s milk, ghee,
etc., and leather made from dead cattle. In this no laxity should be
permitted. A small committee to carry on the work of the society may
be formed.
I formed the opinion, even while in South Africa, that we would
have to give up the lure of buffalo’s milk and ghee. Cow-protection
helps protection of the buffalo also. It cannot be that everybody would
give up buffalo’s milk but there is real danger of people giving up
cow’s milk. If, therefore, we do not protect the cow, both the buffalo
and the cow are sure to be doomed.
 Our fault is—this is a fault found in all men, but more
particularly among Indians—that we grab what is easily available and we
let go what is difficult to obtain. People find khadi, village industries
organization and the like inexpensive and convenient. They prefer
buffalo milk because it is sweet and cheap.
Since the times of the Vedas we have been glorifying the cow—
not the buffalo. Had the cow not been so glorified, it would have
perished and along with it the buffalo. I have studied the comparative
figures of the cows and buffaloes in India. Both are in plenty but
neither of them is making any progress. So long as it pays him, the
milkman keeps the cow or the buffalo after which he sells them to the
butcher. The butcher utilizes the proceeds for purchasing more cattle.
The cow-protectionwallahs purchase these cows or buffaloes in order to
save them from the butcher’s knife. A couple of cows are saved in this
manner but it spells disaster for the cow in general. The correct remedy,
therefore, lies in forgetting the cow already sold and in investing funds
for improving the breed, raising its value and in teaching cattle-keepers
their dharma.
Let no one fear that the buffalo will become extinct if all give up
its milk and ghee. As I have already told you this will hardly happen
and even if it did there would be no harm. The buffalo will return to the
jungle. What we must protect is the cow and, because the milk of both is
useful, the buffalo will also be saved along with the cow. But if instead
of following the scientific method everybody, in the name of
cow-protection,  sets  about acting  according  to his  own fancy, both
the cow   and the buffalo  are sure to he  doomed.  It was  mainly
owing to our ignorance that so many other things in our country
similarly  met  their  doom.  We  can  realize our duty towards the140 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIanimal world and discharge it by wisely pursuing our dharma of service
to the cow. At the root of cow-protection is the realization of our
dharma towards the sub-human species. But our service to the cow is
service only in name and all of us are therefore tending to forget our
dharma.
Statistically speaking, India has one-fourth of the world’s cattle
population. But the plight of our cattle is worse than that of the human
population, bad as it is.
One who serves the cow must take cow’s milk only and not goat’s
milk. I take goat’s milk out of my helplessness. But the members of the
Cow-protection Society must take only cow’s milk and ghee and use
only leather made from dead cows and buffaloes. Where even cows and
buffaloes are being slaughtered, how can one get leather made from
dead goats? Mankind has till this day taken it for granted that the goat is
born only to be butchered. Today being Dussehra, in Calcutta
thousands of goats must have been sacrificed to Goddess Kali.
Ghee should not present any problem for the rich. Just as they
carry with them some lavender, Eau de Cologne and a toothbrush,
similarly they should also have cow’s ghee or else they should not think
of cow-protection. The problem of milk is not as simple as that of ghee.
In Almora cow’s milk is not available at any cost. The same condition
prevails in Orissa. We can make milk by dissolving mava1 in water. We
use Horlicks powder because it is a good thing and easily digestible. But
why should we not make a similar powder here? We should acquire the
scientific knowledge and make it locally so that powder milk could be
available even at the top of the Himalayas.
Jamnalal’s health is not so good that he can be allowed to go to
jail again. If he falls ill after going there I shall not be able to bear it.
This struggle is going to be a prolonged one. When the time comes I
shall myself ask him to leave everything and go to jail. But today it is
my duty not to send him to jail. What should be his field of activity
then? He placed before me a few suggestions such as Harijan [work],
khadi, cow-protection, etc. Of them I liked cow-protection. He was
associated with this work from its inception and whatever work has so
far been done has not been wasted. It was by and large being conducted
according to my own understanding and advice. Now it will be run
under Jamnalalji’s guidance.
Cow-protection is service to the dumb creation. Today Harijans
are weak but tomorrow they can become strong and make progress on
1 Milk boiled to solid formVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 141their own, for they possess all the human faculties. If tomorrow Harijans
rise and take possession of temples, I shall dance [for joy]. But the cow
has no such strength. She can be strong and healthy only if we feed her.
She will always be a docile animal. You may hit or even kill her, but she
cannot revolt against you. Who is then going to protect her? Jamnalal’s
spiritual craving will be satisfied by serving the cow. I have, therefore,
entrusted this work entirely to him and he will run it with his business
instinct as well as his altruistic disposition.
Cow-protection is a stupendous task. We will have to study this
science in a dispassionate manner. We must bring together all those who
have studied this subject from the modern scientific angle. We should
have a band of efficient gosevaks who can go where demanded. If
Swami Ananda wishes to come he may, though he can carry on the
work in Thana itself. He should decide about the area of his activity and
concentrate his energy there. In this way, let us take the map of India
and divide it into ten or hundred divisions. The person in charge of
each division will send in his report. There are a number of goshalas in
India which should be inspected and run on proper lines. If an expert is
required anywhere we should be in a position to send one.
It requires a man of purity to become a servant of the cow. A
person of ability alone will not do. I see no need of touring at present
for this work. It should be possible to do a lot of work while stationed at
one place. To begin with, from now on we can supply cow’s milk in
Wardha itself to those who are prepared to use it.

270. MESSAGE TO STATES’ PEOPLE
October 1, 1941
I hold strong and decided views on the relationship between the
Princes and the people. I am convinced that, in the new world order,
which is bound to follow the insensate butchery, dignified by the name
of war, the Princes will have place only if they become true servants ofVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 145the people, deriving their power not from the sword but from the love
and consent of the people.
Such being my fixed view, I advise the people of the States to
cultivate patience and prepare themselves for the responsibilities that will
devolve on them, willy-nilly, by assiduously doing mute constructive
work.
This does not mean submission to active and acute tyranny, of
which I have so many accounts coming to me. This the victims must
resist in the best manner they can. The only best manner I know is the
way of non-violence, otherwise called conscious and deliberate
self-suffering. But cases of individual torture and degradation have
come under my notice. If they are true and if the tortured persons do
not know the way of non-violence, they will resist the tortures with all
the violence they can summon from within and die in the attempt to
resist the torture and the degradation. That violent resistance will almost
count as non-violence, even as the resistance of a mouse to a ferocious
cat will count. I have in mind an unarmed man under torture by an
armed company of torturers. No man, however weak in body, if he has
the will to resist and the capacity to die bravely, need feel helpless
against odds, however heavy.
I would like the Princes to accept my claims to be their true
friend. As such, I would like to tell them that the way to read the signs
of the times is to realize the utter helplessness of the sword. The Biblical
saying is going to prove true sooner than we had expected: “For all
they that take the sword shall perish by the sword.”

However mean or insignificant the work may be, God values it
more, provided it is done for service and without any hope of return.
Thus sweepers’ work is more valuable if it is done selflessly and with the
motive of serving.
Gandhiji appealed to the audience to help in cow-protection work, in
preserving the cow which was now perishing due to neglect. The evil, if not checked,
would, he said, result in serious deterioration of the agricultural wealth of the country.
In conclusion, he appealed to them to develop charkha and spinning.
I do not value my Jayanti Day, but I call it ‘Charkha Jayanti’.
Gandhiji told the villagers that he would come every night amongst them for
prayer, provided they liked it, as this would establish increased contact with them, but
they must be punctual and regular.1

SEVAGRAM ,
October 3, 1941
It is no pleasure for me to appear before this court for the third
time except the natural pleasure one derives from the performance of
one’s duty. But for the peremptory call of duty I should not have
reappeared before this court.
Deep meditation for which jail life provides an ample opportunity
has convinced me more than ever of the correctness of the Congress
resolution to offer civil disobedience in vindication of the right of free
speech to the extent of inviting those who listen to oppose the war in
every shape or form.
The rivers of blood that are daily flowing in this war which is
without parallel in barbarity and ferocity should convince even the
confirmed sceptic of the utter immorality of the war. Except for
hypnotism which hardens even the sense of perception, there should not
be any difficulty in preceiving the crime against humanity which the
present war means.
It is difficult to strike the balance between the right and the
wrong. The right can only belong to the party that washes its hands
clean of blood-guiltiness and dares the aggressor by accepting the law
of self–suffering through non-violent action to do his worst.
Though seemingly the Congress fight is in defence of the right to
preach against association with all wars or at least this war, it is none the
less an effort to convince the world of the immeasurable superiority of
non-violent action over the violent resistance even in a cause considered
just.
Let no one attribute ineffectiveness to the studied mildness of the
Congress action. Actions appearing insignificant have led before now to
astounding results. Those of us who are privileged to take part in the
struggle have a living faith that our civil disobedience will lead to a
result fraught with the greatest benefit to mankind.

MY DEAR IDIOT,
Yours. I repeat that you should accept the nomination.
I have already told you, my touring is uncertain. I agree that if
you are not completely restored or otherwise, too, if you feel the
benefits of Simla climate, you should stay away during my absence.
Indeed if you feel the benefit, you should prolong your stay till you are
completely restored.

this afternoon. Madalasa gave birth to a son. All are happy.

Again the pain. I suppose it will come and go till at last it is itself
exhausted in the effort, if we do not feed it. That is nature’s way. And
you are following it, I am sure. No fried chips or anything of the sort.
You did not tell me about this exposition of the Bible. But having

October 4, 1941
BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
We shall meet soon now. However, I wish to write about one thing.
Manibehn writes and tells me that . . .1 will appear for mill-owners in a
case against workers. I cannot believe this. But how can Mani make such
a mistake? At first, therefore, I thought of writing to. . . .2 On second
thoughts, however, I feel that there was no need for me to write while
you were there. You yourself can solve the problem. If Mani is right,
send for . . .3 and tell him that, if at all, he should appear on behalf of
the workers. He cannot appear on behalf of the mill-owners under any
circumstances. The other point is that, so far as I understand, . . . .4 was
not to resume practice. He has dedicated himself to national service. He
may accept a brief in special circumstances. But if he starts practice like
any other lawyer, his conduct would deserve the severest condemnation.
I am quite clear in my mind that he was not to resume practice. He has
left the Congress in order to clarify his position from a moral point of
view. But in all other respects he is a Congressman. I had thought that
by leaving the Congress he had, like me, become more of a
Congressman. He seemed frank and straightforward to me, is capable of
responding to an appeal to the heart and of self-sacrifice, and is a man
ready to correct his error. If you share this impression, send for him and
explain this to him. We should treat him as a Congressman for all
practical purposes.
I suppose you know that Maulana wants . . . to leave the
Assembly. I see no such need. Rajendra Babu does not see any, nor
does the Professor. I think you also do not see any. Am I right? Or do I
stand corrected?

 302. LETTER TO MIRZA ISMAIL
October 5, 1941
DEAR SIR MIRZA,
I have your letter of 28th ultimo. I had your previous letter too. I
thank you for both.
The copy of Polak’s letter is important. He has developed of late a
strange attitude on Indian affairs. It is not less unfortunate because it is
sincerely held. What he considers unreal is altogether real for us.
Pakistan may be unreal. I hold it to be dangerous. But it is too real to be
dismissed with contempt. C[ivil] D[isobedience] may be unreal. But I
should resent anybody calling it unreal. Sir Tej Bahadur’s wrath is not
unreal. It is symptomatic of the Indian temper. I know nobody who
considers this war to be India’s war. The utter disregard of the sentiment
of politically-minded India is a dangerous reality.
I can heartily share Polak’s hope that you may be used by God160 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfor bringing peace between the two communities. Polak has forgotten
what he knew before as well as I do, that the Princes are not free agents.
They have no will but the British will, they have no status but what the
British may give them from moment to moment. To say that we must
produce an agreement to which the Princes are party is as much as to
say that the British should be party.
You may send this to Polak, if you think it will serve any useful
purpose. I have simply given you my reaction to Polak’s, if only in
appreciation of your considerateness in sending me the copy.
I hope you have no difficulty in deciphering my writing.
With regards to you and the family.

314. LETTER TO CHAKRAYYA
October 6, 1941
CHI. CHAKRAYYA,
It is sad that you had an attack of giddiness. I think it was due to
the weight on your mind. So it is good that you wrote everything. But
there is no reason to be sorry about it.
The complaint about partiality is correct. None else is at fault
except Ba and myself. Ba has not been able to give up [the feeling of]
‘mine’ and ‘thine’, and I cannot leave Ba. Hence the progress of the
Ashram has stopped. But there are many good qualities in Ba, which I
cannot forget. It is difficult to free oneself from ‘mine’ and ‘thine’.
But the change that has taken place in Ba’s life is no small thing. From
where did Ba attain such purity? Her simplicity, patience, etc., are
qualities of a high order. Hencc Ba’s partiality deserves to be tolerated.
There is no venom in her partiality.
You have been unfair to Krishnachandra and Shakaribehn.
Krishnachandra does nothing for his own sake. He gave up his home,
his studies, and he labours in the Ashram. If he tried to save five annas,
it was not for himself. He will not be partial to anyone. lt is a different
matter if he is frightened and is exploited by someone. So it is with
Shakaribehn. If I relieve her from work, she would stay away, and also
like it. She is like that. You should understand that all of us in the
Ashram are imperfect; even then we try to be good. Your duty is to look
at your own faults and be tolerant of others’. This rule is for us all. You166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhave seen the figure of three monkeys on my desk, haven’t you? One
monkey has closed his ears, another his eyes and the third one his
mouth. The suggestion is, hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. I hope
you would be satisfied with this. Read this letter again and again. Get
well soon.

I have your letter and the cheque through Prithvi Singh. Why is
the cheque of the Travancore bank ? Does it give [a higher] interest or
provide more facilities ? Where can that cheque be encashed ? It must
be charging a handsome commission. I shall of course make inquiries.
Can you accommodate both the sisters ? How is it your studies get
constantly interrupted ? I shall not let you sit for the examination if you
are not fully prepared. There should be no question which you cannot
answer. If you cannot be so well prepared by April, then you may sit for
the examination later. I am not in a hurry. The knowledge you have
gained is not going to be wasted, and so, if it takes some more time, so
be it. Because, I also do not wish that you should spoil your eyes and
health by continuously reading night and day in order to pass. Passing
in this way is no better than failing. You have to appear for the
examination not for name but for service.
How much khadi did you sell and where did you sell it ?
The Ashram is now becoming very crowded. Vijaya and
Vasumati have come. Pannalal has come. Some others will be arriving.
More people are eager to come. How can I accommodate them ? Just
think of the size of the kitchen and of the verandah, which is the dining
place. Construction work is of course going on. There is nosaying when
it will end. Nor can I fix a time for it. Let God do as He wills.

When Mithila was burning, King Janaka was not perturbed in the least.
Why should we lag behind Janaka ? Why should we not outdo him ?
How that can be done, God alone knows. But he has shown us that we
should be like him.
Taramati must be happy. There is a telegram from Harkisan. But
I am not writing to him separately. He has done creditable work as your
nephew. Because you gave me detailed information at once, I also
caused a stir.

3 Samuel StokesVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 169320. SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING
WARDHA,
October 7, 1941
Today I must speak on one or two fundamental questions. You
must all have read Pandit Jawaharlal’s letter in Khadi Jagat.
Jawaharlal’s language generally tends to be strong. But I feel that this is
a good letter. We must pay attention to its purport. He is discontented.
He asks why we have not been able to do more work. He feels we have
not given enough consideration to the matter. I would not entirely
agree. We have been giving consideration to the matter from time to
time and even today we are seized of it. But I must admit our sadhana,
our tapasya, has not been adequate. This is the point made by
Jawaharlal. His very name evokes thoughts of awakening and
inspiration. Jawaharlal has always recognized the importance of khadi
but after he went to jail he has come to feel more acutely on the subject.
We must give due thought to his letter.
The news coming in from all sides shows that the demand for
khadi has sharply increased. It has risen so much that we are not in a
position to meet it. The demand for charkhas too is so great that we can
never cope with it! What can we do? In many places, the money value of
the work, which was a few hundred rupees, is now a few thousand
rupees. You may have heard that in Ranchi, Bihar, while the sale of
khadi at the last Jayanti was of the order of Rs. 600, it has now risen to
Rs. 10,000. What I say is that we must go on producing as much khadi
as we can. We should not let ourselves be deterred by the fear that it
might not be sold. We must never allow ourselves to think for a moment
that khadi cannot be sold. Yes, we may not have enough capital to
substantially increase the production of khadi. In that case we should try
to find the capital.
We must carefully consider what should be our technique of work.
Someone has written saying that a lot of yarn has piled up with him and
asked how he is to get it woven. We must have the resources to have
such yarn woven or exchanged for khadi. We must be able to accept all
the yarn that comes and supply in exchange such khadi in such
quantities as we can.
We must also so improve the quality of our yarn that even the least
efficient weavers may be able to weave it. It is said that we cannot spin
any yarn of the strength of mill yarn. This is to some extent true. But
this  does  not satisfy me.  May be  we  cannot  compete  with mills in
the quality of the yarn. Even so the difference should not be too great170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIand it should gradually diminish. Today our yarn leaves much room for
improvement. We have not made the progress that is desired in this
field. There is much work that we have to do. We must discover and
show to the people ways of producing good and strong yarn. A lot of
research into the subject is needed. We have not paid sufficient attention
to the matter. We have been slack.
We must decentralize our work. Yarn should be woven where it is
spun. We have been able to do so much since middle-class people took
to spinning Now if they will also take up weaving we can rally the
weavers round us and take them forward. We should make efforts in this
direction also.
 The demand for charkhas is on the increase everywhere. This too
shows that more and more people are taking to spinning. For myself I
have decided that we cannot send charkhas to every place from outside.
They should be manufactured locally. I am beginning to think that
dhanush takli alone can solve the problem. It can be made everywhere.
The Yeravda charkha has its place and it will remain. But it cannot be
made everywhere. It would be well if we could provide taklis to the
millions. But the plying of the takli calls for devoting special time,
labour and attention. It is also possible we may not be able to produce
yarn in sufficient quantities on the takli. It is not that with the dhanush
takli as much yarn can be produced as with any other charkha. It is easy
to ply and easy to make. It can be made even without the aid of a
carpenter. The making of the spindle for it may present some difficulty
but not much. For even if a spindle is a little crooked, it can serve in a
dhanush takli. We can make millions of dhanush taklis in a day. I admit
I will have a little difficulty in the beginning in making people
interested in it even as I had in making them interested in khadi but it
will soon be overcome. We have to put a spur to the work of attaining
self-reliance in khadi. This can be done only through the dhanush takli.
I cannot agree with the suggestion that charkhas should be
manufactured in a few factories and then sent out to every place from
there. If we thus centralize the charkha it will be finished. Everything
connected with the charkha should be made where the spinning is done.
That is why I have suggested that every home should have a dhanush
takli in it. Till we have fully gone into the thing we should not indulge
in a mere intellectual discussion of the problem. Only he has a right to
participate in any discussion on the matter who has plied a dhanush
takli  for  nine  hours  every  day  for a month.  He will  have  a  right
to  express  a  view.  I  therefore  suggest  that you  should  give
thought to the dhanush takli. But  not  merely  because I am advocating
it. If your experience refutes my point you should not go merely byVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 171what I say. I had spoken of giving spinners a daily wage of eight annas
but so far we have not been able to go beyond three annas. Supposing
we were to have the same experience here? This is a matter for research
and experiment.
In the same way we have to think about the yarn. We should think
of developing the capacity to weave whatever yarn may come to us. We
must in any case accept the self-sufficient yarn. The people who bring
the yarn should accept the price we can give for it. Whether it is in the
form of money or khadi we must not refuse to pay. If we cannot
arrange for yarn thus received to be woven, then we may say in
Jawaharlal’s words that our creative faculties have become atrophied—
we have lost our ability to think. This would be a defeatist attitude. We
do not want to accept defeat.
If we cannot take the weavers in our fold nothing will get done.
But we cannot go by mere faith. Today they are using mill yarn. We
have to change this situation. We have to give them handspun yarn. My
feeling is that the War is not going to end soon. No import of cloth will
he possible. Prices of textiles will also rise. Only Indian mills will be
manufacturing cloth for use in India. A time may come when they will
not be able to supply all our requirement. Cloth in India will then
become scarce. In China too such a situation had arisen. But the Chinese
are a hard-working people. They started the charkha in every home and
in their own way quickly solved the problem. Our method will be a little
different but the effort required will be as much or more. A day may
come when people will ask us for cloth. It would be a disgrace to tell
them that we could not supply it.
We shall also have to think about cotton. It is my firm conviction
that if we produce cotton in the manner it should be from the point of
view of khadi we shall soon be free of the need for imports. If we
produce cotton to feed the mills this will not be possible. I feel that the
principle of producing cotton for mills is opposed to the principle of
producing it for khadi. The convenience of the mills requires that
cotton should be intensively grown in a few areas. Their aim will be to
see that if cotton-growing is too scattered it should be brought together
and concentrated in one place. But khadi requires that cotton should be
grown in every village. No village should have to depend on another
village for its cotton requirement. Khadi cannot afford transport of
cotton from one village to another. We must immediately pay attention
to the question how we can make cotton row in every village.
Another  matter has  been  placed before me for my consi-
deration.  Many of our khadi bhandars are very small. The question is172 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwhether in the interest of economy it will not be better that each such
bhandar should be looked after by no more than one person. What we
will have to consider in this connection is whether these bhandars are to
remain open for a fixed time or as long as possible.
If we want to make our lives khadi-based we shall have to devise
certain rules as regards khadi bhandars. The rules will be different for
towns and villages. For the towns I think we should follow the practice
of English shopkeepers. They open shops according to their
convenience. They keep them closed on Sundays. They don’t care
about the customers. Gradually the customers become used to it. We
also want to establish new habits. We should also make certain rules and
fix a time for the opening of shops. The same consideration should
apply to shops in rural areas. In South Africa there is one shop for an
area of thousands of bighas. People come in mule-carts to make their
purchases. Sometimes the shopkeeper is not there, since there only one
person to look after the shop. But people are used to it. Similarly, it is
not necessary for us to keep our bhandars open all the time. But the
matter needs to be considered.
Thus we shall have to give systematic thought to all these matters.
We want to make of khadi an integrated way of life. We have to deal
with artisans, spinners and weavers. In the sphere of production our aim
is to pay equal wages to all. So far we have extorted forced labour from
the spinners. This doctrine of paying the lowest wage and taking
maximum work for it has been taken from the Arthashastra of Kautilya.
We must change this doctrine for a new one. We shall give the same
wage to spinners as we give to weavers. Those who produce cotton
should also prosper. And yet we want that the burden on the buyer
should be light. Thus we wish to create a socialist society. The socialism
that India can digest will be of this kind. It will be the socialism of the
poor, but of the well-to-do poor. The ideal of khadi is thus the
promotion of a wholly socialistic way of life.
In brief, we have to give thought to all the processes of khadi—
from the growing of cotton to the selling of cloth. When we have thus
succeeded in bringing about a self-sufficient socialist polity we shall no
more be at the mercy of foreign markets. Our society will be like a
self-sufficient agriculturist. To an agriculturist his land is his capital. He
eats what the land yields. If some year there is a failure of crops he
starves. He does not beg and he does not plunder.
That  is  all  I had to say. We must pay special attention toVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 173weaving. I have always said that just as we insisted that we should be
good carders we should also insist that we should become good weavers.

BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
I understand your letter. It is very necessary to see . . .1. I am
certainly going to pursue the matter. I do not wish to involve you in the
problem of Bhulabhai. I will do what I can about him.
Raja is not in a position to come at present. Two well educated
sons of his brother died only recently. There are two or three sick-beds
in his own family. He will, therefore, go first to Bangalore. He will spend
a few days there. He must have informed you, too. I also do not wish
that you should have to come here twice. You may, therefore, come over
when Raja and others are coming. Satyamurti of course is coming on
the l0th. Kamaladevi is arriving tomorrow. Prakasam2 is certain to come.
Asaf Ali is coming after meeting Jawaharlal and Maulana, and so we
shall be having a good crowd. I shall be able to manage.
Your duty is to get well.
The Ashram is being practically raided these days. We continue to
receive pressing requests from people. I refuse most of them. Where is
the space? New buildings are continually coming up, but even then the
Ashram is always crowded.

MY DEAR IDIOT,
Again I follow the new rule of writing during the silence hour.
 So your cough is persistent. Poor Shummy. I am almost sure that the
cough is due to some error in diet. Some grease, more starch, sour fruit,
sloppy food, too much protein, both animal and vegetable, dal, spices
ever so little, general indigestion. These are the causes according to my
belief. Menkel’s manipulations are local. They can never bring
permanent cure unless your digestive apparatus is in order.
There is no moving out for me during this month. Almost all
dates are booked. If Rajaji comes about 20th, it means four or five
days’ conversations.
Additions to the cottage are substantial and expensive.

CHI. SUSHILA,
I have your letter. You are filled with anxiety about your studies.
Content yourself with as much as you can do. Your aim is not to pass an
examination but to enhance your knowledge. Of course you have to
appear for the examination but that should be when you feel fully
confident. Do not worry about the delay. Let it take as long as it may.
Pyarelal had spoken to me about the idea of your staying in
Lahore. I had told him that I would keep myself ready to make the
arrangements later. I forgot to write to you about the matter. I can make
arrangements quickly if you will allow me to do so.
Kanu having  left,  A.S.  is doing the massage. Dhiren has his
class  at 8, so  A. S.  has to do it. You should take it that all talk about
my taking service from you has now ceased. Of course, I want you to
1 Vide “Letter to Chakrayya”, 6-10-1941176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIrise above all such talk. Why should it affect us whether somebody
praises us or blames us ?
My teaching was only with regard to the duty of a satyagrahi. A
satyagrahi will not court imprisonment to forget his pain or to escape
from it. He will do so in the faith that to offer satyagraha is his duty.
As for A. S., I would only say that one should forget about her.
One should accept whatever services she offers, but not expect anything
from her.
It seems Pyarelal’s statement has been well received. It is brief but
to the point.
Do not worry about my weight. Increasing it only gradually may
be the best thing. I have again increased the quota of butter.

DEAR MAHMUD,

What you say about unity I can heartily endorse. But fancy

merchant, should 1 refuse Government order for wheat for the army, or
quinine, if I was a chemist? Supposing I refused and somebody else
bought from me and sold it to the Government, how do I get out of the
responsibility? War effort is made of sterner stuff. If you do not
understand this elementary proposition, you will when an attempt is
made to impress my personal service or to impress my labour to
manufacture ammunition. You will then realize the fundamental
distinction, if I have the courage to refuse obedience. You must think
hard and try to understand or not rest till I convert you  or you, me.
About Sind, you must see the Maulana and reason with him. I am
wholly with you there. Are you well?

permission for herself and Father-in-law to come and pass a few days at

Why has Usha fallen ill? If you avoid giving milk or soup while
the fever is rising, it comes down quicker. Here, this is how the
treatment of all fever starts. It applies to everybody, young and old.
Fever causes no fear. Giving enema does become necessary. The
patient must be given as much water as possible. Hot water would be
better. Salt and soda can be added to it. Lime juice can also be added.
If Kanu really wants to come, send him. Or, bring him at Diwali time
if he can make it. I think Ramdas too will be having holidays !

Your letter. You have done quite well. I have written to
Dhirendra1 . You must not incur expenditure in sending the yarn to
me. It may as well be kept there. It will certainly be woven if it comes.
I will of course use the khadi made out of the yarn sent by you. A
shawl is being made out of it. After using it for a while I shall give it
to Kakasaheb2 for sending it to Kashi. I have gone through your
poem. Please convey my blessings to all and say that the more heart
they put into spinning the nearer swaraj is bound to be. Never without
it.

348. SPEECH AT SEVAGRAM
October 12, 1941
 I did not know that such a big crowd would collect here. It is
good that it has. It is an auspicious augury that two crore eighty
thousand yards of yarn and Rs. 12,000 have been collected from the
1 Dhirendra Majumdar, who was the addressee’s fellow-prisoner in Agra Jail
2 D. B. KalelkarVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 187three divisions1 of Central Provinces.
I have received two letters from Agra Jail also. The prisoners
there have spun a good deal of yarn. They did not have all the
facilities for spinning. But after Dhirendra Majumdar had reached the
Jail, how could he rest content without making everyone spin? He is
one of the pillars of the Charkha Sangh. He was not expected to go to
jail. But the Government sometimes becomes over-generous. It picks
up some people without any ostensible reason.
Shri Maithilisharanji is also there. He too was arrested without
any good reason. He is a famous poet and he has sent me a poem
also. But today poetry does not flow from his pen; it flows from the
yarn that he spins. I have sent him today a short reply2. In that letter,
too, I have said that with every round of yarn he and his co-prisoners
have spun, they have brought swaraj so much the nearer.
What I wrote to the poet is not mere rhetoric. I mean what I say.
According to my definition, there cannot be true swaraj as long as
there is exploitation. Mere change from British to Indian rule does not
mean swaraj. As long as one class dominates over another, as long as
the poor remain poor or become poorer, there will be no swaraj. In
my swaraj the millions will live happily. They will get good food,
decent house and enough clothing. By good food I do not mean that
they will eat sweets. But everyone must get pure milk, pure ghee and
sufficient fruit and vegetables. I know I am talking tall because the
poor today do not even know what fruit is. During the mango season,
they get a few mangoes and during the guava season they have a few
guavas. They do not get any other fruit except these and a few other.
They do not get even clean and nutritious foodgrain. They have to
live on rotten rice, coarse grain and dirty salt. I wish everyone gets
what they call a balanced diet as also a clean and comfortable house.
This according to me is real freedom. I have written those words to
Maithilisharanji with this kind of freedom in view.
We have never produced as much yarn as we have produced this
year. The reports that I get from the prisons make me dance for joy.
Maithilisharanji writes to me that in the Agra Jail his Communist
companions also join in spinning although they have no respect for
my views. No one compelled them. They started spinning on their
own. This is the way of ahimsa.
1 Nagpur, Berar and Mahakoshal
2 Vide the preceding item.188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII have also received reports from the Gujrat (Punjab) jail. I am
not suggesting that everyone spins. I have the names of those too who
are not spinning. But those who spin are in a majority. I become more
hopeful when I see these facts. I am an irrepressible optimist. But even
I did not entertain such high hopes. The Congress Constitution does
include the rule about khadi but till now the Congress Committee
insisted on khadi only to conform to the rule. On this occasion, I
believe, the work has been done with an element of faith.
While I say all this, I am not so foolish as to believe that khadi is
now on its feet. Whatever has been achieved is sufficient to strengthen
my hope and my faith. But that is not enough for the growth of
khadi. These are good omens. But they are not sufficient for the
removal of poverty and unemployment. These problems cannot be
solved as long as crores of people do not wear khadi. I have a dream
that people will wear home-spun khadi just as they eat home-made
food.
I am talking of these things because people continue to ask me
one question. Even today I have received a letter. They all ask, ‘What
will be the outcome of this struggle? It is very slow and has no effect
on the Government. The Government does not seem to care. A large
number of satyagrahis are wandering in the streets. They are not even
arrested. How can such a struggle be effective?’
They may say what they like, but my feeling is that my fight is
going on according to my plan. I am satisfied with its momentum. At
present I do not want to increase it further. This does not mean that it
will never gain momentum. When the occasion demands it will be
accelerated. But this is not the occasion for it. Everything is good or
bad in a particular context. There are occasions when mere bread is
very useful. But when it is inopportune even jalebi1 is harmful. So
when an opportune time comes, our fight will be intensified.
Some people expect a miracle this very day. In ahimsa there is
no scope for such sudden miracles. Ahimsa does not admit of sudden
spurts. But those who will can always see the miracles of ahimsa. We
watch the sky every day but we see no miracles there. But those who
have an eye for it are spellbound by the spectacle. They see new
miracles every moment. And the sky is only a small fragment of
Divine Power. That Divine Power is also the source of ahimsa which
1 A sweetmeatVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 189works according to the Divine Law. That Law is so mysterious that
even its miraculous effects do not appear to be such. They look like a
natural course of events. Our non-violent struggle will also evolve
according to the same Law. When independence comes through non-
violence it will blossom forth so naturally that we may never notice the
miracle having taken place.
Some people say that this is the opportunity to pressurize the
Government. From this point of view, they say, my present struggle of
ahimsa is entirely lifeless. I want to point out to them that the contents
of the Bombay Resolution1 are not mere prattle nor were they
intended to bluff the world. The Congress is a responsible trustworthy
organization. Its resolutions are serious, sincere and without
exaggeration. The Bombay Resolution pins its faith on the policy of
non-violence. It has a passage2 which should keep Congressmen
always alert and watchful.
When the policy of non-violence has been so clearly stated in
the Bombay Resolution, how can we say that England’s difficulty is
our greatest opportunity? How can the Congress say that we should
give her one more blow when England is herself collapsing? And who
knows whether England is actually collapsing? Outwardly of course it
looks like that. But I do not believe it. Appearances are not always
real. During the Boer War also there was an occasion when it appeared
that England was almost defeated but the situation took a sudden turn
and she came out victorious.
Today also we do not know who is going to win. We do not want
any one party to be defeated. We wish that all the warring parties
should come to terms and live like brothers. How can you expect me
to say that either Germany or Russia or Britain and America should be
defeated? I would pray that no one is defeated and they all live like
brothers.
Ahimsa dictates : ‘Consider no one your enemy. Love even him
who considers you his enemy.’ How can we then think of taking
advantage of England’s predicament?
You may say, ‘Then we are sure to be destroyed. We will suffer
defeat at the hands of the British.’ This betrays lack of faith. A
1 Vide “To Satyagrahis”, 2-10-1940.
2  Which reads : “They can have no ill will against them (the Britishers), and
the spirit of satyagraha forbids the Congress from doing anything with a view to
embarass them.”190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfollower of non-violence suffers defeat at no one’s hands. I may
repeat once again that ‘defeat’ has no place in the dictionary of
ahimsa. Victory and defeat are the results of violent war. In ahimsa
there is only victory and nothing else. At the moment I cannot tell
you how our ahimsa is ultimately going to succeed.
Not to embarrass Britain does not mean that we should help
them. They are resorting to violent methods. We have to stand firm on
our principle of ahimsa. This will no doubt create some difficulty for
them. But we cannot help it. How can we give up a principle which is
bound to lead to the welfare of the world including that of Britain?
But if we violate our principle, we shall be guilty of violence. I wish
you to keep this in mind.
People ask me, ‘What will be the outcome of this satyagraha?
All types of people, good, bad and indifferent, have joined it. Even
cheats and rogues are courting arrest in the name of satyagraha.’ I
know there is not a single province where undesirable men have not
courted arrest. But I also know that there is not a single province
where people who measure up to my standards have not gone to jail.
That is why I have not launched a mass movement. If I launch a mass
movement, people may perhaps jump into it. What will the British do
in that case? They will enact another Jallianwala Bagh. I am not afraid
of it, but I do not want to give them an opportunity to do so. If we
remain strictly non-violent and then they force a Jallianwala upon us, I
could not care less.
But I say once again that it will be a good omen for India if
even a handful of men whom we know to be true remain steadfast to
their pledge. That will pave the way for an all-out non-violent
struggle.
All this needs an element of honesty. It is a primary condition.
Those Congressmen who have to faith in khadi, who decry
untouchability in public but observe it in their homes, who, being
Hindus, hate the Muslims, or who, being Muslims, hate the non-
Muslims, do not deserve to be satyagrahis. Such persons cannot help
our cause even by going to jail. They are like thieves and dacoits who
also go to jail. They are not satyagrahis but only law-breakers. They
cannot produce any wholesome results. Why should they go to jail
disrupting their homes and forgoing their income? We wish that only
a handful of satyagrahis should go to jail; but their conduct should be
such as to produce a moral effect.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 191Civil disobedience is a powerful weapon. But for employing it,
we must fulfil the thirteen-point constructive programme1 which I
have outlined. Till then this weapon cannot be effective. I know that
the crores of people in India cannot court arrest. Nor is that necessary.
But it is essential that crores of people should have faith in the
constructive programme. Khadi is the pivot of the constructive
programme. It is essential that crores of people should wear khadi;
they should not wear foreign or mill-made cloth and they should not
observe any untouchability. If they are not prepared to do even this,
how can freedom be won through ahimsa? What right do they have to
desire freedom, who are not prepared to take even a little trouble?
If we wish to win swaraj through ahimsa, this is the only way. If,
however, we wish to use force, then Hitler would point the way. There
are only two courses open—either Hitler’s, that is, the way of violence,
or mine, that is, the way of non-violence. Hitlerism and Churchillism
are in fact the same thing. The difference of only one of degree.
By presenting this yarn and this money to me, you are telling
me that you do not want to tread the path of violence. It is my belief
that a time will come when everyone in India will realize that the only
correct course is to follow ahimsa. The day is soon arriving for khadi
when the entire country will be convinced that any cloth other than
khadi must be discarded. I shall utilize all the money I have received
on the occasion of Khadi Jayanti for encouraging khadi. People ask
me, ‘Why do you not ulitize this money for Congress work?’ In a way
khadi work is also Congress work. But it is only the parliamentary
programme or the movement against the Government that people
regard as Congress work. This is a wrong notion. This amount will be
utilized only for khadi work.
It is to be considered how this money received from the three
divisions of the Central Provinces is to be utilized for the purposes of
khadi. These three divisions may jointly or separately send schemes
for their areas. Jajuji2 will welcome and give them due consideration.
If we do not accept these schemes, we shall give reasons for rejecting
them.
Many people send yarn to me by post. I do not understand why
they do so. The amount spent on postage is more than the value of the
1 Vide “Implications of Constructive Program”, 13-8-1940
2 Shrikrishnadas Jaju192 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIyarn. I wish people would send me ready-made khadi. Even from the
jail they should send khadi woven out of yarn spun by them. Today
people ply the charkha. But I wish that they learn operating the
handloom. They should send me woven khadi. I do not need khadi
for myself. I have enough khadi for my personl use. Hence it would
be all right if people weave khadi and send it to the Charkha Sangh of
their own Province, though, from one point of view, it is better to sent
it to me so that I may know how the work is progressing from year to
year both in quantity as well as in quality. As years pass the quality of
our yarn should improve. But they should not pay railway freight in
sending the yarn to me. Only khadi should reach me. It would be
enough if just a specimen is sent to me.
All of us should devote greater energy and talent to khadi work.
This can be done even in jail.
Those who have been to prison once have to go there again and
again. There is no question of going back. It does not mean that we
shall do so indiscriminately. We shall have to use our discretion. How
can we send to prison again a person whose health has been shattered
during imprisonment in spite of the best efforts? It will be a kind of
violence.
Some people ask me : ‘Why should the same persons go to jail
again and again? Why not select new men so that the satyagraha
continues without causing much strain?’ I have already said that a
non-violent war has its own strategy. We cannot follow Hitlerian
tactics. A barbaric war is being fought in Europe with large-scale
massacres. Young, old, even invalids, are being annihilated. Even
barbaric war demands sacrifices. In a non-violent war there is no
scope for sacrifices on such a gigantic scale. Here we seek to employ
moral pressure. This will entail sacrifices on the part of a select few.
We have not been called upon to make any great sacrifices till now.
What are our sacrifices worth if we are not prepared to face even the
hardship of prison life time and again?
There is one other question. Should we carry on the struggle
within the four walls of the prison? Many problems arise there also.
The matter of A, B and C classes creates much bitterness. What should
we do there? These classes are a creation of Congressmen themselves.
I am convinced that these classes will ultimately be abolished. In the
mean time, there is much scope for improvement in the diet of C class
prisoners. I have already said that doctors can bring about the much-VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 193needed improvement in this matter if they so desire. But granting that
the doctors cannot do anything, even then this struggle will have to
continue. The satyagrahis will repeatedly go to prison. Prison life will
be full  of hardships. It will mean starvation and even if it causes death
in some cases I shall be prepared to face that eventuality. We should
all be ready for it.
We have simply on other course open to us. Our war demands
sacrifices, hardships and suffering. That is how the war of ahimsa is
waged.

October 13, 1941
DEAR DR. MOOKERJI,
I thank you for your letter.
Supposing Christians as such wanted to get rid of some social
abuse and established an association for dealing with it, I should think
they would restrict admission to fellow-Christians only. If you admit
this, you will appreciate the restriction in Harijan Sevak Sangh. Hindus
have sinned and they must purge themselves. The others can extend
their sympathy but cannot do repentance. Of course, there is
untouchability among Christians and Muslims, thanks to the highly
infectious disease in the Hindu body. Hindus can only help the latter
by completely curing themselves of the disease, but the rest has to be
dealt with by the respective communities.
The obvious is being missed because of the political results. But
the root of the evil is in the corruption of religion. If this is not clear,
you should pursue the subject, till at least we agree as to the results.
I hope your wife is well. Of course, you will come when you
can.

361. LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI
October 14, 1941
CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
Enclosed is a letter from Chimanlal. I have treated it as a pretext
for writing this letter. You must have received my previous letter.
I did not get Manilal’s letter after all. I have now given up hope
of receiving it.
Nilkanth1 and Surendra2 were here for a few days. Everybody
whom you know here is well.
Diwali is nearing, but there is no Diwali in my heart. I wonder if
you, too, have the right atmosphere for a Diwali there.
Your new High Commissioner is going to call on me. He writes
and tells me that he will remain completely neutral. I will write to you
after we have met. You will of course meet him at any rate as a matter
of courtesy. Invite him to Phoenix.

BHAI MAGANLAL,
Only now I could get time to read your letter of the 20th. I
cannot reach and deal with all letters in time. What can be the value of
my opinion now? I will state it, however. Let the friends take the
pledge if they wish. I have discovered from bitter experience that they
do not know the meaning of a pledge. Perhaps the best course would
be to remain in contact with them and be content with whatever they
do.

 364. LETTER TO SUSHILA NAYYAR
October 14, 1941
CHI. SUSHILA,
Yesterday I wrote the letter to you in the midst of a big crowd.
Today I am observing silence for an hour before mailing time and
taking the opportunity to write this letter.
Yesterday with great difficulty Prithvi Chand, Girdhari andVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 201Mahmud met Pyarelal. They had given no intimation beforehand.
Pyarelal was very happy. Prithvi Chand will give you a full account
when he comes. He has said that Sushila must not come to Sevagram
before her examination. Mother should not come to visit him if she is
not going to stay at Sevagram. He wants to meet Mahadev. The rest
through Prithvi Chand. I have come to the conclusion that Pyarelal
wishes that Mother should come here to stay. I have not yet met
Prithvi Chand. Girdhari mentioned the matter to me. Prithvi Chand
has gone to Wardha.
Prabhakar is very seriously ill. He is coughing very much. His
morning temperature is 99° and it goes up to 103° every day. Today a
homoeopath has come here and I have allowed him to take his
medicine.

MY DEAR IDIOT,
You are right. The extensions to the cottage are so elaborate that
there is every danger of our being crowded. The cosiness will be
gone. Let us see.
I have suggested full fortnight to test yourself. And otherwise
too this is no time for you to come. Nights are good but the days are
oppressive. So every way it is good you are not here.
Asaf Ali is in Wardha. He will be coming presently. So good-

CHI. MADALASA4,
As you are constantly in my thoughts, I dreamt about you
though I rarely dream. This letter is prompted by that dream. It
occurred three days ago, but it is only today that I got the time to
write.
Rearing a baby requires as much care as carrying it. The quality
of your milk will depend on your diet and your way of living. As the
food you eat will affect the quality of your milk, so also will your

4 Daughter of Jamnalal Bajaj, married to Shriman NarayanVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 203temper and your thoughts. Please take my word for this, for I am
writing it from personal observation. You should, therefore, make it a
point to eat food only as medicine, and not to please your palate. The
relish which one gets from this ‘medicine’ is true relish and is
nourishing. Do not understand the word ‘medicine’ in its strict
dictionary sense and be repelled by it. Milk can be taken both as
medicine and for the pleasure of the palate. The first way of taking it
will nourish the body and the second will harm it. The baby should
get proper exercise, fresh air, massage, etc. Do not listen to anybody
else in this matter. Many people will want to pamper the baby. But
whatever they might say, remain firm in your resolution.
This was the idea behind my dream. I hope you are in good
health and that the baby is growing well. I hope Mother and you do
not quarrel and that you do not cry. After you have left childbed you
should, I think, stay here for a month of so.

MY DEAR AMRITLAL,
I have your letter. From your previous letter I read a different
meaning from what I read in your letter. I have now asked Kanu8 to
go to you. His love for Abha9 is still there. But he realizes that he erred
and has therefore resigned himself to forfeiture of Abha’s hand. If
you and your wife wish and Abha is eager to marry Kanu, then and
then only should she come to me. If she comes you have to forget her
for the time being as you have Sailen10 and Dhiren11 till they have
finished their course and are on their way to earning their bread.
Abha will be trained here and will be sent to Rajkot too, if I pass her.
If both restrain themselves and Abha still likes Kanu and likes his
parents and surroundings and keeps her health, she will be married to
Kanu. So far as I can see both will have to wait for two years before

want is her welfare and [to] fit her for marriage. [If] you all and she

I see no harm in their selecting Nanabhai2 as President instead of
you. Accept whatever office they give and acquit yourself well. You
should learn the art of working in an organization. When you feel that
the work itself is suffering and conflicts are increasing, you may
resign in a spirit of humility. But you should not assume from the
beginning that the work is bound to suffer. It they give you the
financial functions or control, accept it. However, after duly thinking
over all this, do only what you think proper. I have faith in your
judgment.

BHAI GOHIL,
Received the letter signed by you and the other teachers. The
restrictions are imposed on teachers of Government schools mainly
with the object of preserving the authority of the Government. This I
think is sufficient reason for quitting Government service. But if you
want to continue in it, truthfulness lies in following Government rules
as long as the fetters are not removed as a result of the freedom
movement.
There must be regulations in non-governmental national
institutions also. Teachers should have a say in formulating them. It is
up to the teachers to continue or not to continue in the service of such
institutions. The propriety or impropriety of their regulations can be
judged only after scrutinizing them.

SEVAGRAM ,
October 20, 1941
BHAI JUGATRAM,
I have read both the books carefully. I think they would rank
high among the existing text-books. But I have not been able to
convince others of my view. You may remember the preface to my
efforts in this field. I had said that my attempt was not to add one
more book to the number of many good books. I wanted one book to
replace all the others  for  that  standard.  I stick   to my view even
now. But I see that it will not hold at the moment. If anyone from
among our teachers succeeds in such an enterprise, he may lead the
way. I want to prize open the minds of millions. I do believe they
must open up. Knowledge of the alphabet develops the intelligence
but little. Rather, it thwarts the development. And it costs a great deal,
as I do. From that angle these two books do not make the grade. The
illustrations are comparatively good but need much improvement.

CHI. SUSHILA,
Your cover was so heavy that it got torn and was sent in a
Government cover.
I have broken your rule quite a bit. Hence, I also observe
silence in the evening while keeping the eyes closed. I stop at exactly
8.30 at night. My health is of course good. If I do more work, the
blood-pressure rises. My weight went down by one 1b. yesterday. I
think it was due to the rush of work. I have been taking proper diet.

about Ratlam you may write to me. I have spoken to Munshiji. When
all the material is ready please let me know. The other cases are worth

WARDHAGANJ ,
October 21, 1941
The publication of the statement attributed to Shri Jayaprakash
Narayan, which he is stated to have attempted to smuggle from his
place of detention, does not, so far as I can see, lead us anywhere.1 If
the motive was to discredit the organization of which Jayaprakash
Narayan is a distinguished member, it must fail.
Assuming the correctness of the charge against Jayaprakash
Narayan, the method advocated by him is against the policy of truth
and non-violence adopted by the Congress, and he deserves the
severest condemnation. But it ill becomes the Government to
condemn or discredit it. Frankly, all nationalist forces, no matter by
what name they are described, are at war with the Government. And,
according to the accepted canons of war, the method adopted by
Jayaprakash Narayan is perfectly legitimate. He has had his training in
America for seven long years and is a student of the methods adopted
by Western nations in their fight for freedom. To practise deception,
to resort to secret methods and even to plot murder, are all honourable
and turn the perpetrators into national heroes. Are not Clive and
Warren Hastings British heroes? If Jayaprakash Narayan was in the
British Diplomatic Service and by secret diplomacy achieved
something of importance, he would be covered with distinction.
The sensation with which the event has been disclosed to the
Indian world is ill-conceived. The annotations in the communique are
probably wholly unwarranted. When it is borne in mind that
Jayaprakash Narayan is an untried detenu, the annotations look very
like hitting below the belt. The Government should have shown
Jayaprakash the document or documents seized, and published his
answer if he had any to give.
The way in which his poor wife has been dragged in is
unfortunate. She knew nothing of the attempt, for it was frustrated
1 A communique issued by the Government on October 16 said : “Plans to
consolidate the position of the Congress Socialist Party by winning over important
members of the terrorist organizations, known as the Revolutionary Socialist Party
and the Hindustan Republican Socialist Association and by isolating the Communist
Party, were seized from Mr. Jayaprakash Narayan, security prisoner, Deoli Camp,
when he attempted to pass them to his wife, Prabhavati Devi, at an interview.”220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIbefore anything could reach her. I may inform the public that
Prabhavati does not share Jayaprakash Narayan’s views. She was put
under my charge by her parents when she was not yet fifteen and
while her husband Jayaprakash was still in America. She has wholly
accepted my view of Indian politics and is one of my most faithful co-
workers. As husband and wife, Jayaprakash Narayan and Prabhavati
Devi are an ideal couple. Jayaprakash has never sought to impose his
views on Prabhavati. He has never prevented her from freely coming
to me. Indeed, he has encouraged her to come to me whenever she has
been ill. She has never been taken into the secrets of the Socialist
Party. The alleged communication has completely upset her, for she
never thought that her husband would advocate the method attributed
to him.
The suggestion made in some newspapers that the restrictions on
prisoners should be tightened is wholly irrelevant to Jayaprakash
Narayan’s attempt. That it was frustrated is enough proof of the
efficiency of the C. I. D. Even if there is laxity, it can be no warrant
for giving them bad or insufficient food, or keeping them in places
far away from their homes, making it difficult or expensive for
relatives to visit detenus. I have read Shri N. M. Joshi’s very careful
and over-moderate recommendations1 about the Deoli Camp. I have
learnt enough about it to enable me to say, in the name of humanity,
that the Camp should be disbanded and the prisoners should be sent
nearer their homes. It is wrong, from every point of view, to bring
prisoners from their provinces and concentrate them in a place where
there is no facility either of provisions or medical assistance or other
amenities of life. Prisoners of war are treated like princes compared to
political prisoners, whose status would be any day superior to that of
prisoners of war.
One word to Congressmen. While Jayaprakash Narayan remains
the patriot we have known him, they must realize that his method is
harmful in the extreme while a non-violent struggle is going on. I
have said, repeatedly, that secrecy has no place in a non-violent
organization. No underhand or underground movement can ever
become a mass movement or stir millions to mass action. I am glad,
therefore, that Shri Purshottam Tricumdas, Secretary of the Socialist
1 N. M. Joshi had, with the Government’s permission, visited Deoli in July
and published his impressions and suggestions.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 221Party, has repudiated the method said to be advocated by Jayaprakash
Narayan. Indeed, I would appeal to Jayaprakash Narayan to
reconsider his philosophy and, if his reason can approve, to repudiate
the method as a lapse from sound reason and the loyalty he owes to
the Congress. What he has stigmatized as a farce of satyagraha is not a
farce. It is the fine fruit of mature experience of thirty-three years’
experimenting in truth and non-violence; and, if God wills it, I hope to
demonstrate that from this farce will rise a reality which will compel
admission even by Jayaprakash Narayan and those who think with
him. Jayaprakash did not indeed go to prison as a satyagrahi,1 but he
has not ceased to be a member of the Congress, and so it is not proper
for him and others who think with him to retard the movement by
their action, which is admittedly disloyal to the Congress.

October 22, 1941
MY DEAR AGATHA,
I have kept by me your letter of 15th July. I did not know what
to say nor do I know now. I understand your earnestness and grief.
But I do not know how to console you. However detached you may
try to be, you cannot but be influenced by your surroundings. It is
equally true of me, not to talk of others. Add to this the difficulty of
answering in the middle of October a letter written in the middle of
July. And this when every day means new history. I have therefore the
greatest reluctance even to write to you in spite of the pleasure it gives
me to write to you. But I must try.
Distrust of the Rulers is growing and spreading. The distance is
increasing. We here perceive no difference between Hitlerism and
British Imperialism. Hitlerism is a superfine copy of Imperialism and
Imperialism is trying to overtake Hitlerism as fast as it can.
Democracy is nowhere. In this unholy duel, so far as I can see, non-
violence is working its way in a silent but sure manner. My fatih in it
is daily growing stronger. Whether as Polak says, and as you almost
hint,1 I think, in your most gentle manner, it can stand the strain if
bombs were dropping near my feet and I was witnessing dear ones
being crushed to death, I cannot say. I rehearse such situations, I pray
that the faith might not break under such strain. I flatter myself with
the belief that I can feel these things from afar. I did shed a silent tear
when I read about the damage done to the Houses of Parliament, the
Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s. Nevertheless this is all speculation.
If I fail in the examination, if it ever came to me, I shall have the
courage to admit my weakness but I will not deny my faith in non-
violence.
Of communal unity there is no immediate hope, though I
believe that it will come sooner than we expect. But that will bring no
settlement with the British Government. In their declarations there are
many impossible conditions. One is that we must get the Princes also
to agree. Now the Princes mean the British Government, for the
former are the latter’s creation and they cannot even talk openly with
1 The addressee explains : “I did not ‘hint’ that his non-violence could not
stand the strain of bombing, but asked him if sometimes ‘compromise of method—
not of aim’ could be considered.”224 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIanybody but by the latter’s consent.
The Rulers feel a sense of security in the existing situation. The
Princes obedient, the Muslim League showing its harmless teeth, and
the Congress led by me following its equally harmless Civil
Disobedience. They find no difficulty in squeezing the last pice and
getting as many recruits as they want.
Can you now have a glimpse of why you find endless
difficulties in the pursuit of your thankless task? But you must . . .1 It
is never wasted if it is sown in cultivable soil.
My own and hence the Congress method is incredibly simple.
Its token Civil Disobedience must continue. It will blaze forth when
the question of embarrassment disappears. The Congress is ready for
any honourable compromise with any party including the Rulers,
consistently with its fundamentals. Nothing short of Complete
Independence can be acceptable to the Congress. The Congress
cannot be party to the war efforts and therefore cannot take office.
But Civil Disobedience can be stopped if free speech consistently with
non-violence is recognized and all political prisoners are
unconditionally discharged. This excludes those who have been tried
and found guilty of actual violence unless they repent. It includes all
untried men. So far as I can see, the Congress will not change its
policy so long as I am alive and well enough to think clearly and
advise. There is no one who has any sympathy with Nazism or
Fascism but there is no one who has any sympathy for Imperialism
[either], not even the recruits who hire themselves out for the sake of
bread. Some join because they want military training at any cost.
Now you have a picture as true as I can draw of India to date.
My advice is don’t worry, don’t fret. You need not write, need
not speak, unless you feel an irresistible impulse. Let prayer of the
heart be our sole and sure refuge. It is enough to realize that not a
blade moves but by His will. He allows this slaughter. We do not know
why. But if we keep our hands, head and heart stainless let us believe
that in His own good time, He will use us to stop this apparently
senseless mutual slaughter.

409. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING2
SEVAGRAM ,
October 22, 1941
As regards diet, I am quite convinced that the food cooked in
the Ashram kitchen would, with slight adjustments, be suitable for the
people in Sevagram also. The food served at the Khadi Vidyalaya or
to C class prisoners would not do. The standard of food prepared in
our kitchen here would be found suitable. In this regard we have
taken into consideration the opinions of doctors all over India and we
consult them even now. At the Ashram we can protect ourselves from
a number of diseases. Whatever illness persists is due to the fact that all
of us are not frugal eaters.
1 This is written on the same sheet as the preceding item.
2 Sevagram workers had sought from Gandhiji an appointment specially to
hear his views on an ideal village community.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 227Everyone must get two 1b. of milk, two tolas of ghee and two-
and-a-half tolas of butter daily. Vegetables such as we have here are
also essential for everybody. Perhaps in the case of those who do
physical labour it may be necessary to increase the quantity of grain;
they may need dal too, though we do not use it in our kitchen. But the
quantity of milk and butter we take can be reduced to some extent.
Skimmed milk can and ought to be used in our kitchen. It is wrong in
a way not to use it. It has everything except ghee and it is cheaper too.
We certainly want to reduce the cost of our diet. Skimmed milk
should suffice for our villagers. They must have some fruit too. At
present they get no fruit at all, though they may have some sort of
mangoes during the season. They should have fruit in the same
proportion as we have for the Ashram inmates. Tamarind, lemons and
tomatoes are essential for them. They can manage with them. They
may also require some spices, though we do not have them in the
Ashram and according to me they are not at all necessary. But I do
not believe that spices have no place in our villagers’ diet. They can
have some vitamins from the spices also. But spices cannot take the
place of milk as some people mistakenly believe. I have found that the
body grows weak and health deteriorates by the excessive use of
spices. This will provide you some basis for calculating the
expenditure on food.
The second necessity is clothing. The loin-cloth such as I wear is
not meant for everybody and it is not necessary for all to adopt it.
Kurta, short dhoti and cap should suffice for men.
The women’s dress in the Ashram has been rather strange. I am
of the opinion, however, that the dress of the women of the Punjab is
the most suitable. What Amtul Salaam sometimes wears would be, with
some modifications, very good. There is art in the kurta, dupatta and
shalwar of the Punjab and in these every part of a woman’s body can
be properly covered. Mirabehn has nicely adapted it for herself. The
dupatta is artistic and at the same time very useful and comfortable
during winter. The kurta covers the woman’s body fully, the shalwar
also is a complete dress in itself and lends the wearer grace. The
ghaghra is an absolutely inadequate dress and should never be worn
without an under-wear. If we could not adopt a uniform dress even for
the women in the Ashram, it is a very difficult proposition to do so for
the whole of India. There is great scope for improvement in the
present dress of [our] women. But I am not particularly bothered228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIabout this. For the present it would suffice if we made our dresses
entirely out of khadi.
These days people huddle together and sleep in the same room
which is sometimes also shared by their cattle. It keeps them warm but
it is bad for their health, with the result that the mortality rate in India
is the highest. People will enjoy better health if they sleep in the open.
This will be possible only when they have sufficient clothing to cover
themselves as we have in the Ashram. Everyone must have at least a
blanket and a heavy sheet of khadi. People in the Ashram try to use
quilt-covers by stuffing them with paper but they become useless
during the rains. One does not, however, have to spend a lot on it.
Greater expenditure is needed on diet.
Thirdly, we have the housing problem. Here we must first decide
how much shelter is required per head. Houses can be built with grass,
mud and stalks. At present it is not so in the Ashram. I have allowed
houses to be built with bricks but pucca houses are not essential in the
villages. They are costly. Thatched mud houses would do in the
villages. Even as it is, rain water floods even our houses and we are
faced with the problem of saving people from it. Everybody should
protect his own house. I see no difficulty in it. Perhaps for years to
come the country cannot reach my ideal of housing. I agree that
houses in the Ashram are ideal houses. In order to determine the ideal
we will have to decide upon the covered area required per head. It is
however essential to provide separate shelter for the cattle. At present
people in Sevagram keep their cattle also in the house itself. Their
houses have poor sanitation. They don’t have enough room for the
children. Their houses should be so constructed as to admit plenty of
fresh air and light. Though the houses in the Ashram are poor
dwellings even the rich can live comfortably in them. The villages also
should have such houses. Today this is not the case but if the villagers
co-operate with us the situation can be improved to a great extent.
What I have said to you today is a matter of great importance. I
agree we cannot achieve complete success in the countryside unless we
have the reins of government in our hands. But if our dedication and
service attain a high degree of perfection we shall not have to depend
on the Government and a great many things can be done even without
it.
The villagers should co-operate with one another in regard to
their cattle. We should first find out the number of cattle in the village,VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 229and decide whether all of them are needed or we can do with less by
managing them on a co-operative basis. For instance, I do not
consider it proper for every villager to own a bullock-cart. Can’t we
manage with much fewer bullock-carts if we follow the co-operative
method? The same thing applies to oxen and a number of other
things. The villagers can make much more profit if they have a co-
operative society for selling their grain. The cattle of the entire village
can likewise be accommodated on a contributory basis. The villagers
can make great progress if they work like this in co-operation with
one another. Ours is a small village. We should inquire and find out in
which spheres of activity and to what extent we can work on a co-
operative basis. Even if all villagers are not inclined to follow the co-
operative method we must find out those who are prepared to give it a
trial.
Similarly, we should adopt the co-operative method in farming
too. The entire produce of the village should be distributed only
among those who have laboured for it. This does not mean that the
labour put in will not be taken into account. A proper account of the
labour put in by each individual will have to be maintained.
We should also decide about the crops we want to raise. Those
things which are essential for Sevagram should be given priority.
Cultivation for purposes of sale should be kept to the minimum. We
have been carrying on trade to some extent since the olden times and
shall continue to do so within India as well as with foreign countries. I
shall not speak about other countries. Let us consider what we can do
here.
We should produce all the other necessities in the village itself.
Then we should also find out what other industries we can set up here.
We ought to press oil and make shoes locally. Similarly we can think
of other industries also.
You should decide what it is that you want to give priority to. It
is for you to examine all the aspects of farming. I myself have not
gone deep into this aspect and therefore am not at present in a
position to guide you in this regard.
We have to think about education in Sevagram. Though you
have not asked me any question on this, I may at least tell you that in
my opinion there should not be a single illiterate person in Sevagram.
I put forward the concept of basic education very late in my life but
all the same I attach great importance to it. I had put the following230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIquestion before the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad1 : What kind of literature
are the writers bringing out for the crores of illiterate villagers? This
task is as huge as it is difficult.
Let me also tell you that our own life, if it is simple and pure, is
bound to have its impact on the villagers without our having to tell
them in so many words. It is not our way to argue. All our personal
conduct should be well regulated and must conform to our ideal. We
have enough land in the Ashram and we can cultivate it as a model
farm. If I want, I can have the entire land in the village bought up but
I have forbidden further purchase of land for the time being and, until
I am able to distribute the entire proceeds among the tillers of the soil,
I do not want to purchase more land. I must ask you for the present to
set through the Ashram an example of ideal farming. They will then
try to follow it of their own accord. At present farming in the Ashram
is not as it should be and we are far behind the ideal. Our expenditure
too is excessive and we must remedy this situation. We shall make
steady progress only when we persistently direct all our experiments
towards our ideal. I want you to associate the Ashram women also with
your experiments. They will be of great help to you. You won’t be
able to do without them; besides, they have to be trained for this work.
Thus Sevagram will become a sort of republic. You may appoint
some person as your leader for a few years but later you will be able
to do without him, for a republic has no place for a leader. People
know one another closely, unlike what we find in the elections where
millions of voters don’t even know who the candidate is. A popular
leader cannot suppress the people. We had some such institution in the
olden days. But the British destroyed everything. They are trying to
suppress the villagers through their military strength. Once this force
loses its grip, there will be no place for the police, the village headman,
the patwari and the like. Only the toughs will remain. But the people
can take care of them.
Unless we do this we shall not attain the ideal social order based
on truth and ahimsa. I am convinced that a non-violent society can be
built only on the foundation of harmony and co-operation, without
which society is bound to remain violent. If we argue that this cannot
be done it will mean that a non-violent society can never come into
being. In that case our entire culture would be meaningless. How can
1 On October 31, 1936; vide “Speech at Gujarati Sahitya Parishad”,
31-10-1936.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 231we call this ideal an impossibility while professing faith in human
nature? Of course it presupposes ahimsa of a high order.
The ahmisa required for driving the British out of India need
not be of so high a quality; but the steps we shall have to take to
cleanse our own hearts cannot be taken without ahimsa of a very high
order. For instance, the Hindu-Muslim tension cannot be removed
without true ahimsa. We followed the path of ahimsa to face the
British because we had no violent force. This was not true ahimsa.
Ahimsa dwells not in the hearts of the cowards but in the hearts of the
brave. The Negroes are physically robust, their chests are worth
admiration but the British have filled them with fear, so much so that a
sturdy Negro trembles at the sight of a white child. The same is the
plight of the Indians. Although in physical strength, we are nothing
compared to the Negroes, our experiments, imperfect as they are, in
ahimsa have had a profound impact.
My faith in human nature is progressively growing. I have
concluded, on the basis of my experiments, that human nature can be
easily moulded. We have come to assume, because of our inertia, that
human nature is always the same and seldom amenable to progress.
Churchill and Hitler are striving to change the nature of their
respective countrymen by forcing and hammering violent methods on
them. Man may be suppressed in this manner but he cannot be
changed. Ahimsa, on the other hand, can change human nature and
sooner than men like Churchill and Hitler can.
If you can digest what I have said to you today and if you
acquire the strength to act accordingly, I shall be saying many more
things. Discuss fully all this amongst yourselves and put up before me
a definite scheme of what you can do. I shall answer all your doubts
from time to time. Today I have talked to you at great length and
some of the things I have said to you are not only new but also very
vital. You should try to digest them before asking me any questions,
for otherwise your questions will lack the force of careful thinking.

Sarvodaya, November 1941
  232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI410. AN ERROR
The khadi movement, I find, has gone on for more than 21
years. But while on the one hand we do not have a sufficient number
of weavers, on the other the millions of idle weavers in India do not
use our yarn for weaving. Is it any error on our part which leads to
this double failure? I shall try to answer this question today.
I am of the opinion that this is but the result of our own folly. If
I were to find fault with anyone in this effort it could be only myself.
When I placed khadi on such a high pedestal I should have considered
all aspects of the problem. However, many vital things were first
revealed to me in their generality and the finer details were only
gradually worked out. The fact that spinning involves carding was
discovered only through experience. The process of ginning cotton
came to light only later. I knew that the yarn would have to be woven
but I had not imagined then that it would be a difficult process. Even
when I knew it I did not clearly see the solution as I see it now. The
solution is that khadi workers must learn the process of weaving even
as a matter of atonement. The best of our spinners have come from
the same class. That is how we could make good progress in spinning.
In the same manner we should have made weaving compulsory for the
khadi workers. When we learn this art we shall fully understand the
weavers’ difficulties in using hand-spun yarn. Only then can we find a
remedy for the difficulties and the professional weavers will follow us
in using hand-spun yarn. Not that I had never thought of this. The
work of weaving hand-spun yarn was first started long ago by the late
Maganlal Gandhi and by Manilal Gandhi. But I did not insist that
everyone or certain people must weave, as I used to insist that they
must spin. As a result of this error the process of weaving has not been
as widely taken up by khadi workers as it should have been. I am of
the opinion that one among every five, seven or ten spinners must
become a good weaver. Weaving cannot be done by one man. One
needs a companion for fixing the warp and for sizing. One also needs
the help of a boy or a girl to load the shuttle. Any-one can handle
these processes as also the actual weaving on the loom. But what I
propose is that a certain proportion should become experts. This will
lead to great progress. It is not necessary to tell me that this is already
the practice at some centres. My complaint is that I have not
systematically insisted that one loom must operate where there are,
say, five, seven or ten spinners. Had I so insisted I would have gotVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 233today not yarn but woven goods. The large number of satyagrahis in
the prisons would not have been content with merely plying the
charkha but would have had a loom and woven their yarn.
Weaving includes tapes, webbing, towels and coarse khadi as well
as the fine dhotis or saris from Andhra with elaborately woven
patterns. When the processes of weaving all these items are present in
our minds we shall not waste a single stretch of yarn. We shall classify
the different varieties of yarn, and weave them into appropriate cloth.
This error has also led to a lot of waste. We used to throw away broken
yarn as so much waste. I know that many of the basic schools have
begun taking care to avoid such waste. We have to spread this
knowledge. This is just the beginning of basic education. In fact it is
the primary function of basic education to give thought to these
problems, to investigate them scientifically and to suggest reform
accordingly.
The most unfortunate result of this error has been our failure to
enlist every weaver for our movement. Why can we not approach the
weaver with hand-spun yarn instead of mill-made yarn? If we
acknowledge our error and atone for it, there would be such a great
improvement in hand-spun yarn that it could compete with mill-made
yarn. Perhaps it may not be possible to spin by hand as fine yarn as
the mills can produce. However, there need not be this vast difference
between the two and the weaver need not have scorn on his face, as he
now has, at the sight of hand-spun yarn.

[Before October 24, 1941 ]1
Hindi is absolutely good, language perfect and lettering quite nice.
Of course you have access to all my letters and answers. I expect
to be able to train you to do the whole of the editing in time. You
have a wonderful comand over your pen, only the thought formation
has to come. To produce the exact thought means exact
understanding. It is difficult when one has to interpret another. But it
is not beyond you I know. You should begin to throw notes at me. I
may reject them all as you see I do Mahadev’s.
I want to build a cottage for my convenience rather than yours.
You will still sit by me but if there is a room which can be called yours
it may yield many uses. You wanted to build me a little hospital. Let
this be something like it. About buying when I get the time.

434. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
SEVAGRAM ,
October 28, 1941
I have been chary of issuing statements for the guidance of
satyagrahis. The deciding reason has been to have them to be self-
guided where they are not guided by local leaders. But this chariness
can easily be overdone. Time seems to have arrived for a brief review
especially as several leaders who have been discharged have met me
and there has been much speculation about the trend or the result of
these talks. The public should know that those who were not whole-
heartedly with the Bombay Resolution2 have come out with their
doubts confirmed. Similarly those who never had any doubts have
become firmer than ever before in their opinion. As for me I never
had any doubt as to the correctness of the Bombay Resolution and
have none about the correctness of the steps hitherto taken in
pursuance thereof. If I had, I could not, would not, have led a fight
involving not only the fate of the Congress but even of the nation as a
whole. There is one saving grace in non-violent action. Unlike violent
action, it being good in itself can never do real harm.
1 Vide “Statement to the Press”, 28-10-1941.
2 Vide “All-India Congress Committee Resolution”, 22-9-1940.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 245Complaints reach me (1) that there is marked deterioration in
enthusiasm; (2) that fewer people are coming forward now than
before; (3) that those who are discharged are not seeking impriso-
nment again; (4) that there is no discipline among many satyagrahi
prisoners some of whom have no notion of non-violence or truth; (5)
that the treatment of C class prisoners is inhuman in that the food
given is bad in quality and deficient in balance. The result is that the
majority of prisoners have suffered in health, making it impossible for
many on discharge to seek imprisonment again without adequate rest
and repair. There are too complaints about want of newspapers, books
and proper sanitation; (6) that the policy of non-embarrassment is
unintelligible, as the Rulers themselves do not appreciate it, and the
fight therefore should be intensified without regard to embarrassment;
(7) that there is no life left in the Congress—there are no meetings,
there are no demonstrations, no other activity, and that there should be
a change of policy and programme even resulting in the resumption
of full parliamentary programme, including ministries, i.e., reversion
to the Poona offer1 with suitable modification.
(1 & 2) I shall consider the first two together. Enthusiasm that is
froth is of no use in non-violent action. Showy demonstrations and
the like have a value in the initial stages. Continuous feverish activity
can only promote violence and therefore retard the steady march of
non-violent action, call it battle, if that word is preferred. That fewer
are coming forward is but natural. For it must be recalled that civil
disobedience is individual and restricted to representatives, be they
even elected members of village or firka2 committee. The list of
representatives being limited it must one day be exhausted. I have no
doubt that if I made a general call and relaxed the conditions of
enrollment I should be overwhelmed by applications. I have no
machinery to examine such applications. In reality it will be mass
action which does not admit of individual examination and choice.
That call will not come before the close of the war. There is neither
warrant nor atmosphere for mass action. That would be naked
embarrassment and a betrayal of non-violence. What is more it can
1 The reference is to the A.I.C.C. resolution passed at Poona on July 28, 1940;
vide “Statement to the Press”, 15-6-1941.
2 Group246 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHInever lead to independence. Mass action at this stage without
communal unity is an invitation to civil war. If civil war is to be our
lot, it will come, but if I know the Congress mind, it will never come at
the wish or invitation of the Congress.
(3)This complaint is partially valid. It is true that some of those
who have been discharged are reluctant to go back. This is a novel
experience  for India. I had to do it in South Africa. The struggle
demanded it there as it now does here. Self-suffering has no limit. In
the former civil disobedience the occasion had not come to send the
same resisters to jail again and again. In the present one it is
inevitable. Any other course would reduce the struggle to a farce. The
alternative suggested is that substitutes should be found for those who
would not go in again. Surely that is not the way of suffering. And
how can we think of gaining independence without a full measure of
suffering? The greater the cause the richer the suffering. Therefore in
this struggle they only will count who will seek imprisonment again
and again, come what will. They may be very few. That will not
matter. Of course those who are ill will naturally not be required to go
till they are restored. Some have interpreted literally my statement1
that the discharged satyagrahis may take about a week before they go.
Each case has to be judged on merits. Shri Vinoba went in twice
within 72 hours of his discharge. He had to come to me before
reoffering civil disobedience. Hence even that little delay. Shri
Pyarelal took nearly a month before going in for the third time. There
were unavoidable causes which need not occupy the reader’s time and
attention. I have mentioned two cases which I was personally
regulating. They exemplify the elasticity I refer to. There is no shame
or harm in unavoidable delay. Hypocrisy and camouflage must be
avoided at all cost. In satyagraha there is no waste of men or time or
labour, provided that Satya is adhered to in its entirety. I can
otherwise utilize the services, as true soldiers of truth, of men and
women who will whole-heartedly carry out instructions. Thus those
who cannot for some just reason court imprisonment should engage
themselves in corporate constructive activity. Difficulty arises because
many Congressmen, though they profess or believe in C. D., have no
1 Vide “Discussion with D. K. Gosavi”, 15-5-1941.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 247faith in the constructive programme. I must proclaim from the
housetop for the thousandth time that constructive programme is an
integral part of the national movement and therefore also of C. D. C.
D. without the backing of the constructive programme is criminal and
a waste of effort. All cannot go to jail. But all must work the
constructive programme. Even in armed conflict armies are power-
fully helped by the civil population. Imagine the fate of the British
forces, if their effort was not co-ordinated with that of the civilians. I
was therefore delighted that there was a wide response from the
prisoners and the other Congressmen this time in the matter of
spinning during the spinning carnival1. I dare to believe that if
Congressmen were enthusiastic believers in communal unity and
removal of untouchability and the like, there would be no communal
discord and there would be no antagonism such as it is from Harijans.
We are the makers of our own destiny. It has been somewhat justly
said that if I am a good General, I must not grumble about my men.
For I must choose them from the material at my disposal. I plead
guilty. But I have qualified my admission by the adverb ‘somewhat’,
for I laid down the conditions from the very inception of the
programme of non-violence. My terms were accepted. If from
experience it is found that the terms cannot be worked, I must either
be dismissed or I must retire. I retired2 but to no purpose. The bond
between Congressmen and me seems to be unbreakable. They may
quarrel with my conditions but they will not leave me or let me go.
They know that however unskilled a servant I may be, I will neither
desert them nor fail them in the hour of need. And so they try, though
often grumblingly, to fulfil my conditions. I must then on the one
hand adhere to my conditions so long as I have a living faith in them
and, on the other, take what I can get from Congressmen, expecting
that if I am true, they will some day fulfil all my conditions and find
themselves in the enjoyment of full independence such as has never
before been seen on earth.
(4)There are two sides to the complaint about indiscipline. I
must here confine myself to satyagrahi prisoners only. I would
naturally like the other political prisoners to attend to what I say. It is
1 Ceremonial spinning during Gandhi Jayanti week
2 In October 1934248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwrong to say that there is universal indiscipline among Congressmen
or that all are unfit to be called satyagrahis. Cases of grave indiscipline
have been brought to my notice. I know that violent men have crept
into the organization under the guise of non-violence. But I know also
cases of exemplary discipline. Everybody knows that there are in the
movement and among the prisoners faithful Congressmen. I am
conducting the struggle in their name and for their sake. It is through
them that we may expect to win. This should mean no reflection on
those who are weak but true. Even a child of seven who performs its
allotted task faithfully will be entitled to the same credit as those who
may cheerfully mount the gallows, if thereto called.
What is happening now is a process of automatic selection.
Those who cannot stand the test will stay out without dishonour.
Hypocrites and smugglers will be cast out because they will not stand
the real heat or they will be rejected when found out.
(5)C class prisoners’ is almost a baffling question. I have said
more than once that classification is bad in itself. But the Congress has
come to no decision on the question. Meanwhile we must do the best
we can. There is no manner of doubt in my mind that the treatment of
C class prisoners is unhuman. I do not wish to blame either the
Government or the prison officials. I admit that theirs is a thankless
task. For ages almost they have been used to only one tradition. Their
mind refuses to grasp the distinction between criminals and political
prisoners. They would make no distinction between prisoners guilty
of crimes and those who rebel against constituted authority. For them
the political are worse than the others. But pressure of public opinion
has compelled distinction. The result is highly unsatisfactory. The will
on the part of the officials is lacking. Satyagrahis who seek
imprisonment cannot with any dignity quarrel with the treatment they
get, except when their honour is attacked. An irresponsible
government, which the British Government in India is may, as it often
does, defy public opinion. Satyagrahis have still to court
imprisonment. It is one of the gateways to liberty. They cannot
stipulate as to the conditions of jail life.
But weak as public opinion is, it can express itself with effect on
a matter of pure humanity. I have suggested that medical men shouldVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 249give the lead in this matter. I understand that a movement on their part
is quite likely. It is cruel to distinguish between the food of the
different classes. The needs in the majority of cases of the political
prisoners are identical. I suggest that the rations of all political
prisoners should approach what is known as balanced diet with the
permission to replenish it at the prisoner’s expense. As to sanitation
and other matters, a non-official medical committee should make
recommendations which should be given effect to at once. There
should be identity of treatment in all the provinces.
Having said this, I must warn satyagrahis against hunger-strikes
or the like. It is their duty to conform to the jail regulations in so far
as they do not come in conflict with known rules of honour, not self-
made ones by hyper-sensitive temperaments. These ought not to court
imprisonment. I suggest that it is a satyagrahi’s first code of honour
that he will conscientiously carry out jail discipline with the
reservation just mentioned. Satyagraha is a process of silent
conversion. Indiscipline and nagging are wholly inconsistent with the
ambition of conversion. I am repeating these views of mine not
without fear and trembling. For I know that jail officials have often
quoted them on wrong occasions against satyagrahi prisoners. Of
course in all I have said there is nothing against carrying out
constitutional agitation for jail reforms even as to the so-called
criminals. A satyagrahi is a universal reformer. For him there is no
distinction between criminals and non-criminals. He is out to render
service to the whole of humanity to the extent of his ability and
opportunity.
    There is the question of newspapers and books. These are as
important as food. Some would do without food but not without
newspapers and literature. I hold that deprivation of this amenity is
additional punishment for a political prisoner.
(6)Although I have dealt with the question of non-embarra-
ssment in my previous statements, I see that it still continues to agitate
many Congressmen. For one thing, it is part of the Bombay
Resolution and effect should be given to it. It is inherent in non-
violence. But it is also expedient. By causing embarrassment at this
stage, the authorities must resent it bitterly and are likely to act madly.
Of course it would be different if we had resorted to armed rebellion.250 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThen the saying ‘their difficulty becomes our opportunity’ would
apply. It is obvious that exactly the opposite rule should apply when
an opposite method is adopted. It is worse than suicide to resort to
violence, i.e., embarrassment under cover of non-violence. We may
not be “temperate and furious” at the same time.
‘But then to be logical you must give up C. D. altogether’, says
the critic. To give up C. D. would be folly. C. D. is itself completely
non-violent action. It is a duty in the face of violence without parallel.
C. D. in the present case means assertion of the right to speak against
participation in this war or all war. If we cannot do even this much
when the occasion demands it, we might as well give up non-violence.
C. D. is the assertion of a right which law should give but it denies. If
performance of a duty causes embarrassment, it cannot be helped. It is
my duty to give up drink. It would cause some loss to the tavern-
keeper. I am helpless. The authority can easily avoid embarrassment
by recognizing the elementary right of non-violent free speech.
Consideration whether the policy of self-imposed restraint creates an
immediate impression on the authority is irrelevant. Belief that it must
ultimately is inherent in belief is non-violence itself. We may not bear
ill will against the bitterest opponent.
(7)I do not share the belief that there is no life left in the
Congress. “Still waters run deep.” Congressmen are too much
attached to the Congress to let the institution die of inanity. There
seems to be no life because we have no spectacular show in the shape
of parliamentary programme or mass C. D. Things are going
according to plan. C. D. is restricted to select individuals. It will be
further restricted to those who reoffer C.D. as often as necessary. It
does not matter if the number is reduced to ten or two. The two will
represent the whole Congress. Does not one ambassador represent his
people? One can be multiplied infinitely. Parliamentary activity has
been almost stopped also according to plan. It may be, in my opinion
should be, stopped completely. But I do not wish to rush things.
Members of local boards have in many cases been withdrawn
according to plan.
Then what are the Congressmen to do if they cannot or will not
be allowed to offer C. D. and there is no parliamentary programme?
The answer is simple. There are only two things for Congressmen toVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 251do. All to carry on the thirteenfold constructive programme and some
select few to offer C.D. in addition. C.D. is a mighty weapon to be
wielded effectively by only a few in the first instance. Constructive
programme is to be worked by all Congressmen and even non-
Congressmen if they will. How can people shut their eyes to its
paramount importance? Even parliamentary programme without it is a
mere farce. We have had it till 1920. I do not deny its usefulness even
as a farce is useful. But there is no such thing as a farce without the
backing of a play. In 1920 the nation came into its own. Constructive
programme was described in so many words to be a preparation for C.
D. Parliamentary programme was given up in toto. The nation lost
nothing by it. Parliamentary programme will have its definite place
when we have a parliament of our own. Let it not be forgotten that this
is expected to be a fight to the finish. It is true that C. D. will be
suspended if genuine free speech is granted. If we do not find
ourselves free at the end of the war, resumption will be a certainty. But
that is idle speculation. If we do our present duty, whatever the
circumstances that face us at the end of the war we shall be found
ready.
Let me glance at the constructive programme. There is
communal unity. It is worth much more than the whole parliamentary
programme. Without it, the latter is useless. It becomes a field for
interminable wrangling. Complete heart-unity takes us almost
straightway to independence. Let me not be told that there will be no
unity at all or not in our lifetime. I must refuse to believe the negation
so long as there are some Congressmen working for unity. If the
Congress cannot, I know that no other institution can. For every
Congressman whatever his faith must equally represent in his own
person every Indian, no matter what his faith is. In that sense he
belongs to all religions.
Then take untouchability. I repeat that if untouchability lives,
Hinduism and with it India dies. Is that not a programme worth living
for, dying for? And the spinning-wheel whose every turn brings India
nearer her destiny? Surely it can fully occupy every day of every
Congressman. And the wheel being the centre of our solar system it
includes all the planets in the shape of village industries.
The wheel brings us at once to the emancipation of India’s252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImanhood, kisans, labourers and all those who are weary and heavy-
laden. If this all-inclusive and mighty programme is not understood
and appreciated by Congressmen they do not know the A B C of non-
violence nor do they know the elements of C.D.
This programme gives ample scope for public meetings,
demonstrations, exhibitions and the like. No official Congress
Committees need function for co-ordinating these activities. Wherever
five earnest Congressmen are found, they can group together and
organize them.
Congress will now see why I contemplate no change in the
programme as it is going and why I am full of hope for the future of
the country.

You are free to speak and convert the people to your views1.

449. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS
WARDHAGANJ ,
October 30, 1941
Asked for his reaction to the hunger-strike by detenus1 in Deoli Camp Jail and
the Government communique thereon, Mahatma Gandhi said :
The communique was unfortunate. I am generally averse to
hunger-strikes by prisoners but I cannot help recognizing that at times
they have no other honourable recourse for the redress of grievances.
It is cruel for the Government to say that they will not consider
grievances unless the strike is given up. It is tantamount to saying that
the sufferers should not suffer for the redress of wrongs done to them.
I should have thought a responsive Government would all the
more readily listen to appeals of the wronged when they are
accompanied by self-inflicted suffering. If the demands are just, and
they seem to be just according to Sri N. M. Joshi’s report, justice
should be expedited in order to alleviate avoidable suffering

     454. WHAT JESUS MEANS TO ME1
Although I have devoted a large part of my life to the study of
religion and to discussion with religious leaders of all faiths, I know
very well that I cannot but seem presumptuous in writing about Jesus
Christ and trying to explain what He means to me. I do so only
because my Christian friends have told me on more than a few
occasions that for the very reason that I am not a Christian and that (I
1 The source reproduced this from Inner Culture .  The date of the writing,
however, is not available.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 261shall quote their words exactly) “I do not accept Christ in the bottom
of my heart as the only Son of God”, it is impossible for me to
understand the profound significance of His teachings, or to know
and interpret the greatest source of spiritual strength that man has ever
known.
Although this may or may not be true in my case, I have reasons
to believe that it is an erroneous point of view. I believe that such an
estimate is incompatible with the message that Jesus Christ gave to the
world. For he was, certainly, the highest example of one who wished to
give everything asking nothing in return, and not caring what creed
might happen to be professed by the recipient. I am sure that if He
were living here now among men, He would bless the lives of many
who perhaps have never even heard His name, if only their lives
embodied the virtues of which He was a living example on earth; the
virtues of loving one’s neighbour as oneself and of doing good and
charitable works among one’s fellow-men.
What, then, does Jesus mean to me? To me He was one of the
greatest teachers humanity has ever had. To His believers He was
God’s only begotten Son. Could the fact that I do or do not accept
this belief make Jesus have any more or less influence in my life? Is
all the grandeur of His teaching and of His doctrine to be forbidden
to me? I cannot believe so.
To me it implies a spiritual birth. My interpretation, in other
words, is that in Jesus’ own life is the key of His nearness to God; that
He expressed, as no other could, the spirit and will of God. It is in this
sense that I see Him and recognize Him as the Son of God.
But I do believe that something of this spirit, that Jesus
exemplified in the highest measure in its most profound human sense,
does exist. I must believe this; if I do not believe it I should be a scep-
tic; and to be a sceptic is to live a life that is empty and lacks moral
content. Or, what is the same thing, to condemn the entire human race
to a negative end.
It is true that there certainly is reason for scepticism when one
observes the bloody butchery that European aggressors have un-
loosed, and when one thinks about the misery and suffering prevalent
in every corner of the world, as well as the pestilence and famine that
always follow, terribly and inevitably, upon war.
In the face of this, how can one speak seriously of the divine
spirit incarnate in man? Because these acts of terror and murder
offend the conscience of man; because man knows that they represent
evil; because in the inner depths of his heart and of his mind, he
deplores them. And because, moreover, when he does not go astray,262 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImisled by false teachings or corrupted by false leaders, man has within
his breast an impulse for good and a compassion that is the spark of
divinity, and which some day, I believe, will burst forth into the full
flower that is the hope of all mankind.
An example of this flowering may be found in the figure and in
the life of Jesus. I refuse to believe that there now exists or has ever
existed a person that has not made use of His example to lessen his
sins, even though he may have done so without realizing it. The lives
of all have, in some greater or lesser degree, been changed by His
presence, His actions, and the words spoken by His divine voice.
I believe that it is impossible to estimate the merits of the various
religions of the world, and moreover I believe that it is unnecessary
and harmful even to attempt it. But each one of them, in my judg-
ment, embodies a common motivating force : the desire to uplift
man’s life and give it purpose.
And because the life of Jesus has the significance and the
transcendency to which I have alluded, I believe that He belongs not
solely to Christianity, but to the entire world; to all races and people, it
matters little under what flag, name or doctrine they may work,
profess a faith, or worship a god inherited from their ancestors.

they are not a party if they are against no one. Did Jesus and his
twelve chosen disciples form a party or not?
And is there any difference between Imperialism and Nazism? I
see none. The latter is the logical outcome of the first. I cannot take
up arms for Imperialism in the vain hope of destroying Nazism. I
would rather be ground down between the two in resisting them
unavoidably. Surely your logical brain should see this.

463. LETTER TO SUSHILA NAYYAR
November 2, 1941
CHI. SUSHILA,
I have your letter. I understand about Ba. Ba’s case is difficult.
What you write about me is unnecessary. I am trying my very
best to abide by everything you say. I am not allowing my sleep to be
disturbed. I am also talking very little [during my walks]. I keep my
eyes closed and observe silence in the evening as far as possible. With
just three drops of sarpagandha  the blood–pressure too has come
down. I continue the efforts to further control it. I am sure if you were
present here, you would have brought it under control more
effectively. So, pass your examination and come down. I like your
self-confidence. But it must be backed by an equal measure of
reading.
Suggest something for Sardar if you think it necessary. I give
him a diet of soup of leafy vegetables and honey. He feels full of
spirit.

I have your letter. The depressed classes question is very
complicated. It transcends politics. If enough money cannot be raised
for our conference it should be postponed. How much can you get
with my help? It will be more befitting if you make do with whatever
you can collect on your own. You must also have a clear aim in view.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 267Remember that Dr. Ambedkar has placed a definite aim before
himself. Study it. Digest it. And also understand fully what your own
is.

MY DEAR IDIOT,
It will be nice to make the help to Harijans dependent upon their
conforming to your conditions. You should raise a whole-time worker
there.
Your dream was strange. Sometimes these do come. I attach no
importance to them.
When you come you will miss Raihana. She has become a
member of the family and sings every evening. She has taught some a
few verses from the Koran. She sings the shlokas1 correctly.

There is no analogy between my selling blankets to a murderer

what is the good of your continuing to be a member of the same?

I was glad to hear from you. As you know I never told our

raised enough money themselves to enable me to make an appeal for
funds. Now of course it is too late for me to do anything. But you are
there to guide them.
Now that I am writing to you, I feel tempted to tell you that I
have read the appeals you have made to me from time to time with
respectful attention. But I felt sorry that I could not make the response
you expected, without denying the faith of a lifetime.
I hope you are keeping fit.

November 7, 1941
CHI. SUSHILA,
I have your letter. In my estimate Sardar’s health is on the
mend. You may ask Kishorelal why he thinks it is causing anxiety. I
cannot ask him now as we are in the middle of a meeting.
Ba, one may say, has recovered. That is why I have not written to
you. She has been taking only medicines prescribed by you. She does
not listen at all about taking rest. Once she got angry with me and said
she was determined to keep on working. I laughed it away.
Mahadev has received a communication from the Government
about Bhai. It says that no permission can be given except on very
special grounds. Only relatives can get such permission. I am afraid
Pyarelal is going to refuse to meet anyone at all. Vinoba has stopped
receiving visitors. Now the correspondence will be prolonged.
For now it will be better for you to stay only at Puri’s. If you
see any particular advantage in staying at the doctor’s, you may
certainly go and stay there and say no to Puri. Think about it and
write to me.
I feel quite fit. I get a backache from fatigue. It is in the region
of the shoulders. Prabhavati suggests it might be something else. That
is why I am writing to you. Can there be any other reason for it except
fatigue?
About Chakrayya, Lakshmipati writes that he has quite recov-
ered. He has no fever. He walks two miles.
Annapurna’s weight can be said to be very good.Mahadev has
gone to Gwalior. He will return on the 11th or earlier. He may visit
you there for a day.

very nature a physical connection, not so genuine friendship. But this276 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdiscussion will take us into deeper waters. No time for it.

Your letter. You are off the track. You need no permission even

the right of free speech by Congressmen.
I have given you my personal view of the working of non-
violence.2 You are in no way bound to accept it.
No one wants you or expects you to gag yourself even for one
day. You are free save for the restraint you put upon yourself by
reason of ill health or otherwise.
 My statement3 demands the freest expression of their views by
Congressmen. Therefore please feel free to express yourself in any
manner you like and whenever you like.
Your difficulty has evidently arisen from the mistaken notion
that you were labouring under a legal gag which needed lifting.

MY DEAR A.,
Your letter. It is well Rajasaheb3 is gone. He was a living death. I
felt I should send your a wire. And so one is going.
Bul has been here for a few days. Gosibehn came in last night
from Mussorie having seen Indu and J[awahar] L[al].
I reported to you about the apples.
This record from Vaidya4 is very good. You should write to
him.

508. STATEMENT ON INDO-CEYLONESE PACT
WARDHA,
November 11, 1941
The proposed Indo-Ceylonese Pact1 is not open to the fatal
objections that have been universally raised against the Indo-Burman
thing,2 which was sprung upon an unsuspecting public as an almost
settled fact. What has come from Ceylon is a proposal for examination
by the Government and the public. I have studied the relevant papers
as much as possible.
On merits, the Ceylon proposal is open to objection in the same
manner as the Burman. I suggest to Ceylon Ministers that there is no
reason whatsoever for hurry. Adjustment can easily be made about the
supply of labour, but wholesale legislation may be left over till after
the war. The war is a terrible tragedy, the like of which is unknown to
history. But the tragedy will be deeper still, if at the end we find
1 The status and rights of Indians in Geylon, which were threatened by the
proposed Immigration Ordinance of Ceylon Government, were sought to be safe-
guarded and in some respects improved in the joint report, published in New Delhi on
October 16, by the Indian and Ceylonese delegations to the exploratory conference
held in September in Ceylon.
2 For Gandhiji’s statement on Indo-Burman Agreement, vide “Statement to the
Press”, 24-8-1941.286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIourselves living the old way without radical changes in every walk of
life.
Let me recall here the goodwill mission that was sent by the
Congress in July 1939 in the person of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. It
had created a deep impression upon the Singhalese and their Minis-
ters. It was hoped that the good seed sown by our ambassador would
fructify. When the Ceylon deputation came to India in November last,
it was arranged that they would meet him in Allahabad. But he was
arrested before they could meet. Jawaharlal had prepared a note for
them. It will be published, if I find it necessary to do so.
My object in recalling the mission and the attempt made
thereafter is to point out the way to lasting peace and brotherliness
between Ceylon and India. It is unthinkable that Burma, Ceylon and
India should distrust one another or regard the presence of their
nationals among their neighbours as antagonistic to one another.
Any harmful migration from one country to the other may
surely be regulated by voluntary adjustment without much legal inter-
ference. I feel somehow that no harm has accrued to Ceylon by the
settlement of Indians there. As elsewhere, Indian merchants and pro-
fessionals had followed in the wake of labour imported wholly for the
benefit of Ceylon.
Sir Edward Jackson’s report, I understand, clearly shows that
Indian emigration to Ceylon has done no harm to the indigenous
population.
But, if my plea for patient waiting falls on deaf ears, I suggest
much the same thing that I have suggested for Burma. I should have
no difficulty in persuading experienced legislators that in legislation
affecting men in the street and addressed to the masses the simplest
and shortest method is best. I, therefore, suggest that the whole of the
Indian population found in Ceylon on a given date (kept secret)
should be registered and clothed with full rights of citizenship. Those
who may be outside Ceylon but who can unquestionably be proved to
be bona fide residents of Ceylon should also be registered on
application. This procedure obviates the intricacies which permeate
the proposal under examination.
The term ‘domicile’ should find no place in such legislation.
The English law of domicile is the worst possible. Judges have been
known to have been confused over the interpretation of the term.
Human liberty is a precious thing, which must not be trifled with by
legal subtleties and interminable wranglings in courts of law. The
wrangling attains no dignity, because it takes place in a law-court.
Men should know definitely where they stand in given circumstances.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 287So far as labour is concerned, I have no doubt that Ceylon
should have the sole right to import as much as it likes under contracts
easily to be understood and mutually agreed to between the two
Governments.
The suggested quota system should have no place in an
honourable understanding.

511. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDHAGANJ ,
November 12, 1941
I observe that there is a move to press the Government to release
satyagrahi prisoners.
It is, perhaps, appropriate to mention that so far as I know there
will be on the part of the Congress neither appreciation of nor
response to any such gesture by the Government.
Those who may be discharged will have to be invited to re-offer
civil disobedience if they are physically fit. Moreover, there will be
great resentment if distinction is made between satyagrahis and those
who are detained without trial. The Government should not be judges
of what is reasonable.
What the public demand is this :
Let the Government keep the prisoners, but give decent
treatment to the prisoners whether they hunger-strike or not. They
need not take notice of such strikes when there is no reasonable cause
for that.
The Deoli prisoners’ demands as far as they are known are just.
Let them end the terrible suspense by granting the demands and
ending the hunger-strike.
Let them also examine the recently published weighty manifesto
by representative and prominent medical men from all India on the
1 Gosibehn Captain, grand-daughter of Dadabhai NaorojiVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 289dietary of C class prisoners and make the necessary changes and
redress such other disabilities which have no just basis.
I, therefore, suggest to those who are urging the Government to
discharge satyagrahi prisoners that they will do well if they will
concentrate on the relief herein suggested.1 It can be granted quickly
without any political or other embarrassment.

My pain is much reduced. But if it does not subside, I shall take

The way you answered Mother was correct, yet it would have
been better not to answer her. Mother will not take it amiss. But it was
uncalled for. You should maintain silence in the face of the wrath of
the elders.
I have been sleeping in the verandah since yesterday. Do not

You must realize that people here too are a family. Everybody
is longing for you. You have written the right thing to Shankar.
Mother should definitely come in December. Mahadev cannot
get permission, but Mother certainly can. It is another matter if

520. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDHAGANJ ,
November 14, 1941
I sent the following telegram1 to Shri Jayaprakash Narayan on
the 12th instant.
To this, I have just received the following reply :
Thanks for the telegram. Have explained the whole position to Sardar Mangal
Singh. Our demands are reasonable. Please excuse inability to discontinue the
hunger-strike. May do what you can outside. Do not send Prabhavati.
I have heard nothing as yet from Sardar Mangal Singh. shall, no
doubt, do so in due course. But the matter is too urgent to brook
delay. I have heard that Shri Jayaprakash has lost heavily in weight.
Forcible feeding can only be a temporary makeshift. Shri Jayaprakash
is one of the most determined of workers. I flatter myself with the
belief that if anything could have melted him our joint telegram
should have. His preventing his wife from going to him is ominous.
He wants no interference, emotional or other, with his decision.
1 Not reproduced here; vide “Telegram to Jayaprakash Narayan”, 12-11-1941VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 293So far as I can see, there is no political motive behind this
hunger-strike. The refusal to consider the case until the hunger-strike
is given up is a cruel joke. It would be an act of inhumanity if Shri
Jayaprakash and his fellow-detenus are detained till their lives are in
danger. I appeal to the Government, in the name or humanity,
forthwith to grant the request of the detenus. The plea of ascertaining
and carrying out the wishes of the Provincial Governments is irrele-
vant and untenable. The Central Government is in no way bound to
oblige the Provincial Governments in matters where the life and
liberty of the citizen is involved. There must be something radically
wrong if the Provincial Governments are afraid to keep their own
detenus within their borders.
This continuing hunger-strike shows the futility of discharging
civil resistance prisoners who have themselves sought imprisonment.
With what face can they come out when those who have not sought
imprisonment are detained without trial and are hunger-striking      
for the minimum of conveniences to which every human being is
entitled?

you come here, you will of course bring him along with you. If
Champa arrives in December we shall see what can be done. I agree
with Manju’s analysis.

but Kanu. Kanu can wait indefinitely.
It is good that Vina2 is to take [up] work. The post offered is

something if not disabled and there would be nor penury. It comes

  540. HOW TO PAY THE EIGHT-ANNA WAGE?
The satyagrahis as well as the others who have courted arrest are
spinning a lot during the present movement. I am receiving news from
all the prisons that spinning is going on with great enthusiasm and
interest. For me this is heartening news. It may be said that Shri
Dhirendra Majumdar is a paragon among the prisoners. He spins
himself, makes others spin and has been deeply pondering over the
methods of improving the charkha. I have received a letter from him302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwhich deserves serious consideration. I am, therefore, reproducing it
below for the benefit of khadi-lovers.1
This scheme seeks to realine the dream of paying the spinners
and ultimately all labourers, i.e., craftsmen, eight annas for an eight-
hour day. It does not attempt to give everyone everything here and
now. But the attempt is to show that all this can be achieved within ten
years.
Bhai Dhirendra does not express a definite opinion on the
scheme but seeks the opinion and comments of other experts. Maybe
he does not have in the prison all the necessary literature on the
subject. About the scheme at the moment I can only say that all khadi
workers should examine it and experiment in this direction. Small
experiments need almost no capital. For exapmle, training ten or
twenty spinners and a few teachers and keeping a record of the results
should not involve much expenditure.
The chief merit of the scheme lies in its being almost self-
supporting. It consists of two parts. It does lay a little burden on the
institution in the form of enhanced wages. But the other half deals
with payment to the spinners after training them for higher produc-
tion. Another merit of the scheme is the attempt at all-round reform in
the spinners’ lives. I attach importance to the scheme from this point
of view. This scheme is not the handiwork of an ignorant khadi-lover
but has been thought out by a responsible and practical worker.
Dhirendra Babu is not merely the author of this scheme. He is himself
going to implement it.
Every experimenter in the field should remember that the
scheme takes into consideration all the processes from cotton growing
to weaving.

small area and its gradual extension in ten years.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 303541.  TELEGRAM  TO  BHURALAL  BAYA  1

551. LETTER TO AMARNATH JHA
SEVAGRAM , WARDHA,
November 20, 1941
BHAI AMARNATHJI,
I venture to write to you without earlier acquaintance.
Your election as President of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan made
me glad as well as sad. Who would not be glad at the election of a
scholar like you? But I must confess that I was sad, too; because I had,
in the interest of work, wanted Rajendra Babu to be the President this
year. That is why Seth Jamnalal Bajaj proposed the name of Rajendra
Babu.
You are of course aware that I have been closely associated with
the Sammelan for many years. I had a hand in framing the policy of
the Sammelan towards propagation of Hindi. It has developed someVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 307political overones too. I shall not be able to attend the Sammelan.
Hence myself and a few friends thought that the election of Rajendra
Babu would safeguard the interests of the Sammelan.
But this did not happen. Now all my hopes rest on you. I hope
to secure your help in what I had expected from Rajendra Babu.
It will be common ground between you and me that all of us
should endeavour to do our best, keeping in view the accommodating
attitude of Tandonji1 who is the soul of the Sammelan, and all the
other things we know he stands for.
I do not know whether or no you approve of the policy adopted
at Indore2 and Nagpur3. Some attempts were made at Poona to change
that policy. The attempts did succeed to some extent. I do not how-
ever regard these changes as intolerable. But further steps in that
direction will become unbearable for persons like me. My efforts
would be to move a step further than at Nagpur. I am convinced this
would secure the progress of Hindi and the welfare of the nation.
Hindi-Urdu controversy should not have been started nor should it be
continued.
There have been sharp differences about the Wardha office.
That office must be subordinate to the Sammelan but I think it should
have as much autonomy as the Madras office. If it is agreed that the
Wardha office has well served the cause of Hindi, it should, I think,
enjoy greater autonomy than it has today.
Rajendra Babu’s presence at the Sammelan is uncertain. He
cannot stand the December weather of the Punjab. Nor can Seth
Jamnalalji go. Kakasaheb Kalelkar and Acharya Shriman Narayan
may go. Please lend your ear to them. I wish there should be no
conflicts at the Sammelan nor any meaningless controversy. If there
are differences on principles, let them be expressed in a friendly spirit.
Therefore I would request you, if you can spare the time, to come
here for a day so that all of us can meet and talk things over. Rajendra
Babu and Jamnalalji are here for the time being. If you cannot come
for want of time or for other reasons, I can send Kakasaheb and

November 25, 1941
MY DEAR AMRITLAL,
I have your letter. So long as you feel grieved by my conduct,
how can you forgive me? I have no conviction of wrongdoing. Just
think clearly a bit. Was I in any way bound to pay you a single pice?
You pleaded inability to get on with the Bengal workers. You wanted
to come to Sevagram. I took pity and let you come. Inch by inch I
came to know of your difficulties and I began to accommodate you.
When I thought you to be unworthy of support, I declined to con-
tinue, after notice. Was that a wrong done to you? You yourself admit
that you acted hastily and thoughtlessly. I acted in the only honou-
rable way I could. I was disbursing public funds. You should know314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthat I brought you here almost against the wish of trusted co-workers.
Your wants were and are beyond your market value. I doubt whether I
should have given you the support I did. I still continue to do what I
can for you because I believe you to be a person willing to serve but
with reasoning faculty gone astray. Your present letter is proof of
what I say.
I suggest your showing all the correspondence between us to
your friends or rather the other workers. Let Dhirenda say what he
thinks of it. It is a serious thing for you to harbour the wrong against
me and be satisfied that all is well.
Of course if you harbour any wrong against me, your wife
cannot help it. And it is but natural that she cannot send Abha to such
a man as me. I hope this letter will clear all your doubts. If it does not,
you should pursue the inquiry till you convince me of my error or are
yourself convinced of doing wrong to me in thinking as you do.
You are wrong about Sailen. He is not going to help Rishabhdas
but the latter is willing for my sake to take him up. Had you not been
in need of money, I might not have sent Sailen. S[ailen] too likes the
job.
Love.

I have your letter after many days. It will hurt me if you do not
write from sheer lethargy. The thought that your studies are getting
disturbed is unbearable. You may well pass in the examination, but
your studies being disturbed without cause can only result in harm.
Whether it is Satya or any other friend who comes, your studies must
not be interrupted.
 I wish you would abandon the idea of living elsewhere and
stick to Puri’s. I would change my view if you found a more comfor-
table place than Puri’s. But I prefer Puri’s house. Once we take a
decision we should not change it all of a sudden.
You cannot also change the decision to get away for three
months. It does have its advantages. Why worry about the loss of pay?
Surely you are not going to stick to the salary. No, you must not
change the three-month decision.
I had a dream only yesterday that you are sure to get your
 M. D.; that you are extremely talented and have been offered a salary
of three or four hundred rupees for a couple of years merely to ena-
ble you to enhance your knowledge; I had to take a decision and I

neither any offer nor did I have to take any decision.

570. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDHAGANJ ,
November 27, 1941
The discontinuance of the hunger-strike by the Deoli detenus
relieves the terrible tension under which the public was labouring. It
was not possible to contemplate with unconcern the starvation, even
self-inflicted, of patriots, whether one agreed with their method or not.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 317Let us hope that repatriation will be hastened and their treatment will
not be worsened for their removal to their respective provinces.
I have read the Government communique describing the
bewitching life in Deoli. I recall a similar description of life in the
Andamans. It read like a fairy tale and yet most of the inmates
preferred to return home. These descriptions, however truthful they
may be in the estimation of the writers not themsleves detenus, do not
answer the reality as the detenus see it. The object of the communique,
on the face of it, is to show that the condition in Deoli was superior to
what it was in the respective provinces. If such was the case, it shows
how correct and proper was the demand of the hunger-strikers that
their condition on repatriation should be no worse than in Deoli. I
should translate the demand thus :
(1)Repatriation should not be to a remote godforsaken place
in the detenu’s province. The object of repatriation would be wholly
frustrated if the detenus are transferred to a place far away from their
homes.
(2)The conveniences and food should be as near to Deoli’s
latest standard as possible.
That is so far as the prisoners’ demands are concerned. But
something more is needed. Seeing that the detenus have not been
tried, the burden is on the Government to give them as decent a
treatment as possible. War economy has no place in this connection,
for detention is itself a war measure and could not be justified on any
other ground. Therefore, they are entitled to family allowance and
travelling expenses for their families when necessary. It should be
remembered that most of the detenus are poor people. So much as to
Deoli.
But I feel that the question of food, sanitation and classification
is and should be treated as an all-India question. I confine myself just
now only to political prisoners, whether detenus detained on suspicion
or satyagrahis who have courted imprisonment. If I had the authority,
I would treat all prisoners alike, making a distinction only on the
ground of health and habit. But I must not complicate the main issue
by raising others [that] do not demand immediate solution. I think
that classifications should be scrapped. At best they are arbitrary.
The scale prescribed in the very weighty and reasoned manifesto
recently issued by eminent medical men representing the whole of
India should be accepted forthwith as the minimum scale for all India,
with such variations as staples grown in various provinces may
demand. All political prisoners should have the right to supplement
their food and other requirements from their own pockets.318 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIAll should be supplied with a selection of newspapers and
magazines of known standing without any censoring. There should be
no restrictions as to choice of books. What is not generally prohibited
in India should be allowed to prisoners. They should be allowed to
write letters and receive visitors on the same scale as in B class.
It should be common cause that no recognition should be given
to hunger-strikes for wringing illegitimate concessions nor need they
be penalized by refusal to consider legitimate demands on merits. For
a prisoner under stress, hunger-strike is the last non-violent remedy.
He seeks to end imposed suffering by self-imposed suffering. He
thereby hopes to melt the heart of authority or at least enlist the
sympathy of the public. Experience shows that the method is not to be
despised. It has succeeded in several cases. But it is not easy to know
always whether the cause for which a strike is undertaken is valid. We
know, too, that Governments do not always come to a right decision in
such cases. I have before me the case of a prisoner, who has given up
his strike at my instance. The cause, as transpires in the record of the
case before me, seems to have been more than valid. The vegetables
served contained a dead scorpion. The men who had resorted to
hunger-strike are now being tried for breach of jail regulations in that
they refused the food served. There is the Chunar hunger-strike now
going on for a fortnight. It is in respect of the treatment of C class
prisoners. I have wired pleading for its suspension.1
       I think that hunger-strikes should not be regarded as a crime,
but whenever such a strike takes place it should be referred to a
judicial tribunal with the right to the prisoner to be represented by a
lawyer of his choice. If the cause is found to be valid, the grievance
should be removed. If the hunger-strike is persisted in, although the
finding is against the prisoner, the fast should be ignored. If the
procedure recommended by me is adopted the probability is that
strikes will automatically decrease. Where the cause is valid, the
authorities will grant redress on a mere notice of hunger-strike and
where the strike is found to be unjustified there will be no public
sympathy. It follows that there would be no forcible feeding if the
procedure I am recommending is adopted. In rare and obstinate cases
a life may have to be lost. It is impossible always to prevent suicide,
even by fasting.
Fasting has come to stay as a remedy for redress of grievances.
It has its uses. An honest fast draws attention to a felt grievance and
1 The telegram is not available.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 319compels redress. What I have suggested is regularization of the huma-
nitarian instinct and the rescuing of a useful institution from ridicule
or contempt.

575. LETTER TO KRISHNACHANDRA
November 27, 1941
CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
It is not necessary to give jaggery to everyone. Some of the
guests sitting by my side sometimes take jaggery and sometimes do
not. Two children invariably take it. It could be offered to other
children also. It is not common practice to offer jaggery. Outsiders
have complained that a lot of sweets are served here and the criticism
is correct. This may lead to some dissatisfaction; but you should face
it and give your explanation. Starch and jaggery have the same food
value; but the processes of their digestion are different. Starch has yet
to be converted into jaggery.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 321Twig brushes can be cut only from babul or neem trees. It is
undoubtedly theft to cut them from trees not belonging to us. We
must get them from trees earmarked for us. Tell this to B[alvantsinha]
and select a tree or two. Thorns may be used as fuel or put to some
[other] use.
Govindrao does not have the strength. He is not idle, he is weak.
If a man dare not touch a scorpion, even though each of us can lift it
with our hands, how can he be compelled to do so? Govindrao is
afraid of contracting leprosy. This fear is not peculiar to him; many
people have it. This work, it is quite obvious, can be allotted only to a
willing worker.
Cleaning of latrines should be completed before meals. If that is
not possible, let it be done at 2 in the afternoon. This should be deci-
ded by common consent and from the point of view of hygiene.
Efforts are made to give advance intimation about guests.
Lanterns may be bought if necessary. I do try to reduce to the
minimum the number of people staying here.
The contact with cities is inevitable. We have to watch whether
we earn in the cities or merely help in enabling the cities to exploit the
villages. Yes, we should try to reduce to the minimum contact with
cities.
We have to create love for physical labour. The difficulty is that
guests outnumber regular inmates in the Ashram. How can the guests
be expected to labour? Make a list of the regular inmates and you will
be surprised to see how few we are.
I understand the reason for your not coming to me.
Do whatever is proper in respect of jawar. I do not like that
question.

DEAR DADACHANJI,
I have your letter. I am glad you have written so frankly as you
have done. I am entirely at one with you that our relations with the
Burmans ought to be of the most cordial character. The corres-
pondence between the Prime Minister and me was naturally perfectly
friendly on either side. I myself love the Burmese people and as you
know I had come in every close touch with the Phoongis. What con-
crete steps can be taken at present I do not know. I think the defects
that I have pointed out in the Agreement1 are real and they should be
remedied. You should, therefore, not give in on those points but try to
remove those defects by friendly negotiation. You ought not to take
an attitude of opposition to your colleagues. There is no occasion for
it.
I am glad you have not expected me to go through your very
long letter to Shri Satyamurti. I tried to read it nevertheless but had to
leave it for want of time.

Mr. Amery’s Manchester performance1 does not excite any new
reaction in me. Mr. Amery has said nothing new. It is difficult for me
to say anything more. Mr. Amery holds certain views which he is
entitled to hold. But he does not know India as well as I do. Therefore,
I see that by repeating his statement, he is doing no good either to his
own country or to India. His repeating the same untruths would not
convert untruth into truth.

SEVAGRAM ,
November 29, 1941
DEAR BAPUJEE,
Why did you give so much time to explain the wretched
unfortunate incident? If you had given me a line I should have been
satisfied. I sent you the papers because I did not want to have
anything about you on my mind without your knowing it. We may       
travel along different roads but my regard for you shall never suffer
diminution.
1 In a speech at Manchester on November 19, L. S. Amery, Secretary of State
for India, said : “We can be proud of Britain’s contribution to India.  What the Magna
Carta won for us in the rights of the individual under the law, that we have given to
India.  We have now set ourselves to achieve in co-operation with Indian
statesmanship the far greater miracle of building up within the space of a few years
that superstructure of responsible freedom which we took centuries to complete.  In
spite of suspicion we still retain the underlying goodwill and confidence in India.  But
above all there is need of goodwill between Indians themselves.”324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII got the benefit of Malaviyaji’s kaya kalpa1 by resisting it. It
was all so unnatural.

now, Raihana is here. I think of you. She can teach music very well.
She can teach other things also. But all such things only after your
examination is over. When will you be going to Lahore? Sardar, who
was having a harrowing time with six or seven doctors, is now almost
free from trouble since he came. The spasms have not ceased
completely, but he is not suffering in any way. He used to pass five
motions a day; now it is only once, and that too, with the help of
enema. He used to sepnd an hour on the toilet seat, but now he spends
fifteen minutes at the most. Only my treatment is being given—mud-
packs, hip-bath and lying in warm water. He is allowed to take as
much honey and lime as he can. He is feeling quite energetic.

December 1, 1941
CHI. SUSHILA,
I have your letter. It is certainly sad about Sita1, but you need
not get frightened. Such a thing could have happened here, too,
though of course there would be less danger here.
It is clear that you cannot leave. I think it is the duty of you
both to spend your lives there. You may bring up Sita there as best as
you can. If I brought her up, I would do so under my close personal
supervision, as I did the four [brothers] and other [children]. I do not
repent having done that. According to me, they have lost nothing. If
Harilal went to school, etc., you see the result. We cannot see the
weaknesses of barristers and degree-holders, for we are overawed by
them. In fact, there are many even among barristers and doctors who,
like Harilal, lead immoral lives and are given to drinking. But they are
big men, holding degrees, and so their weaknesses are not noticed.
And, moreover, I myself condemned Harilal, and that also is one
reason why he is on the streets. It was my duty to denounce him,
though I think “denounce” is not the right word in this context. If,
however, you are not convinced of the correctness of my advice, and
if you can overcome your desire to keep Sita with you and she herself
is willing, you may send her over and she will be educated in the
1 Addressee’s daughterVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 329manner you desire. Devdas and Ramdas bring up their children as
they think best. You both have the same right. I can only advise you
as a friend. The right belongs to the parents alone, and it is their moral
duty, too, to bring up their children in the way they think best.
Do ask Virji’s son, too. You need not feel awkward about it.
You did well, of course, to explain to Sita a woman’s function.
Instruction in regard to sex organs will do her nothing but good. If
the instruction is pure, the children will understand the right function
of the organs and will learn self-control. Everything will depend on
how the instruction is imparted. You yourself should think over this
matter. Naraharibhai has written something Kishorelalbhai also will
write to you and send you some useful literature. Please do not get
frightened.
I had Manilal’s letter also. I have sent him a reply, too.1

There is no need to drag yourself here if you are happy there. I

December 4, 1941
BHAI SAMPURNANAND,
I just got your letter. Even before your letter arrived I had, in
the course of a letter to a friend, stated that you were fully entitled to
offer criticism. It has had no adverse effect on me, although I main-
tain that there is absolutely no ground whatsoever for your criticism.
At the back of [the struggle for] freedom of speech there is [the claim
for] independence as it was at the back of the Salt [Satyagraha]. But
then this is a controversial subject. Time will reveal everything.
That leaves the question of Hindi. This controversy is meaning-
less and stems from ignorance. No one in the Congress is antagonistic
towards Hindi. And no one will suspect me of such antagonism. But I
may differ in my policy [regarding Hindi]. And if this happens to be
the case, what would be my position in the Sammelan1? I have been
dragged into the Sammelan and I can quit this moment. I regard Urdu
and the Persian script as included in Hindi. I have been maintaining
this view since the Indore [session]. The man responsible for giving to
the national language the name Hindustani [and getting it] accepted
by the Congress is Tandonji. Now what can be done? I think the
resolution was all right. And if it was so we should regard Hindustani
as a synonym for Hindi. Now tell me if there is anything wrong in it.
Rajendra Babu is not in a condition to go to Kashi. And he is certainly
not going to Abohar. Kakasaheb and Shrimanji are on their way to
meet Dr. Amarnathji.2 Maybe, now Tandonji himself will come out.
Whatever he says will be done.
Yours,
M. K. G ANDHI

WARDHAGANJ ,
December 4, 1941
In the course of an interview, this afternoon, on the Government of India’s
communique1 regarding the release of political prisoners, Mahatma Gandhi said :
As I have said before the event,2 I must repeat after the event,
that, so far as I am concerned, it cannot evoke a single responsive or
appreciative chord in me.
From my student days onward, I have been, and still claim to be,
a friend of the British people. But my friendship cannot blind me to
the fact that British representatives hold India as a bondslave. All the
freedom that India enjoys is the freedom of a slave and not the
freedom of an equal, which is otherwise known as Complete Indepen-
dence. Mr. Amery’s pronouncements do not soothe the festering sore,
but are like sprinkling chillies on it. It is in that setting that I am called
upon to examine this release.
If the Government of India are confident of the determination
of all responsible opinion in India to support the war effort, the logi-
cal conclusion would be to keep the civil disobedience prisoners in
their custody, because they produce a jarring note. The only meaning
I can attach to the release, therefore, is that they expect that the
prisoners will have changed their opinions in their self-invited
solitude. I am hoping that the Government will be soon disillusioned.
Civil disobedience was not taken up without the most careful
consideration. It was certainly not taken up out of any vindictiveness.
It was taken up, and I hope will be continued, in order to make good
the claim of the Congress to let the British people and the world know
that there is, at the very least, a large body of public opinion
represented by the Congress which is utterly opposed to participation
in the war, not because it wishes any disaster to the British arms or
1 Issued on December 3, 1941, which stated : “The Government of India,
confident in the determination of all responsible opinion in India to support the war
effort until victory is secured, have reached the conclusion that those civil
disobedience prisoners whose offences have been formal or symbolic in character,
can be set free.  Effect will be given to this course as soon as possible.  There are
provinces in which local conditions may mean delay; but before the end of the year
the Government of India hope that throughout India practically all such persons will
have been set free.  With them there will be released also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.”
2 Vide “Statement to the Press”, 12-11-1941.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 335victory to the Nazi or Fascist arms, but because it sees no deliverance
from blood-guiltiness either for the victor or for the vanquished, and
certainly no deliverance for India out of this war.
The Congress, which seeks and claims to represent the dumb
millions, has, for the past twenty years, accepted non-violence as its
unbroken policy to achieve India’s independence. To stop civil
disobedience, symbolic though it may be for the time being, will be to
deny its policy at a crucial moment. The Government claim that, in
spite of the Congress efforts, they are able to get all the men and
money from India. Therefore the Congress opposition, in their
estimate, can only be a moral effort and a moral demonstration. I, for
one, am entirely satisfied with it, because I am convinced that from
that moral demonstration will arise, when the moment comes, a
demonstration which will result in the attainment of India’s
independence, not the ascendance of this party or that. The Congress
struggle covers every single unit in India.
Now that the Congress President1 is expected to be out, it will be
for him to consider whether and when to call the Congress Working
Committee or the A. I. C. C. These two bodies will determine the
future policy of the Congress. I am but a humble instrument of
service in conducting the civil disobedience.
I would, however, say one word about the detenus and other
prisoners. It sounds strange that those who have sought imprisonment
are to be discharged and not those who are either detained without
trial or imprisoned because they hold the freedom of their country  
dearer than their personal liberty. There is surely something utterly
wrong somewhere. Therefore I cannot rejoice over the Government of
India’s decision.

December 5, 1941
MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
It is nice to be able to write to you outside the jail. But the
pleasure is only momentary for I cannot reconcile myself to these
discharges. However, we meet this new menace.
This is merely to tell you that I delayed answering your question
as the rumour about your discharge was in the air.
1 Abul Kalam Azad336 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII have read your letters most carefully. I agree with your
conclusions and I like the very generous manner in which you have
treated the whole thing. I had one and only one chat with F1. and he
accepted my proposition that he would not think of marrying Indu
without your consent and blessing. Indu wrote to J. that she was
coming and seeing me too. Now that you are out and probably will be
for a few days if not longer, you will shape this thing as you wish.
I hope you have liked the recent statements issued by me. You
will tell me when you are coming. Maulana2 telephoned today saying
he proposed to come after two or three days. I propose to leave here
on 9th for Bardoli for one month. Sardar wants me to give one month
to Gujarat. He is under treatment, mostly dietetic. I have prescribed
the diet. I think his pain is most bearable under that regime. So far as
it is possible our talks and meetings should take place in Bardoli. The
discharges are a challenge. I feel that we should hold the W[orking]
C[ommittee], A. I. C. C. meetings as early as we can. But of this you
and Maulana are the best judges.
I am writing this against time.
Love.

607. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDHAGANJ,
December 7, 1941
The jail delivery that is going on apace of satyagrahis must be
taken as a challenge to convene a meeting of the A. I. C. C. which, the
Government of India have been evidently induced to expect, will
reverse the Bombay decision, whose working is reflected in my
conduct of the satyagraha campaign. I have, therefore, advised the
Maulana Saheb to convene a meeting of the Working Committee and
the A.I.C.C. at an early date, but until that decision is reversed civil
disobedience has to go on.
I must admit, however, that the conduct of the campaign has
been rendered difficult by the Government action in discharging civil
disobedience prisoners, but if we are to reach our goal, we have to cut
our way through every difficulty. This one is nothing compared to
what we are likely to have to face before we come into our own.
If the A. I. C. C. meeting is to come, as it must, pending the
meeting members of the Working Committee and the A. I. C. C. must340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHInot offer civil disobedience, nor should those who are interested in
reversing the Bombay decision.
Apart from these, civil disobedience should continue without
interruption. Of course it will stand suspended on Xmas Day, Boxing
Day and New Year’s Day.
The question naturally arises whether civil disobedience is to be
offered in the usual manner by reciting the prescribed formula1 or in
some other manner.
I like the formula method. It gives directness and symmetry to
the movement. There is great power in the reciting of the same
formula in the same manner. It rivets the attention of the masses and
men on identical theme. The formula is not a mean thing. It is a
protest of the nation against war as an arbitrator. It is a message of
peace on earth and goodwill towards mankind. What is individual
formula today will become, in due time, that of the masses, but the
authorities having discharged symbolical satyagrahis may refuse to
rearrest them for reciting slogans.
There are then two ways open to us: If they do not rearrest, there
need be no dismay and demoralization, the jail is not our objective.
Freedom of speech is the immediate objective. If recitation is not
objected to, we have advanced somewhat towards our objective and it
will be foolish to court imprisonment for the sake of it.
Dismay and demoralization arise because Congressmen in
general have not realized the inevitable connection between construc-
tive programme and civil disobedience. Civil disobedience without the
backing of constructive programme can never lead us to indepen-
dence. Shorn of it, civil disobedience becomes method of violence
bound to prove ineffective in the end.
Moreover, civil disobedience, even when it is mass, will only be
offered by those who are bodily fit, whereas constructive programme
is for all and will never be suspended. If the whole nation took it up in
earnest it is enough to give us complete independence. The prosecu-
tion of the constructive programme means constructing the structure
of swaraj.
The whole theme of corporate non-violence, as I have conceived
it, falls to pieces if there is no living faith in the constructive
programme.
To my mind, swaraj based on non-violence is a fulfilment of the
1 Namely, “It is wrong to help the British war effort with men or money.  The
only worthy effort is to resist all war with non-violent resistance”, Vide “Instructions
to Satyagrahis”, 8-11-1940.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 341constructive programme; hence, whether the authorities jail us or not,
we must pursue the constructive programme.
I have been asked whether discharged satyagrahis should hold
or attend meetings and deliver speeches. They should do so. I do not
want or expect them to re-offer civil disobedience immediately. That
would be indecent haste, but ordinary civil disobedience may go on.
For the discharged ones let there be breathing time. Let them address
meetings in their constituencies and study things. At the meetings they
will expound their views on the general situation and not hesitate to
interpret anti-war Congress policy.
Symbolic satyagraha has a definite meaning but it is open to the
authorities to arrest Congressmen for their speeches even if they do
not intend thereby to offer C. D. That was how they had arrested the
Maulana Sahib and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, not to mention lesser
lights.
Let it be known that I have no authority to suspend C. D. on
extraneous grounds. That is for the Congress to do. For me personally
there is no choice.
As a man sworn to peace, at this critical moment to suspend my
anti-war activity would be to deny myself.
Therefore, for those who think like me, whether we are
misunderstood or worse befalls, we must express our faith through our
action hoping thereby that ultimately our way will be accepted by all
warring powers as the only escape from a blood-bath which is
reducing man to his lowest depth.

610. ASHRAM NOTE
December 8, 1941
The rules deducible from the eleven observances2 and essential
for a well-regulated Ashram life are as follows :
All members—whether permanent or otherwise—will turn every
minute of their time to good account. They will take part in every
corporate activity of the Ashram. When free from Ashram work they
will spin or carry out some other process connected with cotton. They
will prosecute their private studies from 8 to 9 p.m. or during daytime,
when they have no Ashram work to do and have done at least one
hour’s spinning.
They may not spin when they are ill or otherwise unable to spin
owing to circumstances beyond their control.
1 Vide “Letter to K. M. Munshi”, 5-12-1941.
2 Ahimsa, truth, non-stealing, brahmacharya , non-possession, body-labour,
control of the palate, freedom from fear, equal regard for all religions, swadeshi and
looking upon all human beings as touchablesVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 343No one should talk idly or in a loud voice. The Ashram must
bear the impress of perfect peace as well as of truth. Our relations with
one another must be marked by affection and restraint, and with
guests and visitors by courtesy. Whether a visitor is dressed in rags or
in gorgeous robes, we should treat him with the same respect. We must
not make any distinction between the rich and the poor, the high and
the lowly. This does not mean that we may expect a delicately
nurtured guest to live as simply as ourselves. That is to say, in waiting
upon guests, we must always take into consideration their habitual
mode of life. This is true courtesy. If an unknown visitor arrives at the
Ashram, we must ask him the purpose of his visit, and if necessary
take him to the manager. This is the duty of every inmate of the
Ashram, because we cannot know whom such a visitor is likely to meet
first.
Our every word and every act should be well considered. What-
ever we do we should do with a will and in complete identification
with the work of the moment.
Food must be taken like medicine, under proper restraint, only
for sustaining the body and keeping it a fit instrument for service. We
must therefore take food in moderation or even abstemiously. We
must be content with what food we get. If the food is insufficiently or
badly cooked, we must not talk about it at meals, but courteously
speak about it later to the manager of the kitchen. Bad or imperfectly
cooked food should not be eaten. We must not champ while eating.
We must eat our food slowly, decorously and tidily in a spirit of
thankfulness to God.
Everyone must wash his own dish thoroughly and keep it in its
place.
Guests and visitors are requested to bring their own plate, drink-
ing pot, bowls and spoon, as well as lantern, bedding and mos-quito-
net. They must not have more clothes than necessary. Their clothes
should be made of khadi. Other things must be as far as possible
village-made or at least swadeshi.
Everything must be kept in its proper place. All refuse must be
put into the dust-bin.
Water must not be wasted. Boiled water is used for drinking pur-
poses. Pots and pans are finally washed with boiled water. Unboiled
water of the Ashram wells is not safe to drink. It is necessary to learn
the distinction between boiling water and hot water. Boiling water is
that in which pulses are cooked; and which gives out lots of steam. No
one can drink boiling water.344 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIWe should not spit or clean the nose on the road, but only in an
out-of-the-way place where no one is likely to walk.
The call of nature must be attended to only at the appointed
place. It is necessary to clean oneself after answering either call of
nature. The water-jug used in the toilet is, as it should always be, set
apart. After a visit to the latrine, we must wash our hands with pure
earth and pure water, and wipe them with a clean napkin. The night-
soil must be fully covered with dry earth so as not to attract flies and
in such a way that nothing but dry earth is visible.
One must sit carefully on the latrine seat, so that the seat does
not get dirty and the stool drops into the receptacle. A lantern must be
carried if it is dark.
Everything which can attract flies should be properly covered.
Teeth must be cleaned with care at the proper place. The end of
the twig must be well chewed into a soft brush, and the teeth and the
gums must be brushed with it inside and out. The saliva discharged
during brushing must be spat out. It must not be swallowed. After the
teeth are well brushed the twig must be split into two to clean the
tongue with. Then the mouth should be carefully washed. The nose
also should be cleaned by drawing in water. The split twigs should be
washed well, and collected in a pot. When they dry up they should be
used for starting a fire, the idea being that nothing which can be used
should be thrown away.
Waste paper, which cannot be used for writing on the other side,
should be burned. Nothing else should be mixed with it.
The refuse from leafy vegetables must be kept separate and
converted into manure.
Broken glass should be thrown into a pit at a safe distance from
houses.
If anyone visits the Ashram or comes as a guest he should be
received with love. He should not feel an outsider.
In the Ashram everything should be in its proper place and
every nook and corner should be clean. No dust should be allowed to
collect on the doors, nor should they be sticky.
Everyone should do with great care the work allotted to him.
No one should absent himself from a collective task. There
should be the most scrupulous care in cleaning the utensils.
The latrines should always be kept dry. The night-soil must
always be covered with dry earth.
Much water stagnates near the water-room; this is not good.
Food should always be kept covered, so that it does not attract flies.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 345In the matter of food everyone should remember our vow about
control of the palate, and eat all the things as medicine. We should not
be perturbed if occasionally we miss an item. Whatever we get should
be accepted as God’s grace.
We should learn to understand correctly the meaning of our
prayer. Take care of the Ashram property while you are using it, as if
it were your own.

Sir E. I recently had an hour-and-a-half talk with Mr. Jinnah and heard his

: “Never will Muslims be subservient to Hindu authority. You English and Germans
are much closer to each other than Hindus and Muslims.” I would like to know what
you have to say in regard to this.

4 According to Evelyn Wrench, Editor of The Spectator , the interview took
place just before Christmas, 1941, in Gandhiji’s Ashram, Sevagram, Wardha. The
period, however, has been inferred from the fact that Gandhiji was at Wardha in
December 1941 up to the 9th, when he left for Bardoli.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 347        GANDHIJI. I deny absolutely what Jinnah sahib says. The Muslim
is as much an Indian as I am and of the same blood. There is no
fundamental cleavage between Hindus and Musalmans. We have lived
in the same land as brothers for generations and what has been
possible all these years will certainly be possible in the future. With
due respect to Jinnasahib, he resorts unconsciously to an untruth when
he says what you have just quoted, and speaks as a disappointed man
does in order to maintain his view at any cost. In any case, the fear of
subservience is quite imaginary. No one can dominate a population of
80,000,000. Can such a number be termed a minority? I personally
would resist the subservience even of the Parsis, who are a mere
handful, i.e., 1,00,000 , because I believe in equality for all and has
throughout been the Congress creed. But I admit that Jinnah sahib’s
fear though in fact imaginary is a real thing in his estimation, and
therefore he has my sympathy.
Sir E. What about the possibility of a free and equal India becoming a partner
in the British Commonwealth in the sense that Canada and Australia are partners?
G. Bitter experience has shown that India cannot be that in the
sense that Canada and Australia are. At the moment the British
Common-wealth is a Commonwealth of White nations. But I go a step
further than you. Why only a British Commonwealth? Whoever is
victor, there should be, after the war, a commonwealth of all nations.
The British Commonwealth must give a place to this and no one must
be excluded. Germany, Italy, Russia, all must come in, not only those
who are today Allies of Britain. India will gladly be a member of such
a common-wealth.
Sir E. You are indulging in undue optimism. I worked seven years for the All
Peoples Association in Europe and my experiences there during the last two decades
do not lead to hope that the real internationalism is round the corner. Anyhow, your
and my goal of universal brotherhood is common. Is it thus wise to destroy or abolish
what has stood for a Commonwealth of at least some nations when the world is not
ready for the ultimate ideal?
G. It is not a question of abolition. It is a question of extending
the scope of the British Commonwealth. If Britain wins wholly, Nazi
Germany, Fascist Italy and perhaps even Bolshevik Russia will dis-
appear. If Britain were honest, which I dispute, she would then
embrace all nations on terms of equality.
Sir E. According to the sentiments expressed in the Atlantic Charter?1
1 A joint declaration was drawn up at a series of meetings on board warships
in the North Atlantic in August, 1941 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, the then President of
the United States and Winston Churchill the then Prime Minister of the United348 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIG. What is the Atlantic Charter? It went down the ocean as soon
as it was born ! I do not understand it. And Mr. Amery denies that
India is fit for democracy, while Mr. Churchill says the Charter could
not apply to India. Force of circumstances will falsify their declara-
tions. Personally I like to believe that all become honest, the millen-
nium is round the corner!
Sir E. I know your views on pacifism. But all the same you won’t impede the
British war effort?
G. I said I would not embarrass Britain. And so far as civil
disobedience is concerned, I have demonstrated that this is so. A non-
violent man cannot desire embarrassment. And Government, in using
the term “symbolic”1 in their recent release of satyagrahis unsought
by the satyagrahis have tacitly admitted non-embarrassment. Had
Congress wished, it would have been possible to ignite a spark that
would have swept right over India and which would certainly have
deflected British energy from the war.
Sir E. You want Britain to win, don’t you? Cannot you under any circumstances
give active support to our war effort?
G. I do not wish disaster to British arms. In saying this I may be
said to have modified my original words. But I cannot give active
support in the war effort without denying a life-time of practice.
Sir E. Compared with fifteen years ago, has not British opinion moved
favourably towards India? There are two powerful sections of public opinion in Great
Britain today-one which holds that she should move closer to the U.S.A. and the
Dominion with a view to forming a federation between these English-speaking
democracies and definitely cut loose from India, which with its alien civilization they
say has little in common with the Anglo-Saxons; the other consists of those who
believe that the chief glory of the British Commonwealth is that it can admit nations
of any race, creed or colour to become   partners within its orbit. Do you not trust us?
Do you not think that we are genuine when we see the difficulties inherent in the
diffferent viewpoints of yourself and Mr. Jinnah? Would there not be civil war if we
were to withdraw?
Kingdom, stating certain common principles and policies on which the two leaders
based their hopes for a better future for humankind after World War II. It condemned
the use of force and territorial aggrandizement and defined the right of all peoples to
self-determination and self-government. Though it was incorporated by reference in
the declaration by the United Nations of January 1, 1942, the Atlantic Charter, like
many war-time declarations, it was characterized more by vague generosity that by
any precise commitment. Also vide footnot of “Interview to United Press of India”,
17-8-1941  and “Interview to H. V. Kamath”, 5-9-1941.

Britain. But it is an insignificant minority, and while I honour and like
their opinion I cannot be enthused over it, for I know that those who
shape policy and dominate are otherwise inclined. For me, therefore, it
is only the Secretary of State who counts. I see no genuine ring in his
statement. If he were honest he would not ask for an agreed solution
among us as the first step. It is obvious that if Jinnasaheb asks me for
things which I cannot give him, he will naturally go to the third party
where he can get what he wants, as he did in London during the
Round Table Conference1. The minority pact was there flung on us
one fine morning unknown to any one of us. It is one of the most
disgraceful chapters in British history. The Secretary of State should
realize that the last word is in his hands. Hence it is that I have said
you should retire and we shall have a pact in fifteen days. There may
be civil war, it is highly probable there will be, but at the end of it
there will be peace.
Sir. E. At the end of all wars there is peace.
G. You proposition was wrong. You can only have lasting peace
based on justice. We are an unarmed people. Your armies are meant to
suppress an armed rebellion and are not for use by us. The Indian
troops are mercenaries and would be of no use in the civil war. It is
the politically conscious Muslims and Hindus who will fight. They will
fight with sticks, staves and soda-water bottles, but they will soon tire,
and there will be wise men enough among us to bring about an
honourable peace.
Sir E. Are you not assuming too much?
G. I assume nothing. These are daily happenings. There is
breaking of each other’s heads for a couple of days and then there is
peace.
Sir E. But a Hindu cannot dine with a Muslim. Mr. Jinnah says these social
barriers matter a good deal.
        G. They do not. You inter-dine and inter-marry with Germans
and yet are both saturated with hate for each other.
Sir E. May I take it that you would oppose Pakistan even if it were agreed upon
by the Muslims and Britain?
G. No agreement between the British and Muslims can affect me.
An agreement between Hindus and Muslims alone will affect me.
Sir E. Do you not think that Britain has stood for freedom and democracy–take
Canada, Australia, South Africa?
1 Of 1931350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIG. You have stood for these things simply for the spoilation of
the weakers races. I have lived for twenty years in South Africa and I
know the quarrel between you and the Dutch was over the sharing of
the spoils and the same is happening elsewhere in Africa, too.
Sir E. But very few are ready for a world Commonwealth. At what moment
would you be willing to join a Commonwealth?
G. When Africa, China, Japan are all included. I cannot be
subservient anywhere.
Sir E. Are you opposed to defence behind an international group?
G. I would agree to a minimum international police force.
Sir E. What about an air-force?
G. On no account. I look upon air-power for destruction as a
terrible crime against humanity.
Sir E. But if you do not agree to an armed force to stop aggression other Hitlers
may arise.
G. They will not arise if justice prevails. Hitler is a scourge sent
by God to punish men for their iniquities.
Sir E. Take the case of Abyssinia. If there had been an armed international
force we could have stopped Mussolini from that conquest.
G. You cannot cure a lesser evil by a greater evil. You might
have succeeded in wiping out Italy, but how would that have helped?
Britain’s success in the exploitaion of non-European races raised the
ambition of Bismarck and later Mussolini and others.
Sir E. But is not the mentality now passing? I assure you it is in England. Take
the case of Iraq, to whom we have given independence.
G. I wish I could think that. I do not agree that there is freedom
in Iraq today. I do not read current history as you do. Nothing is of a
permanent nature. One can only talk of good intentions when the war
is over. I would love to see that Iraq at least had real complete
        independence after the war.
Sir E. You may call me prejudiced, but Churchill has definitely announced that
there will be no a acquisition of territory, etc.
G. You are not prejudiced. You have perforce to believe what is
told you. I have grave doubts. I mean no ill. Having given up arms, I
can mean none. I never think of imaginary evils, however. There is no
distrust of men and mankind in me. They will answer before God, so
why should I worry? But where my own mission is concerned, my
thought is active, and I try to wish everyone well in spite of doubts and
mistrust. I will suffer the agony if that is to be my lot. But I may notVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 351unnerve myself while I can struggle against evil.
Sir E. Try to believe there are more people in great Britain than you imagine in
favour of India’s inclusion as a free partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations.
I can give you proof. There is the Labour Party.
G. I believe you are a growing party. All the same, I feel you are
still insignificant. But you mention Labour Party, which is a dismal
failure today. It takes its seat in the House of Lords!
Sir E. After the war would you consider every problem if you felt India was to
be free?
G. I have shut my mind against nothing and I am a friend of
Great Britain. I always have been. I have no axe to grind. Whatever I
do is out of love.

CHI. MRIDU,
I have your letter. I cannot bear to see you fall ill. One who
wants to serve must acquire control over the body.
There is nothing wrong in your involving yourself with
women’s organizations. You have to come in close contact with
women.
We ourselves create obstacles for ourselves. Had you got rid of
your fear, you would have come to stay at Sevagram earlier. People
may not like to be here permanently. But I notice that many people
have liked it at least for a few days.
Miss Moore’s situation is as you have described. Having lived
in the same social milieu, her ideas are unsympathetic. She appeared
to me to be a good woman. She lived here very nicely. Now you may
not have to go.

617. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDHAGANJ ,
December 9, 1941
In the midst of the human conflagration which envelops the
world powers who believe in the strength of their arms, little knowing352 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwhat in reality they are fighting for, it is healthy and uplifting to
contemplate what a man like Badshah Khan, the first among the
Khidmatgars, is doing for the cause of peace and for qualifying
himself for taking an effective part by non-violent means in the
freedom movement. He has undying faith in non-violence though he
has not worked out all its implications. For the last few months, he has
been holding little camps for non-violent training of Khudai Khid-
matgars. But during the third week of November he held a biggish
one1, to which he had invited neighbouring workers from the Punjab,
Kashmir and Baluchistan. Charkha was the important activity. Over
three hundred wheels plied daily. Dhanush takli  was also introduced
in the camp. Its cheapness and the ease with which it could be manu-
factured in every village appealed to everyone. Sanitation work was
done in the surrounding villages and there were speeches explaining
non-violence. A resolution was passed appealing to tribesmen to be
peaceful and non-violent. Copies of it were printed for distribution
among those tribesmen who came into British territory. Here is the
daily routine :
6 a.m. azan1 for prayers; from 6 to 7.30 prayers; from 7.30 to
7.45 morning exercise; from 7.45 to 8 tea; from 8 to 10.55 village
cleaning; from 11 to 12 noon, school; from 12 to 2 p.m. morning
meal and rest; from 2 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. spinning; from 3.30 p.m. to
4.30 p.m. public meeting; 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. flag salutation; from 5
p.m. to 7 p.m. informal discussion; 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. evening meal; 8
p.m. to 9 p.m. roll call.
Village cleaning was done in perfectly orderly manner. Workers
were divided into several parties, carrying their own brooms. Villagers
supplemented these from their own stock and joined Khidmatgars in
this loving service. They did not leave out even police stations. Men in
charge of these gratefully accepted the service.
The camp worked like this for seven days from November 16 to
22. There were about 20 Hindus and two women in the party.
Badshah Khan, though ill himself, took part in every activity. The
camp was of the simplest character. There were no servants. One
medical man had volunteered his services which were most useful as
many men were suffering from malaria. The Government had also
sent a doctor with some medicines.

before 20-11-1941.

noon, bread made from wheat and maize with dal or vegetables; 7
p.m. ditto.
The camp consisted of about five hundred representatives and
guests from all over the N. W. F. Province. They were accommodated
in little tents without side flaps. The total cost of running the camp was
about Rs. 1,500. Congressmen and others could profitably copy the
simplicity, economy and orderliness of this camp.

621. “CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME : ITS MEANING AND
PLACE”1
[December 13, 1941 ]2
INTRODUCTORY
The constructive programme may otherwise and more fittingly
be called construction of poorna swaraj or complete independence by
truthful and non-violent means.
Effort for construction of independence so called through
violent and, therefore, necessarily untruthful means we know only too
painfully. Look at the daily destruction of property, life and truth in
the present war.
Complete independence through truth and non-violence means
the independence of every unit, be it the humblest of the nation, with-
1According to Mahatma,  Vol. VI, Gandhiji wrote this on the train from Wardha
to Bardoli. Gandhiji left Sevagram on December 9, 1941, and reached Bardoli on
December 10, 1941.  However, in his letter to Mirabehn dated December 13, 1941,
Gandhiji says, “I was immersed in writing work which is just finished.”  Apparently
he commenced writing this on the train and finished it later at Bardoli.
The version reproduced here was “thoroughly revised” and date-lined “Poona,
13-11-1945”.  The Foreword and the two Appendices appear in their chronological
places under the dates November 13, 1945, January 16, 1946, and January 27, 1948.
2  ibidVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 355out distinction of race, colour or creed. This independence is never
exclusive. It is, therefore, wholly compatible with interdepen-dence
within or without. Practice will always fall short of the theory, even as
the drawn line falls short of the theoretical line of Euclid. Therefore,
complete independence will be complete only to the extent of our
approach in practice to truth and non-violence.
Let the reader mentally plan out the whole of the constructive
programme, and he will agree with me that, if it could be successfully
worked out, the end of it would be the independence we want. Has not
Mr. Amery said that an agreement between the major parties, trans-
lated in my language, any agreement after communal unity which is
only one item in the constructive programme, will be respected? We
need not question his sincerity, for if such unity is honestly, i.e., non-
violently, attained, it will in itself contain the power to compel
acceptance of the agreed demand.
On the other hand there is no such thing as an imaginary or
even perfect definition of independence through violence. For it pre-
supposes only ascendancy of that party of the nation which makes the
most effective use of violence. In it perfect equality, economic or
otherwise, is inconceivable.
But for my purpose, which is to convince the reader of the
necessity of following out the constructive programme in the non-
violent effort, the acceptance of my argument about the ineffective-
ness of violence for the attainment of independence is not required.
The reader is welcome to the belief that independence of this hum-
blest unit is possible under a scheme of violence, if this effort enables
him also to admit that it is a certainty through the complete execution
of the programme by the nation.
Let us now examine the items :
1. COMMUNAL  UNITY
Everybody is agreed about the necessity of this unity. But
everybody does not know that unity does not mean political unity,
which may be imposed. It means an unbreakable heart unity. The first
thing essential for achieving such unity is for every Congressman,
whatever his religion may be, to represent in his own person Hindu,
Muslim, Christian, Zoroastrian, Jew, etc., shortly, every Hindu and
non-Hindu. He has to feel his identity with every one of the millions
of the inhabitants of Hindustan. In order to realize this, every Con-
gressman will cultivate personal friendship with persons represent-ing
faiths other than his own. He should have the same regard for the
other faiths as he has for his own.356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIn such a happy state of things there would be no disgraceful
cry at the stations such as “Hindu water” and “Muslim water” or        
“ Hindu tea” and “ Muslim tea”. There would be no separate rooms
or pots for Hindus and non-Hindus in schools and colleges, no
communal schools, colleges and hospitals. The beginning of such a
revolution has to be made by Congressmen without any political
motive behind the correct conduct. Political unity will be its natural
fruit.1
We have long been accustomed to think that power comes only
through Legislative Assemblies. I have regarded this belief as a grave
error brought about by inertia or hypnotism. A superficial study of
British history has made us think that all power percolates to the
people from parliaments. The truth is that power resides in the people
and it is entrusted for the time being to those whom they may choose
as their representatives. Parliaments have no power or even existence
independently of the people. It has been my effort for the last twenty-
one years to convince the people of this simple truth. Civil disobe-
dience is the storehouse of power. Imagine a whole people unwilling
to conform to the laws of the legislature, and prepared to suffer the
consequences of non-compliance. They will bring the whole legis-
lative and executive machinery to a standstill. The police and the
military are of use to coerce minorities however powerful they may
be. But no police or military coercion can bend the resolute will of a
people who are out for suffering to the uttermost.
And parliamentary procedure is good only when its members
are willing to conform to the will of the majority. In other words, it is
fairly effective only among compatibles.
Here in India we have been pretending to work the parlimentary
system under separate electorates which have created artificial incom-
patibles. Living unity can never come out of these artificial entities
being brought together on a common platform. Such legislatures may
function. But they can only be a platform for wrangling and sharing
the crumbs of power that may fall from rulers whoever they may be.
These rule with rod of iron, and prevent the opposing elements from
flying at one another’s throats. I hold the emergence of complete
independence to be an impossibility out of such a disgrace.
1 The first edition here has the following additional paragraph : “The
implication of such heart unity may seem startling, though it is the logical necessity.
Congressmen cannot aim at parliamentary power in opposition to persons of other
faiths.  Congressmen, therefore, will refrain, so long as these differences last, from
entering the parliamentary arena.”VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 357Though I hold such strong views, I have come to the conclusion
that so long as there are undersirable candidates for elective bodies,
Congress should put up candidates in order to prevent reactionaries
from entering such bodies.
2. REMOVAL OF UNTOUCHABILITY
At this time of the day it is unnecessary to dilate upon the
necessity of the removal of this blot and curse upon Hinduism.
Congressmen have certainly done much in this matter. But I am sorry
to have to say that many Congressmen have looked upon this item as
a mere political necessity and not something indispensable, so far as
Hindus are concerned, for the very existence of Hinduism. If Hindu
Congressmen take up the cause for its own sake, they will influence
the so-called sanatanis  far more extensively than they have hitherto
done. They should approach them not in a militant spirit but, as befits
their non-violence, in a spirit of friendliness. And so far as Harijans
are concerned, every Hindu should make common cause with them
and befriend them in their awful isolation—such isolation as perhaps
the world has never seen in the monstrous immensity one witnesses in
India. I know from experience how difficult the task is. But it is part
of the task of building the edifice of swaraj. And the road to swaraj is
steep and narrow. There are many slippery ascents and many deep
chasms. They have all to be negotiated with unfaltering step before we
can reach the summit and breathe the fresh air of freedom.
3. PROHIBITION
Although like communal unity and removal of untouchability
prohibition has been on the Congress programme since 1920,
Congressmen have not taken the interest they might have taken in this
very vital social and moral reform. If we are to reach our goal through
non-violent effort, we may not leave to the future government the fate
of lakhs of men and women who are labouring under the curse of
intoxicants and narcotics.
Medical men can make a most effective contribution towards the
removal of this evil. They have to discover ways of weaning the
drunkard and the opium addict from the curse.
Women and students have a special opportunity in advancing
this reform. By many acts of loving service they can acquire on
addicts a hold which will compel them to listen to the appeal to give
up the evil habit.
Congress committees can open recreation booths where the tired
labourer will rest his limbs, get healthy and cheap refreshments, and
find suitable games. All this work is fascinating and uplifting. The358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHInon-violent approach to swaraj is a novel approach. In it old values
give place to new. In the violent way such reforms may find no place.
Believers in that way, in their impatience and, shall I say, ignorance,
put off such things to the day of deliverance. They forget that lasting
and healthy deliverance comes from within, i.e., from self-
purification. Constructive workers make legal prohibition easy and
successful even if they do not pave the way for it.
4. KHADI
Khadi is a controversial subject. Many people think that in
advocating khadi I am sailing against a headwind and am sure to sink
the ship of swaraj and that I am taking the country to the dark ages. I
do not propose to argue the case for khadi in this brief survey. I have
argued it sufficiently elsewhere. Here I want to show what every
Congressman, and for that matter every Indian, can do to advance the
cause of khadi. It connotes the beginning of economic freedom and
equality of all in the country. The proof of the pudding is in the
eating. Let everyone try, and he or she will find out for himself or
herself the truth of what I am saying. Khadi must be taken with all its
implications. It means a wholesale swadeshi mentality, a determination
to find all the necessaries of life in India and that too through the
labour and intellect of the villagers. That means a reversal of the
existing process. That is to say that, instead of half a dozen cities of
India and Great Britain living on the exploitation and the ruin of the
7,00,000 villages of India, the latter will be largely self-contained, and
will voluntarily serve the cities of India and even the outside world in
so far as it benefits both the parties.
This needs a revolutionary change in the mentality and tastes of
many. Easy though the non-violent way is in many respects, it is very
difficult in many others. It vitally touches the life of every single
Indian, makes him feel aglow with the possession of a power that has
lain hidden within himself, and makes him proud of his identity with
every drop of the ocean of Indian humanity. This non-violence is not
the inanity for which we have mistaken it through all these long ages;
it is the most potent force as yet known to mankind and on which its
very existence is dependent. It is that force which I have tried to
present to the Congress and through it to the world. Khadi to me is the
symbol of unity of Indian humanity, of its economic freedom and
equality and, therefore, ultimately, in the poetic expression of Jawa-
harlal Nehru, “the livery of India’s freedom”
Moreover, khadi mentality means decentralization of the pro-
duction and distribution of the necessaries of life. Therefore, the for-VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 359mula so far evolved is, every village to produce all its necessaries and a
certain percentage in addition for the requirements of the cities.
Heavy industries will needs be centralized and nationalized. But
they will occupy the least part of the vast national activity which will
mainly be in the villages.
Having explained the implications of khadi, I must indicate what
Congressmen can and should do towards its promotion. Production of
khadi includes cotton-growing, picking, ginning, cleaning, carding,
slivering, spinning, sizing, dyeing, preparing the warp and the woof,
weaving, and washing. These, with the exception of dyeing, are essen-
tial processes. Every one of them can be effectively handled in the
villages and is being so handled in many villages throughout India,
which the A.I.S.A. is covering. According to the latest report the
following are the interesting figures :
2,75,146 villagers, including 19,654 Harijans and 57,378 Mus-
lims, scattered in at least 13,451 villages, received, as spinners, weavers,
etc., Rs. 34,85,609 in 1940. The spinners were largely women.
Yet the work done is only one-hundredth part of what could be
done if Congressmen honestly took up the khadi programme. Since
the wanton destruction of this central village industry and the allied
handicrafts, intelligence and brightness have fled from the villages,
leaving them inane, lustreless, and reduced almost to the state of their
ill-kept cattle.
If Congressmen will be true to the Congress call in respect of
khadi, they will carry out the instructions of the A. I. S. A. issued
from time to time as to the part they can play in khadi planning. Only
a few broad rules can be laid down here :
1.Every family with a plot of ground can grow cotton at least
for family use. Cotton-growing is an easy process. In Bihar the
cultivators were by law compelled to grow indigo on 3/20 of their
cultivable land. This was in the interest of the foreign indigo planter.
Why cannot we grow cotton voluntarily for the nation on a certain
portion of our land? The reader will note that decentralization
commences from the beginning of khadi processes. Today cotton
crop is centralized and has to be sent to distant parts of India. Before
the war it used to be sent principally to Britain and Japan. It was and
still is a money crop and, therefore, subject to the fluctuations of the
market. Under the khadi scheme cotton-growing becomes free from
this uncertainty and gamble. The grower grows what he needs. The
farmer needs to know that his first business is to grow for his own
needs. When he does that, he will reduce the chance of a low market
ruining him.360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI2.Every spinner would buy—if he has not his own—enough
cotton for ginning, which he can easily do without the hand-ginning
roller frame. He can gin his own portion with a board and an       
iron rolling-pin. Where this is considered impracticable, hand-ginned
cotton should be bought and carded. Carding for self can be done
well on a tiny bow without much effort. The greater the decentra-
lization of labour, the simpler and cheaper the tools. The slivers made,
the process of spinning commences. I strongly recommend the
dhanush takli . I have used it frequently. My speed on it is almost the
same as on the wheel. I draw a finer thread and the strength and the
evenness of the yarn are greater on the dhanush takli than on the
wheel. This may not, however, hold good for all. My emphasis on the
dhanush takli  is based on the fact that it is more easily made, is
cheaper than and does not require frequent repairs like the wheel.
Unless one knows how to make the two mals1 and to adjust them when
they slip or to put the wheel right when it refuses to work, the wheel
has often to lie idle. Moreover, if the millions take to spinning at once,
as they well may have to,2 the dhanush takli,  being the instrument
most easily made and handled, is the only that can meet the demand.
It is more easily made even than the simple takli. The best, easiest and
cheapest way is to make it oneself. Indeed one ought to learn how to
handle and make simple tools. Imagine the unifying and educative
effect of the whole nation simultaneously taking part in the processes
up to spinning ! Consider the levelling effect of the bond of common
labour between the rich and the poor !
Yarn thus produced may be used in three ways : by presenting it
to the A.I.S.A. for the sake of the poor, by having it woven for
personal use, or by getting as much khadi for it as it can buy. It is
clear enough that the finer and better the yarn the greater will be its
value. If Congressmen will put their hearts into the work, they will
make improvements in the tools and make many discoveries. In our
country there has been a divorce between labour and intelligence. The
result has been stagnation. If there is an indissoluble marriage between
the two, and that in the manner here suggested, the resultant good will
be inestimable.
In this scheme of nationwide spinning as a sacrifice, I do not
expect the average man or woman to give more than one hour daily to
this work.

2 The first edition here has, “even under the stress of war”.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 3615. OTHER VILLAGE INDUSTRIES
These stand on a different footing from khadi. There is not
much scope for voluntary labour in them. Each industry will take the
labour of only a certain number of hands. These industries come in as
a handmaid to khadi. They cannot exist without khadi, and khadi will
be robbed of its dignity without them. Village economy cannot be
complete without the essential village industries such as hand-grind-
ing, hand-pounding, soap-making, paper-making, match-making,
tanning, oil-pressing, etc. Congressmen can interest themselves in
these and, if they are villagers or will settle down in villages, they will
give these industries a new life and a new dress. All should make it a
point of honour to use only village articles whenever and wher-ever
available. Given the demand there is no doubt that most of our wants
can be supplied from our villages. When we have become village-
minded , we will not want imitations of the West or machine-made
products, but we will develop a true national taste in keeping with the
vision of a new India in which pauperism, starvation and idleness will
be unknown.
6. VILLAGE SANITATION
Divorce between intelligence and labour has resulted in criminal
negligence of the villages. And so, instead of having graceful hamlets
dotting the land, we have dung-heaps. The approach to many villages
is not a refreshing experience. Often one would like to shut one’s
eyes and stuff one’s nose; such is the surrounding dirt and offending
smell. If the majority of Congressmen were derived from our villages,
as they should be, they should be able to make our villages models of
cleanliness in every sense of the word. But they have never considered
it their duty to identify themselves with the villagers in their daily
lives. A sense of national or social sanitation is not a virtue among us.
We may take a kind of a bath, but we do not mind dirtying the well or
the tank or river by whose side or in which we perform ablutions. I
regard this defect as a great vice which is responsible for the
disgraceful state of our villages and the sacred banks of the sacred
rivers and for diseases that spring from insanitation.
7. NEW OR BASIC EDUCATION
This is a new subject. But the members of the Working
Committee felt so much interested in it that gave a charter to the
organizers of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh which has been function-
ing since the Haripura session1. This is a big field of work for many
1 Of the Congress in 1938362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHICongressmen. This education is meant to transform village children
into model villagers. It is principally designed for them. The
inspiration for it has come from the villages. Congressmen who want
to build up the structure of swaraj from its very foundation dare not
neglect the children. Foreign rule has unconsciously, though none the
less surely, begun with the children in the field of education. Primary
education is a farce designed without regard to the wants of the India
of the villages and for that matter even of the cities. Basic education
links the children, whether of the cities or the villages, to all that is best
and lasting in India. It develops both the body and the mind, and
keeps the child rooted to the soil with a glorious vision of the future,
in the realization of which he or she begins to take his or her share
from the very commencement of his or her career in school.
Congressmen would find it of absorbing interest benefiting themselves
equally with the children with whom they come in contact. Let those
who wish put themselves in touch with the Secretary of the Sangh at
Sevagram.
8. ADULT EDUCATION
This has been woefully neglected by Congressmen. Where they
have not neglected it, they have been satisfied with teaching illiterates
to read and write. If I had charge of adult education, I should begin
with opening the minds of the adult pupils to the greatness and
vastness of their country. The villager’s India is contained in his
village. If he goes to another village, he talks of his own village as his
home. Hindustan is for him a geographical term. We have no notion
of the ignorance prevailing in the villages. The villagers know nothing
of foreign rule and its evils. What little knowledge they have picked
up fills them with the awe the foreigner inspires. The result is the
dread and hatred of the foreigner and his rule. They do not know how
to get rid of it. They do not know that the foreigner’s presence is due
to their own weaknesses and their ignorance of the power they possess
to rid themselves of the foreign rule. My adult education means,
therefore, first, true political education of the adult by word of mouth.
Seeing that this will be mapped out, it can be given without fear. I
imagine that it is too late in the day for authority to interfere with this
type of education; but if there is interference, there must be a fight for
this elementary right without which there can be no swaraj. Of course,
in all I have written, openness has been assumed. Non-violence abhors
fear and, therefore, secrecy. Side by side with the education by the
mouth will be the literary education. This is itself a speciality. Many
methods are being tried in order to shorten the period of education. A
temporary or permanent board of experts may be appointed by theVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 363Working Committee to give shape to the idea here adumbrated and
guide the workers. I admit that what I have said in this paragraph only
points the way but does not tell the average Congressman how to go
about it. Nor is every Congressman fitted for this highly special work.
But Congressmen who are teachers should find no difficulty in laying
down a course in keeping with the suggestions made herein.
9. WOMEN
I have included service of women in the constructive pro-
gramme, for though satyagraha has automatically brought India’s
women out from their darkness as nothing else could have in such an
incredibly short space of time, Congressmen have not felt the call to
see that women become equal partners in the fight for swaraj. They
have not realized that woman must be the true helpmate of man in the
mission of service. Woman has been suppressed under custom and law
for which man was responsible and in the shaping of which she had
no hand. In a plan of life based on non-violence, woman has as much
right to shape her own destiny as man has to shape his. But as every
right in a non-violent society proceeds from the previous performance
of a duty, it follows that rules of social conduct must be framed by
mutual co-operation and consultation. They can never be imposed
from outside. Men have not realized this truth in its fulness in their
behaviour towards women. They have considered themselves to be
lords and masters of women instead of considering them as their
friends and co-workers. It is the privilege of Congressmen to give the
women of India a lifting hand. Women are in the position somewhat
of the slave of old who did not know that he could or ever had to be
free. And when freedom came, for the moment he felt helpless.
Women have been taught to regard themselves as slaves of men. It is
up to Congressmen to see that they enable them to realize their full
status and play their part as equals of men.
This revolution is easy, if the mind is made up. Let Congress-
men begin with their own homes. Wives should not be dolls and
objects of indulgence, but should be treated as honoured comrades in
common service. To this end those who have not received a liberal
education should receive such instruction as is possible from their
husbands. The same observation applies, with the necessary changes,
to mothers and daughters.
It is hardly necessary to point out that I have given a onesided
picture of the helpless state of India’s women. I am quite conscious of
the fact that in the villages generally they hold their own with their
menfolk and in some respects even rule them. But to the impartial364 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIoutsider the legal and customary status of woman is bad enough
throughout and demands radical alteration.
10. EDUCATION IN HEALTH AND HYGIENE
Having given a place to village sanitation, the question may be
asked why give a separate place to education in health and hygiene? It
might have been bracketed with sanitation, but I did not wish to
interfere with the items. Mention of mere sanitation is not enough to
include health and hygiene. The art of keeping one’s health and the
knowledge of hygiene is by itself a separate subject of study and
corresponding practice. In a well-ordered society the citizens know
and observe the laws of health and hygiene. It is established beyond
doubt that ignorance and neglect of the laws of health and hygiene
are responsible for the majority of diseases to which mankind is heir.
The very high death-rate among us is no doubt due largely to our
gnawing poverty, but it could be mitigated if the people were properly
educated about health and hygiene.
Mens sana in corpore sano  is perhaps the first law for humanity.
A healthy mind in a healthy body is a self-evident truth. There is an
inevitable connection between mind and body. If we were in
possession of healthy minds, we would shed all violence and, naturally
obeying the laws of health, we would have healthy bodies without an
effort. I hope, therefore, that no Congressman will disregard this item
of the constructive programme. The fundamental laws of health and
hygiene are simple and easily learnt. The difficulty is about their
observance. Here are some :
Think the purest thoughts and banish all idle and impure
thoughts.
Breathe the freshest air day and night.
Establish a balance between bodily and mental work.
Stand erect, sit erect, and be neat and clean in every one of your
acts, and let these be an expression of your inner condition.
Eat to live for service of fellow-men. Do not live for indulging
yourselves. Hence your food must be just enough to keep your mind
and body in good order. Man becomes what he eats.
Your water, food and air must be clean, and you will not be
satisfied with mere personal cleanliness, but you will infect your
surroundings with the same threefold cleanliness that you will desire
for yourselves.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 36511. PROVINCIAL LANGUAGES1
Our love of the English language in preference to our own
mother tongue has caused a deep chasm between the educated and
politically-minded classes and the masses. The languages of India
have suffered impoverishment. We flounder when we make the vain
attempt to express abstruse thought in the mother tongue. There are
no equivalents for scientific terms. The result has been disastrous. The
masses remain cut off from the modern mind. We are too near our
own times correctly to measure the disservice caused to India by this
neglect of its great languages. It is easy enough to understand that
unless we undo the mischief the mass mind must remain imprisoned.
The masses can make no solid contribution to the construction of
swaraj. It is inherent in swaraj based on non-violence that every
individual makes his own direct contribution to the Independence
movement. The masses cannot do this fully unless they understand
every step with all its implications. This is impossible unless every step
is explained in their own languages.
12. NATIONAL LANGUAGE
And then for all-India intercourse we need, from among the
Indian stock, a language which the largest number of people already
know and understand and which the others can easily pick up. This
language is indisputably Hindi. It is spoken and understood by both
Hindus and Muslims of the North. It is called Urdu when it is written
in the Urdu character. The Congress, in its famous resolution passed at
the Cawnpore session in 1925, called this all-India speech Hindustani.
And since that time, in theory at least, Hindustani has been the
Rashtra-bhasha . I say “in theory” because even Congressmen have
not practised it as they should have.2 In 1920 a deliberate attempt was
begun to recognize the importance of Indian languages for the
political education of the masses, as also of an all-India common
speech which politically-minded India could easily speak and which
Congressmen from the different provinces could understand at all-
India gatherings of the Congress. Such national language should
enable one to understand and speak both forms of speech and write in
both the scripts.
I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have failed to
carry out that resolution. And so we have, in my opinion, the shameful
1 In the first edition this and the following topic are discussed under the
heading “Propaganda of Rashtrabhasha”.
2 The first edition here adds : “The picture that I have drawn in this paragraph is
true to life as it was before 1920.”366 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIspectacle of Congressmen insisting on speaking in English and
compelling others to do likewise for their sakes. The spell that English
has cast on us is not yet broken. Being under it, we are impeding the
progress of India towards her goal. Our love of the masses must be
skin-deep, if we will not take the trouble of spending over learning
Hindustani as many months as the years we spend over learning
English.1
13. ECONOMIC EQUALITY
This last is the master-key to non-violent independence. Work-
ing for economic equality means abolishing the eternal conflict
between capital and labour. It means the levelling down of the few
rich in whose hands is concentrated the bulk of the nation’s wealth on
the one hand, and the levelling up of the semi-starved naked millions
on the other. A non-violent system of government is clearly an
impossibility so long as the wide gulf between the rich and the hungry
millions persists. The contrast between the palaces of New Delhi and
the miserable hovels of the poor labouring class nearby cannot last
one day in a free India in which the poor will enjoy the same power as
the richest in the land. A violent and bloody revolution is a certainty
one day unless there is a voluntary abdication of riches and the power
that riches give and sharing them for the common good.
I adhere to my doctrine of trusteeship in spite of the ridicule
that has been poured upon it. It is true that it is difficult to reach. So is
non-violence. But we made up our minds in 1920 to negotiate that
steep ascent. We have found it worth the effort. It involves a daily
growing appreciation of the working of non-violence. It is expected
that Congrssmen will make a diligent search and reason out for
themselves the why and the wherefore of 2 non-violence. They should
ask themselves how the existing inequalities can be abolished violently
or non-violently. I think we know the violent way. It has not
succeeded anywhere.3
1  The first edition here has the following additional paragraph: “Love of one’s
own language: I need hardly add anything to what I have said in the foregoing
paragraph.  The two propositions hang together for those who view India as one
country.”
2 The first edition has after this: “what they are called upon to do,” and adds:
 “They may not be satisfied with the mere conformity, honest or half-hearted,
with the instructions issued from time to time.”
3 The first edition here adds: “Some claim that it has in Russia in a large
measure.  I doubt it.  It is too early to make an unchallengeable claim.  And now that
the war has broken out between Russia and Germany, we are unable to say what the
ultimate result will be.”VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 367This non-violent experiment is still in the making. We have
nothing much yet to show by way of demonstration. It is certain,
however, that the method has begun to work though ever so slowly in
the direction of equality. And since non-violence is a process of
conversion, the conversion, if achieved, must be permanent. A society
or a nation constructed non-violently must be able to withstand attack
upon its structure from without or within. We have moneyed
Congressmen in the organization. They have to lead the way. This
fight1 provides an opportunity for the closest heart-searching on the
part of every individual Congressman. If ever we are to achieve
equality, the foundation has to be laid now. Those who think that
major reforms will come after the advent of swaraj are deceiving
themselves as to the elementary working of non-violent swaraj. It will
not drop from heaven all of a sudden one fine morning. But it has to
be built up brick by brick by corporate self-effort. We have travelled a
fair way in that direction. But a much longer and weary distance has
to be covered before we can behold swaraj in its glorious majesty.
Every Congressman has to ask himself what he has done towards the
attainment of economic equality.
14. KISANS2
The programme is not exhaustive. Swaraj is a mighty structure.
Eighty crores of hands have to work at building it.3 Of these kisans,
i.e., the peasantry, are the largest part. In fact, being the bulk of them
(probably over 80%) the kisans should be the Congress. But they are
not. When they become conscious of their non-violent strength, no
power on earth can resist them.
1 The first edition here adds, “which is conceived as the last.”
2 In the first edition this and the succeeding two topics, viz., “Labour” and
“Students”, are discussed under a single heading “Kisan, Labour and Students”, which
begins as follows: “I have now finished the inquiry about the thirteen items of the
constructive programme.  I have attempted to show how each item fits in with the
scheme of swaraj and how it can be worked by individual Congressmen.
3 The first edition here has: “Therefore, many other items of a piece with the
thirteen can be added, the centre being always the charkha round which all other
activities should come from the charkha.
“The reader will notice, as some of my co-workers have noticed, the absence
of any reference of kisans, factory hands or labour and students.  I have deliberately
avoided reference to their work as parts of the constructive programme.  They have to
work the thirteen items same as any other worker in the cause.  My avoidance is not
intended to belittle the part they can play in the movement. I am quite conscious of
the great importance they have in the movement for freedom.  The question
underlying the inquiry is who is to organize them and how.”368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThey must not be used for power politics.1 I consider it to be
contrary to the non-violent method. Those who would know my
method of organizing kisans may profitably study the movement in
Champaran when satyagraha was tried for the first time in India with
the result all India knows. It became a mass movement which
remained wholly non-violent from start to finish. It affected over
twenty lakhs of kisans. The struggle centred round one specific
grievance which was a century old. There had been several violent
revolts to get rid of the grievance. The kisans were suppressed. The
non-violent remedy succeeded in full in six months. The kisans of
Champaran became politically conscious without any direct effort.
The tangible proof they had of the working of non-violence to
remove their grievances drew them to the Congress and led by Babu
Brijkishore Prasad and Babu Rajendra Prasad they gave a good
account of themselves during the past civil disobedience campaigns.
The reader may also profitably study the kisan movements in
Kheda , Bardoli and Borsad . The secret of success lies in a refusal to
exploit the kisans for political purposes outside their own personal
and felt grievances. Organization round a specific wrong they
understand. They need no sermons on non-violence. Let them learn
to apply non-violence as an effective remedy which they can under-
stand, and later when they are told that the method they were applying
was non-violent, they readily recognize it as such.
Form these illustrations Congressmen who care could study how
work can be done for and among kisans. I hold that the method that
some Congressmen have followed to organize kisans has done them
no good and has probably harmed them. Anyway they have not used
the non-violent method. Be it said to the credit of some of these
workers that they frankly admit that they do not believe in the non-
violent method. My advice to such workers would be that they should
neither use the Congress name nor work as Congressmen.
The reader will now understand why I have refrained from the
competition to organize kisans and labour on an all-India basis. How I
wish that all hands pulled in the same direction ! But perhaps in a
huge country like ours it is impossible. Anyway, in non-violence there
is no coercion. Cold reason and demonstration of the working of non-
violence must be trusted to do the work.
In my opinion, like labour, they should have under the Congress a
department working for their specific questions.
1 The first edition here has: “About the kisan movement too, there is, I fear, an
ugly competition to use kisans for power politics.”VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 36915. LABOUR
Ahmedabad Labour Union is a model for all India to copy.1Its
basis is non-violence, pure and simple. It has never had a set-back in
its career. It has gone on from strength to strength without fuss and
without show. It has its hospital, its school for the children of the mill-
hands, its classes for adults, its own printing press and khadi depot,
and its own residential quarters. Almost all the hands are voters and
decide the fate of elections. They came on the voters’ list at the
instance of the Provincial Congress Committee. The organization has
never taken part in party politics of the Congress. It influences the
municipal  policy  of the city. It has to its credit very successful strikes
which were wholly non-violent. Mill-owners and labour have
governed their relations largely through voluntary arbitration. If I had
my way, I would regulate all the labour organizations of India after
the Ahmedabad model. It has never sought to intrude itself upon the
All-India Trade Union Congress and has been uninfluenced by that
Congress. A time, I hope, will come when it will be possible for the
Trade Union Congress to accept the Ahmedabad method and have the
Ahmedabad organization as part of the All-India Union. But I am in
no hurry. It will come in its own time.
16. ADIVASIS2
The term adivasi, like raniparaj3, is a coined word. Raniparaj
stands for kaliparaj  (meaning black people, though their skin is no
more black than that of any other). It was conined, I think, by Shri
Jugatram. The term adivasi (for Bhils, Gonds, or others variously
described as Hill Tribes or aboriginals) means literally original
inhabitants and was coined, I believe, by Thakkar Bapa.
Service of adivasis is also a part of the constructive programme.
Though they are the sixteenth number in this programme, they are
not the least in point of importance. Our country is so vast and the
races so varied that the best of us cannot know all there is to know of
men and their condition. As one discovers this for oneself, one
realizes how difficult it is to make good our claim    to be   one nation,
1 The first edition here has : “As to labour, I am responsible for the
organization of Ahmedabad labour. I am of the opinion that it is a model for all India
to copy.”
2 The first edition does not have this and the following topic.
3  “Forest people”370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIunless every unit has a living consciousness of being one with every
other.
The adivasis are over two crores in all India. Bapa began work
among the Bhils years ago in Gujarat. In about 1940 Shri Balasaheb
Kher threw himself with his usual zeal into this much-needed service
in the Thana District. He is now President of the Adivasi Seva Mandal.
There are several such other workers in other parts of India and
yet are too few. Truly, “the harvest is rich but the labourers are few”.
Who can deny that all such service is not merely humanitarian but
solidly national, and brings us nearer to true independence?
17. LEPERS
Leper is a word of bad odour. India is perhaps a home of lepers
next only to Central Africa. Yet they are as much a part of society as
the tallest among us. But the tall absorb our attention though they are
least in need of it. The lot of the lepers who are much in need of
attention is studied neglect. I am tempted to call it heartless, which it
certainly is in terms of non-violence. It is largely the missionary who,
be it said to his credit, bestows care on him. The only institution run
by an Indian, as a pure labour of love, is by Shri Manohar Diwan near
Wardha. It is working under the inspiration and guidance of Shri
Vinoba Bhave. If India was pulsating with new life, if we were all in
earnest about winning independence in the quickest manner possible
by truthful and non-violent means, there would not be a leper or
beggar in India uncared for and unaccounted for. In this revised
edition I am deliberately introducing the leper as a link in the chain of
constructive effort. For what the leper is in India, that we are, if we put
look about us, for the modern civilized world. Examine the condition
of our brethren across the ocean and the truth of my remark will be
borne home to us.
18. STUDENTS
I have reserved students to the last. I have always cultivated close
contact with them. They know me and I know them. They have given
me service. Many ex-collegians are my esteemed co-workers. I know
that they are the hope of the future. In the heyday of non-co-
operation they were invited to leave their schools and colleges. Some
professors and students who responded to the Congress call have
remained steadfast and gained much for the country and themselves.
The call has not been repeated for there is not the atmosphere for it.
But experience has shown that the lure of the current education,
though it is false and unnatural, is too much for the youth of theVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 371country. College education provides a career. It is a passport for
entrance to the charmed circle. Pardonable hunger for knowledge
cannot be satisfied otherwise than by going through the usual rut.
They do not mind the waste of precious years in acquiring knowledge
of an utterly foreign language which takes the place of the mother
tongue. The sin of it is never felt. They and their teachers have made
up their minds that the indigenous languages are useless for gaining
access to modern thought and the modern sciences. I wonder how the
Japanese are faring. For their education, I understand, is all given in
Japanese. The Chinese Generalissimo knows very little, if anything, of
English.
But such as the students are, it is from these young men and
women that the future leaders of the nation are to rise. Unfortunately
they are acted upon by every variety of influences. Non-violence
offers them little attraction. A blow for a blow or two for one is an
easily understandable proposition. It seems to yield immediate result
though momentary. It is a never-ending trial of brute strength as we
see in time of war among brutes or among human beings. Appre-
ciation of non-violence means patient research and still more patient
and difficult practice. I have not entered the list of competitors for the
students’ hand, for the reasons that have dictated my course about
kisans and labour. But I am myself a fellow-student, using the word in
its broader sense. My university is different from theirs. They have a
standing invitation from me to come to my university and join me in
my search. Here are the terms :
1.Students must not take part in party politics. They are
students, searchers, not politicians.
2.They may not resort to political strikes. They must have
their heroes, but their devotion to them is to be shown by copying the
best in their heroes, not by going on strikes, if the heroes are
imprisoned or die or are even sent to the gallows. If their grief is
unbearable and if all the students feel equally, schools or colleges may
be closed on such occasions, with the consent of their principals. If the
principals will not listen, it is open to the students to leave their
institutions in a becoming manner till the managers repent and recall
them. On no account may they use coercion against dissentients of
against the authorities. They must have the confidence that if they are
united and dignified in their conduct, they are sure to win.
3.They must all do sacrificial spinning in a scientific manner.
Their tools shall be always neat, clean, and in good order and       
condition. If possible, they will learn to make them themselves. Their
yarn will naturally be of the highest quality. They will study the372 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIliterature about spinning with all its economic, social, moral and
political implications.
4.They will be khadi-users all through and use village pro-
ducts to the exclusion of all analogous things, foreign or machine
made.
5.They may not impose Vandemataram  or the national flag
on others. They may wear national flag buttons on their own persons
but not force others to do the same.
6.They can enforce the message of the tricolour flag in their
own persons and harbour neither communalism nor untouchability in
their hearts. They will cultivate real friendship with students of other
faiths and with Harijans as if they were their own kith and kin.
7.They will make it a point to give first aid to their injured
neighbours and do scavenging and cleaning in the neighbouring
villages and instruct village children and adults.
8.They will learn the national language, Hindustani, in its
present double dress, two forms of speech and two scripts, so that they
may feel at home whether Hindi or Urdu is spoken and Nagari or
Urdu script is written.
9.They will translate into their own mother tongue everything
new they may learn, and transmit it in their weekly rounds to the
surrounding villages.
10. They will do nothing in secret, they will be above board in
all their dealings, they will lead a pure life of self-restraint, shed all
fear and be always ready to protect their weak fellow-students, and be
ready to quell riots by non-violent conduct at the risk of their lives.
And when the final heat of the struggle comes, they will leave their
institutions and, if need be, sacrifice themselves for the freedom of
their country.
11. They will be scrupulously correct and chivalrous in their
behaviour towards their girl fellow-students.
For working out the programme I have sketched for them, the
students must find time. I know that they waste a great deal of time in
idleness. By strict economy, they can save many hours. But I do not
want to put an undue strain upon any student. I would, therefore,
advise patriotic students to lose one year, not at a stretch but spread it
over their whole study. They will find that one year so given will not
be a waste of time. The effort will add to their equipment, mental,
moral and physical, and they will have made even during their studies
a substantial contribution to the freedom movement.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 373PLACE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
I have said in these pages that civil disobedience is not
absolutely necessary to win freedom through purely non-violent
effort, if the co-operation of the whole nation is secured in the
constructive programme. But such good luck rarely favours nations or
individuals. Therefore, it is necessary to know the place of civil
disobedience in a nationwide non-violent effort.
It has three definite functions :
1.It can be effectively offered for the redress of a local wrong.
2.It can be offered without regard to effect, though aimed at a
particular wrong or evil, by way of self-immolation in order to rouse
local consciousness or conscience. Such was the case in Champaran
when I offered civil disobedience without any regard to the effect and
well knowing that even the people might remain apathetic. That it
proved otherwise may be taken, according to taste, as God’s grace or a
stroke of good luck.
3.In the place of full response to constructive effort, it can be
offered as it was in 19411. Though it was a contribution to and part of
the battle for freedom, it was purposely centred round a particular
issue, i.e., free speech. Civil disobedience can never be directed for a
general cause such as for independence. The issue must be definite
and capable of being clearly understood and within the power of the
opponent to yield. This method properly applied must lead to the
final goal.
I have not examined here the full scope and possibilities of civil
disobedience. I have touched enough of it to enable the reader to
understand the connection between the constructive programme and
civil disobedience. In the first two cases, no elaborate constructive
programme was or could be necessary. But when civil disobedience is
itself devised for the attainment of independence, previous preparation
is necessary, and it has to be backed by the visible and conscious
effort of those who are engaged in the battle. Civil disobedience is
thus a stimulation for the fighters and a challenge to the opponent. It
should be clear to the reader that civil disobedience in terms of
independence without the co-operation of the millions by way of
constructive effort is mere bravado and worse than useless.
CONCLUSION
This is not a thesis written on behalf of the Congress or at the
instance of the Central Office. It is the outcome of conversations I had
1 The first edition here has : “as it is being offered at present.”374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwith some co-workers in Sevagram. They had felt the want of some-
thing from my pen showing the connection between the constructive
programme and civil disobedience and how the former might be
worked. I have endeavoured to supply the want in this pamphlet. It
does not purport to be exhaustive, but it is sufficiently indicative of
the way the programme should be worked.
Let not the reader make the mistake of laughing at any of the
items as being part of the movement for independence. Many people
do many things, big and small, without connecting them with non-
violence or independence. They have then their limited value as
expected. The same man appearing as a civilian may be of no
consequence, but appearing in his capacity as General he is a big
personage, holding the lives of millions at his mercy. Similarly, the
charkha in the hands of a poor widow brings a paltry pice to her, in
the hands of a Jawaharlal it is an instrument of India’s freedom. It is
the office which gives the charkha its dignity. It is the office assigned
to the constructive programme which gives it an irresistible prestige
and power.
Such at least is my view. It may be that of a mad man. If it
makes no appeal to the Congressman, I must be rejected. For my
handling of civil disobedience without the constructive programme
will be like a paralysed hand attempting to lift a spoon.
Constructive Programme : Its Meaning and Place
622. THE PLACE OF SILK
Shri Jajuji writes :1
All these are good points. They have also been pretty well
discussed. But some questions are raised again and again and need to
be discussed again and again.
I shall answer the questions in the order in which they have been
asked.
(1)The question of violence and non-violence does arise, for
there is violent silk and non-violent silk. The best thing of course is
for people who like to consider everything from the point of view of
1 The letter is not translated here. Shrikrishnadas Jaju, Secretary, All-India
Spinners’ Association, had formulated the following views and sought Gandhiji’s
opinion on them : (1) Bearing in mind that sericulture involves violence, the worker
should give it at best secondary importance; (2) silk competes with fine khadi; (3) it
tends to make people luxury-loving; and (4) it calls for a much larger capital outlay.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 375non-violence to give up silk altogether.
But from the point of view of khadi we should not raise this
question. We should stock both kinds of silk in our bhandars, though
we should give encouragement only to non-violent silk.
(2)We should never allow silk to reach a point where it can
compete with khadi. The idea behind giving a place to silk was that it
should supplement khadi. It has also been the view that hand-spun silk
is always to be preferred to foreign silk and silk manufactured in
Indian mills. But silk must never be given the place of cotton cloth.
That is why a limit has been put upon the quantity of silk to be
stocked in khadi bhandars.
(3)This is not an important point. In a way even Andhra khadi,
coloured khadi and khadi with woven designs make us luxury-loving.
Khadi is as much for the fastidious as it is for the poor. From the very
beginning it has been our endeavour to introduce into khadi as much
beauty and decoration as we can. We display this at every khadi
exhibition. We have been showing progress in the appearance of
khadi every year. This was and still is the correct [attitude]. Khadi-
mindedness does not mean that art and design should have no place in
khadi, and that it is to be only the attire of the poor. Therefore the
restraint we should place on ourselves here is that we should put what
art and design we can into khadi and be satisfied. From this point of
view silk is to be and should be discarded. From this point of view too
we compare the fine Andhra khadi with silk. Then the silk-lovers say
they find silk cheaper than the Andhra khadi. I answer that we cannot
advance the work of khadi in this way. Khadi, though it may be costly,
comes out cheap in the end.
(4)If silk-making calls for twice as large a capital outlay, we
have a very strong reason for giving it up. But having regard to
human nature we do not or cannot wholly renounce silk. In our
definition of khadi we have given a place to hand-spun silk and hand-
spun wool. But we cannot encourage woollens and silk with a view to
increasing profits. There will have to be some restraint in regard to
these. Service of the millions is possible only through cotton khadi.

BARDOLI,

MY DEAR AMRITLAL,
Of course I will try to show you how utterly wrong you are. But
when a man believes in a different philosophy from the one another
subscribes to, it is difficult for that other to carry conviction. Such is
my plight.
You quote from the Bible but your application is quite new and
utterly selfish. You turn a donation into a debt. What is to be done? I
brought you out of Bengal because you were disgusted and now you
think that you did me a favour in coming out.
Of course a labourer is worthy of his hire. You want money
without work. And when you do work, you want more than the
highest you and I have agreed upon, viz., 8 as. for 8 hours’ work. But
you think you have a claim upon me, i.e., society, for Rs. 2-12 per
day for practically very little work. Let me not be misunderstood. I
know Abha is doing something, so also perhaps you. But your letter
shows that even if all of you were doing nothing, you will claim the
above amount as if it was a right. I suggest to you that you are wholly
wrong in making the claim and defending it on high morality. My
notion is different. I must not carry the argument any further.
God will give you light if you are humble and will seek it in the
right spirit.380 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIf my letter does not convince, you should wait till we can meet
some day, if ever we do. Meanwhile we must agree to differ.

CHI. CHANDAN,
I am glad that you wrote to me, though only from a selfish
motive.1 You would certainly have money in Baroda, but your Prince
may have to sell his soul there. Occasions may arise in Indian States
when, if you refuse to obey the State’s order, you would in no time
find yourself disgraced. That is why, when an opportunity arose
earlier, it was decided that a hundred rupees else-where would be
preferable to a lakh in an Indian State. You will not get elsewhere the
opportunity for service which you two have in Kashi. Did you not
know, when you decided to marry Shankar, that he was a poor man’s
son and had grown up in simplicity, that he was a man of self-respect
and that he would be prepared to sacrifice his all for the sake of his
honour? Yes, he might welcome comfort if he can have it by
straightforward means. Perhaps there is this difference between Kaka
and him.
See that you do not tempt Shankar. If he is patient, he will rise
where he is at present. What he earns is enough to meet your needs.
Have patience. Remember the line “Be equiminded in happiness and
suffering, for they are born with the body”, and let Shankar follow
his straight path.
You and Baby will be well. I have written at greater length than I
had intended. Of course I could not afford the time, but, then, it was
you !

638. SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING
BARDOLI,
December 17, 1941
I had received Jajuji’s letter2 many days ago. I liked many
things in the letter. But I feel that we should have some discussion on
the letter today. If I were to put down the things that Jajuji has said in
his letter, my language would have been a little different though the
substance would have been the same. The principles he has enunciated
are sound. It is another matter to what extent they can be put into
practice. But it is better that we clearly understand the principles.
When the principles have been clearly formulated we are able to look
at things in a uniform way. There is then no room left for disagree-
ments. If there is some slackness in practice we must put in more
1 Vide “Letter to Sultana Razia”, 25-11-1941.
2 Saying that khadi workers did not show the qualities of self-sacrifice and hard
work required of themVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 383effort. What else could we do but make the effort?
As Jajuji has pointed out, no matter how much khadi we
produce, if we have not understood the principles behind khadi, khadi
work is bound to languish. India wore khadi even before. Indeed, we
exported khadi to the biggest countries of the world. But we cannot
pride ourselves upon it today. Khadi then was not associated with
politics. Kings and officials, out of avarice, forced the poor to part
with khadi and sold it to make themselves rich. This makes it difficult
for us even today to explain khadi activity to the masses.
But today we agree that khadi is the means to our freedom. This
first occurred to me in 1908. The very thing that was a cause of our
slavery will open the door to our freedom. We have to understand this.
We have therefore based khadi on truth and non-violence. If we
forget it and think of producing khadi anyhow, a time will come when
we shall be burning khadi. No other constructive activity is so much
ridiculed and denounced as khadi. The coming of the mills has given
people all the more occasion to do so. In their own way they are
justified. Since khadi was there in the past, they ask, why did we
become slaves. How can we treat the same khadi as a means to our
freedom? It is the duty of the Sangh to answer them. This is the
question Jajuji has placed before us.
We have to produce khadi on a large scale. We also have to
think how. But if we forget truth and non-violence, no matter how
much khadi we may produce, we shall lose it in the end. If we do not
hold on to the basic thing, impurities will creep in. Khadi workers
should therefore see that the whole khadi business is kept pure. Today
when we contemplate producing khadi on a mass scale we ought not
to forget the basic thing. Today I shall not say that all our spinners
too should understand truth and non-violence. But I must say this
about our 3,000 workers. If they do not abide by truth and non-
violence we shall sink. Shri Bharatanandaji has formulated a
graduated plan to provide for meeting the demand of khadi for the
whole of India at the end of ten years. Today the plan is a mere set of
figures on paper. But it can be turned into reality. How is it possible,
however, if we do not find good workers? If we but make up our
minds we can become really good workers. Jajuji is right in giving this
matter the first place. The question before us is: ‘How can we produce
such workers?’ If we are always awake we shall develop the spirit of
non-violence and self-sacrifice. Even a votary of violence is capable
of self-sacrifice. Hitler too is said to be self-sacrificing. He is violence
incarnate. It is said he is a vegetarian. I find it difficult to imagine384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhow, if he is one, he is able to countenance so much slaughter.
Anyway, his is said to be a life of self-sacrifice. He has no vices. He
has not married. His character is said to be clean. He is always alert.
What we require is both self-sacrifice and non-violence. Non-violence
means love. First the chief workers should manifest it. We may begin
with myself, then Jajuji and then the members of the Council. Let us
be vigilant and alert. Our example is bound to influence the workers,
even if unconsciously. Then we shall be able to make ourselves free of
doubts and fears about khadi. It does not matter if our speed is slow.
We must never renounce the principles we have evolved. If we do not
forsake them, we are bound to be successful.1
The question of a living wage is a difficult one.2 I myself have
not been able to form any opinion on it. If I come across a man who
is good and qualified I should be tempted. I shouldn’t want to lose
him. If we frame a certain rule then we must follow that rule. I have
been trying to frame some rule. But we must confess that at the
moment we are helpless. We cannot frame a rule which will make it
difficult for us to find workers. To make such a rule would mean that
we do not move with the times. We shall thereby even lose the ability
to pay a wage of three annas to each spinner. It is true and just that if
we pay spinners three annas we should ourselves learn to live on three
annas. Today we are taking many times more than what the spinners
get. Even the lowest paid worker amongst us receives many times
more. But I must confess with shame that this disparity has put us in
difficulties. However, I have no satisfactory solution.

BARDOLI,
December 19, 1941
As the war approaches the Indian border, people begin to get
scared. I have a typical letter from Assam and others from various
parts. They expect guidance from me as a war-resister and director of
satyagraha.
So far as satyagraha is concerned, in areas such as Assam
responsible Congressmen should not offer satyagraha but should
devote themselves to steadying those who are under Congress
influence.
As to the guidance of those who would listen to the Congress or
me, the people will presently have directions from the Working
Committee.
But so far as I am concerned, I am quite clear that the people
should refuse to be scared even though bombs may be dropped in
their midst. For the time being at any rate the danger is to be expected
only in the big cities. Those who do not wish to run any risk would do
well quietly to leave their cities.
It is wrong to make a rush on every scare and crowd the railway
stations. The railway staff cannot possibly cope with sudden rushes. It
is unmanly to rush for saving oneself. A wise and brave man will wait
till the last man is safely out. What I have said applies to all Con-
gressmen and others. I would not like it to be said of us as a nation
that we run about like mad men on the approach of the slightest
danger. We must face bravely any situation that may befall us.
Congressmen who are war-resisters will remain at their posts and
offer such assistance to the people as is within their power. They will
run, at any risk, to the help of those who may be injured.
Whilst I have been and am still against Congressmen joining
A.R.P., I have never thought or suggested that Congressmen should
leave points of danger or fields of service.386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIt is not necessary to belong to any Government organization to
be able to render effective service without expectation of reward or
praise.
The chief thing is to preserve complete equanimity, no matter
what danger faces us. This is especially so for those who are
warresisters and fear no enemy.

I have been asked for a brief statement on the entry of America
in the war. It is not possible for me to join the chorus of current
opinion. I cannot welcome this entry of America. American tradition
singles her out as an arbitrator and mediator between the warring
nations. By her territorial vastness, amazing energy, unrivalled finan-
cial status and owing to the composite character of her people she is
the one country which could have saved the world from the
unthinkable butchery that is going on.
I do not know whether America could have avoided the entry. I
have no data for giving a decisive opinion on the question. I have
only expressed my fervent wish that it might have been possible for
her to play her natural part. It is tragic to contemplate that with
America as party to the war there is no great Power left which can
mediate and bring about peace for which I have no doubt the peoples
of all lands are thirsting. It is a strange phenomenon that the human
wish is paralysed by the creeping effect of the war fever.

CHI. VIJAYA,
I have your letter. Your mother and brother were here only
yesterday. I also would have been happy if you had been here.
Nothing is certain about Ahmedabad. I shall let you know if I decide
to go. It is enough for me that you are quietly doing your work there.
Ba has been slightly ill. She is better now. Mahadev has gone to Unai
with Durga, but she has taken ill there. There is no cause for worry.
Tell Nanabhai that Bhai Vithaldas Jerajani wishes to join the Kathiawar
Khadi Committee. They should take him and inform him, and invite
him to attend when a meeting is called.

I have your letter. You can introduce this change immediately.
The telephone cabin should be located outside the office, so that the
telephone would be accessible even when the office is closed and the
cabin should be so fitted that the receiver could be picked up from
inside the office and the telephone used whenever necessary. If it can
be shifted outside the dak-room, there would be sufficient accommo-

There are so many sick persons in the Ashram. Why do you not treat
them? If a man or a woman falls ill I cannot send you to attend to the
patient. So far as I know you do nothing at Khurja, either. You have
given me to understand that you can do nothing until the house is
ready. Where there are houses already you will not work. Do you
follow what I Mean? I have a moral responsibility towards you. It irks
me that I cannot give a satisfactory account to people about you.

651. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
BARDOLI,
December 27, 1941
The action of the Bihar Government in banning the meeting of
the Hindu Mahasabha has always appeared to me to be inexplicable.2
Those who had proclaimed their desire to hold the meeting were
responsible men and, what is more, so far as I am aware, trusted by the
Central Government and known to be pro-Government. They had and
have identified themselves with the war effort. Why such people could
not be trusted by the Bihar Provincial Government to behave decently
passes my comprehension. I see that Vir Savarkar3 had accommodated
the Bihar authorities to the extent of postponing the session with a
view to coming to an understanding.
When all attempts at a settlement failed, civil resistance was the
only remedy open to the suppressed Hindu Mahasabha. And I must
confess it fills me with delight to find Vir Savarkar, Dr. Moonje and
other leaders being arrested4 in their attempt to assert the very primary
and very fundamental right of holding an orderly meeting subject to
all reasonable restrictions about the preservation of the public peace. I
observe that even Dr. Shyama
         Prasad, the new Finance Minister of the Bengal Government, has
successfully courted arrest by committing the same honourable
offence that his colleagues have committed. I congratulate the leaders
of the Sabha on their dignified and peaceful protest against the utterly
arbitrary action of the Bihar Government. There is surely something

2 The Bihar Government had banned the annual session of the Hindu

to avoid the possibility of communal clashes” at the time of Bakr-id.

results. Let me hope that this action of the Bihar Government has
brought the Hindus and Muslims of Bihar, and even all India, together
on the common platform of human liberty. For I am quite sure that
the Muslim League could not possibly wish the denial to their sister
organization of a liberty which they could claim for themselves. I
hope that there will be only one end to this Bihar episode, viz., lifting
of the ban on the Hindu Mahasabha and the men who are imprisoned
today holding their session without let or hindrance.

clear that the difference between the Committee and me should be

on other grounds than those of non-violence, they ought to be clearly
stated. If we can under certain circumstances they should be defined.
The scope of Congress non-violence should also be defined.

[On or before December 30, 1940 ]2
So far as I am concerned, even if I was given the utmost power
conceivable, even if I was made the Viceroy of India today, would I
ask the people of India to take up the sword to keep the Empire alive?
I for one should feel that I was committing moral suicide in that I
would be abandoning the faith of a lifetime, the faith which I had
persuaded the Congress to accept for twenty years as a policy. The
steady unflinching pursuit of that policy has brought us quite close to
the achievement of the objective. Am I to abandon the very boat
which has brought me quite close to the shore? Yudhishthira3 would
not forsake his faithful dog and enter the gates of Heaven without
him. For he knew that the Kingdom of Heaven would be as naught to
him without the dog, i.e., his faith. Would the Arab (i.e., the Congress)
give up towards the end of the journey the faithful steed (i.e., non-
violence) that had made it possible for [him]4 to make that journey? It
would be an act of betrayal or faithlessness on my part. Could I, when
the war is at my door and when I am in the same predicament as they,
forget the sovereign remedy I suggested to them5 and clutch at the
1 In his article “The Month in Bardoli—I” from which this discussion is
reproduced, Mahadev Desai gives the following introduction : “Though the actual
decision [of the Working Committee] came to be made on the basis of the
interpretation of the Bombay Resolution, what was of vital importance was the actual
feeling in the minds of men. No matter how the Bombay Resolution was interpreted,
were we clear about certain fundamentals? Were we clear that the policy of non-
violence that we had followed, to the best of our ability, for twenty years was no
religious creed or for no religious purpose, but a wholly political method for the
achievement of the political independence of India? Gandhiji had no doubt on the
question. The next question was—could we at this critical hour in our nation’s history
give up that policy even for the sake of proffered freedom?”

would say, what should be the attitude of individual Congressmen who
had sworn by the method of non-violence?
He was clear that, if it was felt that we had committed a mistake, that it was
worth while bargaining a principle for what seemed to be a richer gain, they should
declare their conviction, and if and when the objective was gained, they should
convert the whole of India into a recruiting ground, ask every man and woman to
contribute his or her share in the war effort, and even extinguish themselves in so
doing. What was needed was downright honesty. He at any rate had never conceived
this possibility. If he knew that some day India would have to engage in a violent war
in order to win independence, he would long ago have addressed every youth to go in
for military discipline, and he would not have placed tireless emphasis, day in and day
out, on the various items of the constructive programme.

661. LETTER TO ABUL KALAM AZAD
BARDOLI,
December 30, 1941
DEAR MAULANA SAHIB,
In the course of discussion in the Working Committee, I discov-
ered that I had committed a grave error in the interpretation of the
Bombay Resolution. I had interpreted it to mean that the Congress was
to refuse participation in the present or all wars on the ground
principally of non-violence. I found to my astonishment that most       
members differed from my interpretation and held that the opposition
need not be on the ground of non-violence. On rereading the
Bombay Resolution I found that the differing members were right and
that I had read into it a meaning which its letter could not bear. The
discovery of the error makes it impossible for me to lead the Congress
in the struggle for resistance to war effort on grounds in which non-
violence was not indispensable. I could not, for instance, identify
myself with opposition to war effort on the ground of ill will against
Great Britain. The resolution contemplated material association with
Britain in the war effort as a price for guaranteed independence of
India. If such was my view, and I believed in the use of violence for
gaining independence and yet refused participation in the effort as the
price of that independence, I would consider myself guilty of
unpatriotic conduct. It is my certain belief that only non-violence can
save India and the world from self-extinction. Such being the case, I
must continue my mission whether I am alone or assisted by an
organization or individuals. You will, therefore, please relieve me of
the responsibility laid upon me by the Bombay Resolution. I must398 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcontinue civil disobedience for free speech against all war with such
Congressmen and others whom I select and who believe in the non-
violence I have contemplated and are willing to conform to prescribed
conditions.
I will not, at this critical period, select for civil disobedience
those whose services are required to steady and help the people in
their respective localities.1
Yours sincerely,

662. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
BARDOLI,
December 30, 1941
If anyone had thought, as I had thought, that the door to
Congress participation in the present war on the ground of Congress
non-violence was closed for ever by the Bombay Resolution, then they
may now know that the Bombay Resolution had not quite closed the
door. Undoubtedly, as the resolution said, the Poona resolution had
lapsed, therefore, the Poona offer had lapsed. But the Congress has
now, through the Working Committee, made it clear that the door is
not barred altogether against Congress participation, certainly not on
the ground of non-violence.
The key for unlocking the door remains principally in the
hands of the British Government. The Working Committtee has very
properly declined to state the terms on which that door can be
opened. It will depend upon varying circumstances, but, in my
opinion, the chief circumstance is the Government. Having been
insulted often enough, the Working Committee would not court any
further insult by making any offer. After all, its position is absolutely
clear. Everbody knows what the Congress stands for and what it wants.
Everyone should, therefore, know that nothing will be accepted by the
Congress short of what it stands for. Therefore, the burden of the next
step is cast on the Government. This is the chief thing that is relevant
at the present time.
I have a pressing cable from those English friends who are
interested in India’s freedom and who are lovers of their own people.
1 For the Congress Working Committee’s resolution in response to this, vide
Appendix “Congres Working Committee’s Resolution”, 30-12-1941.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 399I have not replied to that cable. They have reminded me of Mr.
Andrews’ legacy. Whatever the meaning of their reminder, my mean-
ing could only be one. The one indissoluble bond between Charlie
Andrews and myself was that we would never compromise our cons-
cience on any account whatsoever. And, in all that I have done, I can
fearlessly claim that I have been guided by my conscience.
I have made it clear in my letter1 to the Maulana Sahib that I
could not possibly identify myself with the door to participation being
kept open in any shape or form, because that would mean, in my
opinion, a recantation of all that the Congress has stood for the last
twenty years or more. I would not be guilty of selling that heritage
even for the independence of India because it would not be real
independence.
I feel that if any country has a message for the world, which is
groaning under violence unknown perhaps to history, it is India.
When India, through the Indian National Congress, accepted the
policy of non-violence, so far as I know, no Congressman had thought
that another war—and such a bloody war—was to come so soon as it
has. The testing time, however, has come for India and I, who have an
unchangeable belief in the efficacy of non-violence for the present
distemper from which mankind is suffering, could not possibly in any
manner, directly or indirectly, associate myself with participation in
the war; and so I have stood out.
But the Congress contains men and women holding varying
shades of opinion and, therefore, it should be no wonder that the
Working Committee represents those varying shades of opinion. It has
at least three bodies or, rather, it has at least three bodies representing
three schools of thought: a minority party, believing in non-partici-
pation on the ground of non-violence, pure and simple; the other
believing that the Congress should not carry non-violence to the point
of refusing association in the war under any circumstances and there
is the third, which has many reasons almost as strong as the decisive
reason of non-violence guiding the minority. The resolution2 which
has been just handed by the Secretary of the Working Committee to
the Press is a resultant of the efforts of these bodies. I would like the
public and Congressmen to read that resolution in that light. I hope
everybody will appreciate the fact that the Working Committee has not
come to any hasty decision. It did not mind what time it took in order
1  Vide the preceding item.
2  Vide Appendix “Congres Working Committee’s Resolution”, 30-12-1941.400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIto produce a resolution worthy of the great national organization that
it represents.
I would say one thing to Congressmen that those who are
believers in non-violence in the same sense that I am, have nothing to
fear, as I interpret the resolution of the Working Committee. It not
only leaves them absolutely free to hold that opinion but to propagate
it for the acceptance of anybody who chooses. Only they remain in
the Congress so long as the Congress is not called upon to participate
in the war effort. It is open to them to convert all Congressmen to
their view. I am quite sure that the Working Committee will welcome
such a conversion but I would warn Congressmen against indecision at
this critical period in the national life and I would warn them also
against weakly following this party or that for the sake of gaining
power in the Congress. Those who do so will miserably fail to gain
power for the nation. Personally, I would like the Congress, as I would
like the whole world, to accept non-violence as the law of life in every
department, social, political and domestic. But there is no room for
cowardliness. I would far rather that we all became violent than
cowards. Let me hope, therefore, that every Congressman will have his
own convictions and the courage to enforce them.

in Ashadevi’s home, in order to revise and complete, with her assistance, my English

months of silence, I had caught and removed to the fields not less than 52 scorpions.
One or two snakes also inhabited the place. In Ashadevi’s house, I set about catching
the rats and within about a week removed over thirty to a distant upland.”

like your keeping poor health. Go and join Shakaribehn wherever she

Ghia says regarding the effect of circumcision is not likely to be
correct. There will be no harm in repeating the operation once, if it is
necessary to do so. But there may possibly be some risk in removing

COMMITTEE MEETING  1
BARDOLI,
January 4, 1942
[Gandhiji ] first asked everyone if he had understood all the implications of the
Bardoli Resolution.2
Then let me put it to you in a nutshell. The resolution means
that, if the Government gave a guarantee that full freedom would be
given after the war, the Congress would help in keeping this Empire
alive. It was not that the bargain had been actually made, but the terms
had been agreed upon, whereas, if I did not want to enter into any
bargain at all, I should plainly say so. If you feel that on your
agreeing to offer full co-operation in the war effort, India will have
complete independence after the war, that the British will thereafter
remain in India at your mercy and sufferance, that even during the
war you will run your own affairs provided of course that your
Defence Minister will carry on the war to victory, you must confirm
the Bardoli Resolution. The temptation is very great indeed. If for that
sake you are ready to reverse the Congress policy and purchase swaraj
and pay as price thereof ahimsa, you must confirm the resolution.
Remember that the very greatest of our leaders are party to the
resolution and they have not chosen to do so lightly. As against this
there are those who think that ahimsa is a pearl of great price and that
it cannot be given up, that it can never be the price of swaraj, then
their position is different. But if you are in doubt, if you feel that in
sticking to ahimsa you lose both ahimsa, because you are incapable of
it, and swaraj, that Gandhi is a good man but it would be prudent not
to go the whole length with him, then you must accept the resolution.
Only those will express their disapproval of it who are sure in their
heart of hearts that prudence, political insight, policy, every conside-
ration demands that ahimsa may not be sacrificed for swaraj. Now let
those who will vote for the Bardoli Resolution raise their hands.3
1 Reproduced from Mahadev Desai’s “The Month in Bardoli–I”
2 In reply several people did not raise their hands. For the Resolution, vide
Appendix “Congress Woring Committee Resolution”, 30-12-1941.
3 Thirty-six raised their hands.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 407Good. Now let the acharyas  (masters) of ahimsa raise their hands.1
There were about ten neutrals who wanted to put questions, but Gandhiji said as
the vote was quite informal the neutrals need not trouble themselves.2
Mahatma Gandhi stated that he had not left the Congress, and his position was
the same even at Bombay. He said :
I am a servant of the Congress and I want to serve the Congress
in consonance with the principles of truth and non-violence. The
Working Committee has decided to co-operate with the Government
in war if Britain grants swaraj to India.
Whatever be my opinion, you must exercise our free judgement
in this matter.
It is not a fact that the Congress has violated the principle of
non-violence but it has only made a small opening for violence just
with a view to shaking hands with Britain.
Rajaji thinks that all of us should go to war fully armed, but it
may not be the opinion of all.
We should continue the constructive programme. Of course it
will be now very much restricted. I do not want to send workers to jail
nowadays when their services can be better availed of in alleviating
panic.

682. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS  1
BARDOLI,
January 7, 1942
As far as may be, I have been endeavouring to study the internal
and external reaction to the Working Committee resolution.2 My
being relieved of the direction of Congress civil disobedience does not
reduce my responsibility but increases it manifold. For one thing, my
official disconnection with the Congress itself increases my detach-
ment; but since detachment never means indifference, my attachment
to every Congressman increases and I must speak to him more than
before. The voice of silence was enough to direct the campaign of
civil disobedience, but it is not enough to explain and interpret in
terms of non-violence the day-to-day puzzles that arise in the minds
of Congressmen and others by reason of the overwhelming events
happening near us.
Rangoon was naturally and culturally part of us before Burma
years ago became part of British India and, therefore, it remains part
of us though now sundered. What has happened there,3 has had its
repercussions all over India.
So far as I can see, civil disobedience in the sense in which it was
launched is not likely to be revived on behalf of the Congress till the
war has ended. In a purely symbolic manner it may have to be kept
up not in the name of the Congress but on behalf of resisters of all
war on the pure ground of non-violence, no matter how few they are.
It will be kept up for the sake of asserting the right of resisters to carry
on propaganda against all war. They dare not keep still in the midst of

and write against it, they must, if need be, sacrifice themselves in the
attempt to stop the torrent of blood. Whether they are a few or many
they have to live their mission.
Before taking any step in the direction of civil disobedience I
propose to restart the three weeklies1 and understand the reaction of
Government to the new orientation. I hope that they will have no
objection to propaganda, naturally non-violent, against all war. It
would be non-embarrassing in the sense that there cannot be, as there
never was, any idea of surrounding or picketing munition factories or
recruiting offices.
If the right is not conceded, there must be token civil disobe-
dience by the fewest possible, even one or two known believers in
resistance to all war. I must not select many, because every worker is
wanted to educate the people in the art of non-violent behaviour in the
face of impending danger.
Strange as it may appear, I suggest that ceaseless occupation in
constructive programme is the best preparation to face danger. For it
means concentration in villages of the city people and their being
occupied and occupying the villagers in productive and educative
work.
This removes unemployment and with it fear. Such movement
on a large scale at once inaugurates a new social order. It will cons-
titute the greatest contribution to internal peace, and should render
nugatory formidable panicky ordinances just issued.

687. SPEECH AT KHADI VIDYALAYA  1
BARDOLI,
January 8, 1942
Needless to say that it gives me pleasure to declare this Khadi
Vidyalaya open. There should be many such vidyalayas  in Gujarat.
As a matter of fact Khadi Vidyalaya may be said to have been opened
when in 1921 we decided to prepare for launching satyagraha. I had
not then discovered the word vidyalaya2 and had at any rate not
associated it with khadi, though I knew that khadi was a vidya
(science), and most important of sciences. But I had then not the
courage to say it. But the beginning was made here, anything that was
invented in the line took the name of Bardoli—as for instance, the
‘Bardoli pinjan’ (carding-bow.) Then we had a big depot here for the
manufacture of all our implements. This depot has, for several
reasons, been moved to Sabarmati. Whilst, therefore, it is a pleasure to
me to open the Vidyalaya, it is a matter of sorrow that we should be
opening it at this late day.
It needs no argument today to prove that the charkha is linked
with ahimsa and therefore with swaraj. What is going to be the part
that crores of our people will play during the deadly carnage that is
going on? We know the part that Government are playing, we know
the part that some of us are playing at their behest, and to satisfy the
pangs of hunger and starvation. They are rushing headlong to take
part in the work of destruction. Millions are being collected from the
rich and the poor, and yet the Government coffers are ever empty. But
barring those that are thus directly and indirectly helping in the work
of destruction, what are the rest going to do, what can they do? How
are they to carry on? There is starvation and poverty everywhere.
There is scarcity of water, and unlike in South Africa where there is
1 The translation has been collated with Mahadev Desai’s report “The Month in
 Bardoli-I” published in Harijan, 18-1-1942.
2 Literally, ‘abode of learning’VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 413every provision against droughts, there is none here, and we and our
cattle die like flies for want of water. Those that go to war do so in the
hope of returning alive after killing others, some may not return at all.
But shall we be content to die like flies? We have sworn by ahimsa and
pledged ourselves to win swaraj by ahimsa. It is twenty years since we
took the pledge, yet we do not know how to redeem it. What then is
the thing that will enable us to work for swaraj, and to stand erect and
strong in the face of this conflagration? It is the charkha and all it
means. Land we have, but the land system, uneconomic holdings and
methods, have reduced us to the level of beasts of burden, it does not
yield us enough to eat all the year round, and we are workless for
almost half the year. We have, therefore, to take up subsidiary indus-
tries. Those are the charkha and the allied activities.
I do not want to repeat the argument or go into the implications
of the science of khadi. It is a good thing that this vidyalaya is being
opened. Let this Vidyalaya generate a force that may universalize the
charkha in Gujarat. There are, I am told, seventy thousand Congress
members in Ahmedabad. If all these were regular spinners, did they
give their quota of yarn to the Congress? Congress soldiers should not
forget that their chief weapon is the charkha and spinning regularly is
their ‘military’ discipline. The military weapons and munitions today
have proved futile. They have failed to keep Czechoslovakia, Poland
and France free or alive, though they boasted of renowned soldiers.
Hitler has enslaved them all. Besides, we can no more guarantee the
welfare of a country that engages in armed warfare. President Roose-
velt says he and the Allied Powers are fighting the Axis Powers to
make the nations of the world free, and that the Axis Powers are
fighting to enslave the world. But to me both the parties seem to be
tarred with the same brush.
What shall we do in the midst of this mutual destruction which
spells freedom for none? The charkha and all it means is the only
thing that will enable us to live and make us stand in honour and self-
respect . This we can do if we can combine faith with understanding,
for un-understanding faith will not carry us far. The work has been
placed into Uttamchand’s hands. The responsibility has been entrus-
ted to him, not because he is an expert, but because he has the faith. If
he refuses other responsibilities and concentrates on this task, he is
sure to bring credit to this venture, difficult as it is.
Don’t think that you have come here just to learn the art of
khadi. If you labour under such a misunderstanding you will not be414 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIable to turn out any work anywhere. You have come here to bear the
burden of the work for swaraj. It is a tremendous burden to bear, and
the very first lesson you have to learn is to know the qualifications of
the soldiers of swaraj. The very first is restraint and patient labour.
That is what the charkha will teach you. The renowned cities of the
world are crumbling into dust. London is changed out of recognition,
the edifices which the builders thought would stand the revages of
time are no more. St. Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Buckin-
gham Palace have all been bombed with the result that what is called
the capital of the world today looks, to use Narmadashankar’s word,
“devastated”. And our cities like Rangoon will share the same fate.
The age of cities is thus coming to an end. The slogan of ‘Back to the
villages’ was never so true as today. Therefore all of you at any rate
have to go to the villages. The mills will not be of any avail. They are
producing cloth for the belligerents and may ere long cease even to
do that work, and may have solely to engage in producing munition.
We have therefore to produce all our cloth and to make our villages
self-sufficient in all respects. That you cannot do without a life of
restraint and patient toil. For this you will have to know all the
processes right from identifying the different varieties of cotton to the
stage when it becomes fit to be woven into khadi. The course you
have to prepare for is not simple. It will require all your energies and
your faculties, for it is an all-comprehensive one. What about girls?
Girls also may be admitted, but that depends upon Uttamchand’s
courage. We cannot admit them right now. Every one of us, man or
woman, has to lend his hands and his mind and his heart to the work
of building our nation and swaraj.

688. DISCUSSION WITH HARIJAN WORKERS  1
BARDOLI,
January 8, 19422
The first was the question about the wells: Should we seek the co-operation of
Harijans, and, if so, to what extent?
Co-operation is necessary, but we must not take the Harijans in a
body and invade the savarna quarters. We should visit the wells,
1 This is reproduced from Mahadev Desai’s “The Month in Bardoli–II”. Harijan
 workers who had met in Sabarmati under the Presidentship of Thakkar Bapa came to
Gandhiji with ready-framed questions.
2 From Gandhi—1915–1948 : A Detailed ChronologyVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 415ascertain the classes of people using them, and reason with these to let
the Harijans use them. Regarding Local Board wells the help of offi-
cials may be freely sought, and such Harijans may be asked to go and
use the wells as may be prepared to stand ill-treatment. But the brunt
should be borne by the sevaks1, care being taken to stand between the
Harijans and those who would threaten to molest or belabour them.
The Harijans should be invariably asked to use clean vessels and
observe all the ordinary rules of cleanliness. We can also dig wells for
Harijans and invite the savarnas to use them. It is likely that the
Harijans may be boycotted, we should see that they get employment
elsewhere. The Harijans have to be taught to learn to assert themselves
firmly and non-violently, and the savarnas may be gently reminded
that injustice cannot last for ever. These are broad principles, but
everyone has to take measures suited to the circumstances in each
case.
Q.Can’t we insist on the admission of Harijan boys to hostels where all
non-Harijan Hindu boys are admitted?
A.Of course, but care should be taken to see that the hostel is
not exclusively for a particular community or section of Hindus.
Where all sections are admitted and only the Harijans are excluded,
the workers should strain every nerve to get the Harijans admitted.
When I said that removal of untouchability did not include the
removal of restrictions on inter-dining and intermarriage, I had the
general Hindu public in mind, not the Congress workers or Congress-
men. These have to abolish untouchability from every part of their
life.
The next question was about the temptations given by missionaries in the
shape of books, school fees, etc., with a view to the boys’ ultimate conversion. How
was one to deal with them?
[A.] The missionaries have of course the right to preach the
gospel of Christ and to invite non-Christians to embrace Christianity.
But every attempt to press material benefits or attractions in the aid of
conversion should be freely exposed, and the Harijans should be edu-
cated to resist these temptations.
Q.What are the qualifications that a Harijan sevak should have in order to
make his work felt?
A.Such a question is rather late in the day. But I shall try to
answer it again. It is a misfortune that politics have been mixed up
with anti-untouchability work, which is essentially one of self-
1 Workers416 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIpurification, justice, humanity. Long before I took to politics I felt
that abolition of untouchability and Hindu-Muslim unity were
essential for national well-being. In order to prevent the vivisection of
Hinduism I had to fight it with my life, and the question did receive a
political complexion, but in essence it is a purely religious and moral
question. Every sevak must be fired with a passion to purify
Hinduism, and must be ready to lay down his life in the attempt. Such
a sevak will be ready to sacrifice his all—family connections, social
advantages, and life itself—in order to wipe out the blot on Hinduism.
The work should be as one of life’s essential functions, e.g., offering
one’s prayers, ablutions, etc., not carrying emolument or reward. If
the worker is fired with this passion, the way will be clear before him.
Thus a worker would rather starve than allow the Harijans to be
starved, would hesitate to use amenities which are denied to the
Harijans and feel increasing identification with them every day. All
this work is to be done without regard to the political results. Assum-
ing for a moment that swaraj does not come as a result of the abolition
of untouchability, the work has to be done in order to keep Hinduism
pure and alive. I know that with some of the Congressmen the work
has only a political meaning, but it is wrong. If they seek justice from
an alien Government, they must first do justice to their own kith and
kin. That is the fundamental maxim of equity—he who seeks equity
must do equity.
There is, I know, a section who says that political freedom must
be won first and social reform would follow later. It is a wrong idea,
and certainly inconsistent with one who would win swaraj by non-
violent means. But the Harijan worker has to educate both the ortho-
dox and exclusively political-minded people. Let him not judge
others, but by selfless self-effacing service set an example to them.

689. ADVICE TO KHADI WORKERS  1
BARDOLI,
[On or before January 9, 1942 ]2
[Q.]We are producing two lakhs of rupees worth of khadi, but the demand
exceeds 12 lakhs. How are we to meet it? We have not enough weavers and workers,
and there is the question of funds too.
[A.]Let me take up the last question first. It is my firm
conviction which has grown upon me with the years that, if there are
1 Reproduced from Mahadev Desai’s “The Month in Bardoli–II”
2 Gandhiji left Bardoli on January 9, 1942.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 417workers, no work suffers for want of funds. But the real question is of
the capacity to produce. Supposing someone gave you one crore of
rupees, I know you cannot produce ten crore rupees worth of khadi.
The reason is lack of workers, lack of efficiency, and lack of faith. It
is good that there is a growing demand for khadi—though twelve
lakhs of rupees worth of khadi is nothing extraordinary where eight
crores of rupees worth of khadi could be used. But the increased sales
mean that the liking for khadi is also on the increase. We should
contact these consumers and persuade them to spin. And here comes
in the dhanush takli . You may know that I can spin on the ordinary
wheel better, but I have made a point of using only the dhanush takli ,
and I am now almost an expert in it. The reason is that, whereas
Lakshmidasbhai1 cannot execute an order for 25 lakhs of wheels, the
people can themselves make as many dhanush taklis . It is so easy to
make, so cheap, takes very little material and practically no technical
skill. It is a wrong policy to manufacture wheels in Sabarmati in order
to export them to the Punjab or South India. They should be made
locally everywhere, and for that purpose the dhanush takli is the
thing. Universalization of this will increase production by leaps and
bounds.
You have to catch the increasing love of spinning by the fore-
lock. In none of our previous campaigns was spinning done on such a
large scale as during the last campaign. The figures for Sabarmati Jail
were good, but the figures for Agra and Bareilly were also good.
Badshah Khan has been able to popularize spinning as he had never
been before. We have, therefore, to take this tide at the flood and
bring expert knowledge to bear on the love for spinning that is grow-
ing.
We have to go from house to house and enlist willing spinners
ready to contribute their yarn.
I take it that all khadi workers are believers in the attainment of
swaraj by non-violent means. Yours then should be the largest
contribution to constructive work.
Some of you have to be weavers too. There are enough
handloom weavers in India to produce all the cloth we need. We have

TO THE SUBSCRIBERS
The Manager tells me that the subscribers of Harijan have
appreciated the unavoidable suspension and exercised extraordinary
patience. With a few understandable exceptions they have not recalled
the balance of the unused subscription due to them. I am glad to be
able now to say that they will have their copy again regularly. It will
not be possible to retain the old rate for reasons they know. The
subscriptions left over will be credited to the subscribers who will be
notified when they are to be exhausted. I hope that the three editions
will retain their old popularity. I expect even visible increase, for I
believe in the intrinsic value of the menu that will be served to the
reader from week to week. The three weeklies are purely and simply
media of service. Never have they been a business enterprise.
“VIOLENCE IS DISASTROUS ”
Shri S. V. Thakar, the quiet but efficient worker in the Harijan
and other causes, sends me a note drawing attention to a violent feud
between two parties of Bhils which his intervention with Government
assistance has just prevented. The late Gula Maharaj, himself a Bhil
reformer, had by his earnestness and simplicity appealed to the Bhil
imagination, and thousands of them inspired by him had abandoned
drink and other evil habits. He died a year ago leaving a successor.
There was a social boycott proclaimed by the reform party against
those who would not give up bad habits. This bred bad blood.
Violence seemed imminent. Shri Thakar’s timely intervention
referred to above stopped bloodshed. But the reform has suffered a
setback. The party of opposition is in the ascendant, and unless the
pure ethical spirit again pervades the movement it may collapse. Shri
Thakar rightly wishes to draw the moral that violence even in a good
cause will not answer, and that every reform must be broadbased on
the willing and enlightened association of the people concerned. They
cannot be coerced into good habits.
ADIVASIS
Thakkar Bapa complains that, whilst he likes the pamphlet
dealing with the constructive programme, he misses in it mention of
Adivasis or the so-called aboriginals, such as Santhals, Bhils, etc.1 The
1 A chapter on Adivasis was added in the revised edition of the Constructive
Programme : Its Meaning and Place ; vide “Constructive Programme: Its Meaning and
Place”, 13-12-1941.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 419complaint is just. Many other causes are included in the constructive
programme by implication. But that cannot and should not satisfy
such a humanitarian as Thakkar Bapa. The Adivasis are the original
inhabitants whose material position is perhaps no better than that of
Harijans and who have long been victims of neglect on the part of the
so-called high classes. The Adivasis should have found a special place
in the constructive programme. Non-mention was an oversight. They
provide a vast field of service for Congressmen. The Christian missio-
nary has been more or less in sole occupation of the field. Great as his
labour has been, it has not prospered as it might have, because of his
ultimate aim being
          the Adivasis’  conversion to his fold and their becoming de-
Indianized. Anyway, no one who hopes to construct swaraj on the
foundation of non-violence can afford to neglect even the least of
India’s sons. Adivasis are too numerous to be counted among the
least.

691. PEACE ORGANIZATION
If the Congress were an organization with a military bias, there is
no doubt that today it would be a full-fledged military unit every
member becoming trained to be an efficient soldier. Fortunately for
India and humanity, the Congress is not such an organization. No
other purely national organization is or can be in the India of today.
Fortunately again for India and humanity, the Congress has pledged
itself since 1920 to win India’s freedom through non-violent means.
But up to now it has been largely a debating society, offering civil
disobedience at intervals and all the time only playing with its vital
programme of construction. At one time every Congressman was
expected to create something for the nation. He or she was to spin for
the nation. Congressmen would not respond, and the clause about
spinning was dropped. There were other items too which every
Congressman was to work. But he has not done so to the extent
expected. The moment has now come for him to make a definite
choice. The only programme before him is to become a servant or
soldier of peace. A soldier of peace, unlike the one of the sword, has
to give all his spare time to the promotion of peace alike in war time
as in peace time. His work in peace time is both a measure of
prevention of, as also that of preparation for, war time.
If then I was a Congressman with a vote, I would vote, as an
emergency measure, for requiring every Congressman now on the420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHICongress register or to come hereafter to possess the minimum
qualifications for working the constructive programme. It would be
wrong to remind me that the Congress should retain its democratic
character. It will not lose it because, of its own motion, it becomes an
efficient working body which anybody undertaking to obey its
discipline and conditions of membership may join. The Congress will
cease to be popular, if it cannot deserve popularity in times of stress.
If it cannot provide work for the workless and hungry, if it cannot
protect the people from depredations or teach them how to face them,
if it cannot help them in the face of danger, it will lose its prestige and
popularity. No person or corporation can live long on his or its
capital. The latter has to circulate and multiply itself.
The Congress has become popular because it has been foremost
in fighting imperialism. Today the old way is of no avail. Nobody
thinks of mass revolt at the present moment. The best, quickest and
most efficient way is to build up from the bottom. The psychological
moment has come. ‘Back to the villages!’ has become a necessity
from every point of view. Now is the time to decentralize production
and distribution. Every village has to become a self-sufficient repu-
blic. This does not require brave resolutions. It requires brave,
corporate, intelligent work. As far as I know at the present moment
this is common ground between the rulers and the people.
Let every Congressman answer for himself whether he will be a
soldier or servant of peace or whether he will become a non-entity
unwilling to take his place in building up swaraj.

          692. WHY?
While I was engaged in organizing and conducting the civil
disobedience movement on behalf of the Congress I could not issue
the three weeklies without noticing the doings of civil resisters and the
general progress of the movement. That would have been to turn the
weeklies into civil disobedience organs and to challenge the Govern-
ment to suppress them. The Government in their turn could not but
have accepted the challenge and suppressed the papers and even
prosecuted me. Whilst I must always be ready to welcome imprison-
ment, I was not then ready to court it. Nor was it my plan to invite
suppression when my avowed object was to organize strictly and only
individual civil disobedience. Therefore, even at the price of sacrifi-
cing the pleasure of serving the people in various ways through theVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 421weeklies, duty demanded their stoppage. I feel that the step taken was
correct in every way.
The reason for suspension now no longer exists. On the
contrary I should fail in my duty, if I did not resume publication. As I
have repeatedly said I am no enemy of Britain. I have many dear and
personal friends among Britishers. I cannot wish ill to Britain. My
resistance to war does not carry me to the point of thwarting those
who wish to take part in it. I reason with them. I put before them the
better way and leave them to make the choice.
But we have arrived at a stage where it is no longer merely a
question of resisting war effort. There are questions which confront
war-resisters as much as they confront war-mongers. And they can be
decided only one way by both, though the approach must vary. Such
are questions of dealing with scarcity of food and clothing, looting
and bread riots, etc. I have views on all these and like questions.
Resumption of the weeklies is needed for the dissemination of my
views on these and like matters. In the ability of the people to deal
with them without fuss and even without Government effort lies the
way to swaraj whose basis is non-violence. Mere Government effort
cannot deal with crises affecting millions of people unless there is
voluntary response from them.
If we wish to achieve swaraj through truth and non-violence,
gradual but steady building up from the bottom upwards by construc-
tive effort is the only way. This rules out the deliberate creation of an
anarchical state for the overthrow of the established order in the hope
of throwing up from within a dictator who would rule with a rod of
iron and produce order out of disorder.
These columns will then deal with the day-to-day problems that
face the people.

[On or after January 10, 1942 ]2
I knew the Sardar’s power of organization, but I discovered for
the first time that the Sardar was a skilled agriculturist.  Every inch of
space in the banana garden and every drop of water that was being
given to it had been made careful use of. The banana yielded a yearly

like the mango and the lichi and the chiku and grape fruit, and on the
ridges were various vegetables. Surrounding the garden had been
planted permanent trees, and inside the garden were walks making it
easy for the field-worker to take care of the trees and also providing
enough space with velvety earth for those who desired to have their
morning and evening constitutional. All this was enough to rest and
please the eyes and the mind. The Sardar’s labour had yielded the
Ashram several thousand rupees and set an example to others. As a
result dozens of people had taken to banana-growing.

698. HAND-SPUN AS MEASURE OF VALUE  1
In my part of India shells and seedless dried almonds were used
as coins accepted by the people and the State treasury. They had no
intrinsic value. They were a measure of people’s deep poverty. They
could not afford the lowest metal coin. Five shells would buy them a
little vegetable or a needle. I have suggested a measure which will not
be a mere token but which will have always an intrinsic value which
will also be its market value. In that sense it will be an ideal measure.
For the present and by way of experiment I have suggested a warp
length of a single thread of yarn as the lowest measure and to be used
in dealings principally with the spinners and generally with khadi-
lovers. The spinners can have all their daily wants supplied as against a
fixed quantity of yarn. Stores will need to be maintained by the A. I.
S. A. in combination with the A. I. V. I. A. and ultimately with those
who will give their co-operation. As I conceive it, the system can be
worked only if it is decentralized. This is not its demerit but merit.
The end to be sought is human happiness combined with full mental
and moral development. I use the adjective moral as synonymous with
spiritual. This end can be achieved under decentralization. Centrali-
zation as a system is inconsistent with non-violent structure of society.
I have presented to khadi workers and those who are interested in the
solution of the problem of India’s poverty, the idea of a measure of
value in its barest outline. Let them work it out and find for them-
selves flaws, if any, in the conception, and if they do not, let them
enforce it where they can.

According to your argument any tree can be cut down. Of course, it is

cut down so many trees without consulting the others. The palm is a
poor man’s tree. Do I have to explain to you its usefulness? If all the
palm-trees are cut down, life at Sevagram will be severely affected.
The palm-tree is interwoven with our life. Grass, etc., could have been
sown in some other place. But you should not brood over it. It would
be good if you take whatever lesson you can from it. I cannot spare
any time. Speak to Gajanan1; explain this to others. Assess the utility

The late Sir Akbar Hydari3 was a rare combination. He was a
great scholar, philosopher and reformer. He was a devout Muslim, but
he saw nothing antagonistic to Islam in Hinduism. He was a student of
various religions. He was catholic in the choice of his friends. On the
return voyage from the second Round Table Conference4 we found
ourselves in the same boat. He was a regular attendant at the evening
prayers I used to have on board. He was so interested in the Gita
verses and the bhajans we sang that he had got them all translated for
him by Mahadev Desai. He had made me promise that we should tour
together in India the interest of communal unity. But God had willed
otherwise. The late Lord Willingdon had a different programme for
me. I was plunged into the civil disobedience fight. Sir Akbar and I
could never carry out the programme. He had come under the

1 Illegible428 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI705. SPEECH AT A. I. C. C. MEETING  1
WARDHA,
January 15, 1942
The President has put me in a quandary by raising me skyhigh,
as if, one may think, I were a dweller in the clouds. That is not at all
true. I have not yet used an aeroplane—of course, I have seen them
flying in the skies, like birds but I have not touched one. So the
question of flying does not arise. It is misuse of language to call such
a man a dweller in the skies. I am of the earth, earthy. I am an ordi-
nary mortal composed of common clay.
The question of ahimsa would not have come up before you,
had it not come up before the Working Committee at Bardoli. We
discussed it for seven days. And it was well that it came up. The result
has been good, not bad. But before I say anything on this question, let
me make one or two things clear.
Please note that I am, as I have said, an ordinary mortal like you.
Had this not been the case, we should not have been able to work
together these twenty years. Ahimsa with me is a creed, the breath of
life. But it is never as a creed that I placed it before India or, for that
matter, before anyone except in casual or informal talks. I placed it
before the Congress as a political weapon, to be employed for the
solution of political problems. It is a new experiment in ahimsa which
I have undertaken. As far as I am aware, no one has hitherto em-
ployed ahimsa in the political arena in this manner. If someone has, at
least I am not aware of it. Maybe it is a novel method, but it does not
on that account lose its political character. I tried this for the first time
in South Africa, with good results. I have brought it from there. The
question there was exclusively of the political existence of Indians
who had no political consciousness but had settled in South Africa as
merchants, petty hawkers, etc. And there I used ahimsa as a political
weapon. It was for them a question of life and death. The whites
wanted them to quit. They had only two alternatives. They could
either quit or stay there with the status of animals. We tried everything
that was humanly possible. We found that all the so-called
constitutional remedies, with which the Congress work in India had
made me familiar, had failed. I was an expert in petition-writing which
had yielded me lots of money. I have been for long a draftsman for
1 This translation has been collated with the summary by Mahadev Desai
published in Harijan, 25-1-1942, under the title “Don’t Divide the House”.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 429the Congress here, which work I used to do there also. They submitted
many petitions, but when all other methods failed they resorted to
satyagraha. The various measures that I adopted there were not the
work of a visionary or a dreamer. They were the work of an essen-
tially practical man dealing with practical political questions. As a
political method, it can always be changed, modified, altered, even
given up in preference to another. If, therefore, I say to you that our
policy should not be given up today, I am talking political wisdom. It
is political insight. It has served us in the past, it has enabled us to
traverse many stages towards independence, and it is a politician that I
tell you that it would be a grave mistake to think of giving it up. If I
have carried the Congress with me all these years, it is in my capacity
as a politician. It is hardly fair to describe my method as religious
because it is new.
Maulana Saheb has affectionately used high words of praise for
me, but I cannot accept them. A thing can yet be discarded after
showering all praise on it. A person can be raised sky-high and then
cast down to the dust. I have been taunted as a Bania. It is all right.
How can I help it? I was born a Bania. I shall stay a Bania and shall
die as a Bania. Trade is my profession. I am trading with you and with
the world. The article in my possession is an invaluable pearl. It has to
be weighed in the proper scales—as Maulana Saheb rightly said,
pearls, grass and men need different scales. I am a trader in ahimsa.
Those who can pay the price for it may have it. In my view, it cannot
be bartered away even for independence. But you do not value this
thing as I do; because you do not have the scales with which to weigh
it.
Please do not think that I am speaking to you from a high
pedestal. The simple question is why are we prepared today to discard
a thing which we have cherished for so many years. No doubt, you
have not discarded it yet, but you will if your terms are accepted. This
much I am able to see. I do not raise the question of what we shall do
after swaraj. I am myself not aware what I will do after swaraj. But
today you are eager to barter away ahimsa for swaraj. You had taken a
pledge that you would win swaraj only through ahimsa, and through
no other means. Today you are ready to depart from it. I want to tell
you that this bargain will not bring you complete independence.
Independence for me means the independence of the humblest and
poorest among us. Today we are at the threshold of independence on
the strength of ahimsa. For the Congress to abandon ahimsa and to430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIjoin war1 is to undo the work of the past twenty years. It is my
discomfiture that I could not make you see this.
This is not the time for counting votes.
In spite of holding this view, I stand before you today to plead
with you to accept this resolution2, and not even to divide the house. If
I can convince you of this, you should accept my advice, otherwise
leave it. This is not the time when we may canvass support for our
groups and seek a vote. If we merely talk tall about independence but
do nothing to attain it, how can we aspire for it? I had once said that
everyone would become his own leader after my arrest. Today also
you can become your own leaders and think for yourselves. But I
want you to remember one thing. I am a man who won’t exchange
ahimsa even for independence; and yet I am giving you this advice as
an exponent of ahimsa.
Along with this, I wish to reiterate that I do not wish to with-draw
a single word from what I had written about the Poona Resolution and
I have no regrets for what I said. However, the Bardoli Resolution,
though it looks like the Poona Resolution, is a different thing. The
Poona Resolution attempted to interpret ahimsa. The Bardoli Reso-
lution does not do so. The Poona Resolution was the outcome of my
mistake for which I have already atoned. But the Bardoli Resolution is
the outcome of deliberations over many days. At one time after the
Bardoli Resolution, I had thought of dividing the A. I. C. C. and
testing how many members supported my view. But as the situation
developed stage by stage, as I saw the climate in the country and the
criticism of our Congress in the world, I came to the conclusion on the
basis of my ahimsa that if I could persuade the A. I. C. C. I should
advise them to accept this resolution deliberately and whole-heartedly.
My advice to those who agree with me, that is, to those who have faith
in total ahimsa, is to remain neutral and not vote for or against the
resolution. But if their abstention helps the opponents of this
resolution to defeat it, they should vote in support of this resolution
and not allow it to be defeated.
I have no doubt that the Working Committee has taken a retro-
grade step in passing this resolution. Rajaji may not agree, because he
thinks I am in the wrong. Jawaharlal also may say that there is no
retrograde step in this resolution. But in my opinion this step-back is a
prelude to a step forward. A withdrawal sometimes becomes
necessary. We have a right to take a step back for jumping forward.
1 Mahadev Desai here adds : “before the attainment of complete independence”.
2 Adopted by the Working Committee at Bardoli. For the resolution, vide App-
endix “Congress Working Committee Resolution”, 30-12-1941.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 431Therefore a man who has parted company with you, who claims to be
a satyagrahi and in whose life there is no room for tactical mani-
pulations comes to you and advises you to accept this resolution, how-
ever imperfect, because it correctly reflects the Congress mind. Even if
the protagonists of ahimsa have a majority in this house, they should
help the adoption of this resolution. The Congress does not know its
own mind but I know that the attitude of the Congress is reflected in
this resolution.
The Congress has a great reputation. This resolution has enhan-
ced it. The whole world is watching us, the eyes of our countrymen
are fixed on us. Several people contemplated the prospect with
trepidation, lest the Congress should flounder in response to Gandhi’s
formula and become a religious organization instead of a political
one. Let me dispel their fear, and say that the Congress which
accepted ahimsa as a creed can do no such thing, that we have not
wasted the past twenty years. Whatever a doubting Thomas may think,
when the moment of settlement arrives in Delhi, everyone will realize
that the Congress remains the same with or without Gandhi. The
language may differ, but the demand will remain the same. No one
can cheat it. It will go on repeating ‘ Neti, neti‘1 until it wins the real
substance it wants. If you can get what you want and you strike the
bargain, you may be sure that I will not shed a single tear. If I am
allowed to vent my views through my three weeklies, you will find me
saying that I did become a trader but I could not sell my ahimsa.
Whatever, therefore, our opponents inside and outside India may
think and feel happy about, I won’t let them say that Gandhi was after
all a crazy person. I do not want the Congress to look ridiculous in the
eyes of the world. I do not want it to be said that in order to retain my
leadership you bade good-bye to your senses because you had no
courage to give give me up. I do not covet leadership by undermining
anyone’s manhood. If the Congress alters its resolution for fear of
losing my leadership and if I allow this transaction, this will result in
the degradation of the Congress as well as my own. This is not the way
I work. It is a fraudulent way. Am I going to cheat the Congress after
fifty years of national service?
I have removed the very roots of this risk. I have told Maulana
Saheb that you have not lost me by relieving me. You would lose me
only if I cease to be loyal to the Congress, only if I become a
visionary, only if I cease to be a practical man. It is not at Bardoli that
1 ‘Not this, not this’, formula in the Vedas rejecting all verbal descriptions of
the Reality; here, rejection of every offer falling short of the national goal of
complete independence.432 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII left the Congress; I did so seven years ago in Bombay1 and I did so
in order to be able to render greater service to the country and the
Congress. If I am relinquishing the Congress now, I do so only to
serve it better. Colleagues like the Sardar and Rajendra Babu are not
happy over the resolution but I am asking them not to leave the
Congress. If the real hour for leaving the Congress arrives, and if they
continue to cling to their present convictions, then they may say
good-bye to the Congress. But even if they leave the Congress, the
Congress is not going to cease to function. Its work will go on whether
they are there or not. No man, however great, is indispensable to the
Congress. Those who built up the Congress like Dadabhai, Phero-
zeshah and Lokamanya are no more, but the Congress still functions.
For they have left for us an edifice to work upon and expand. Why
should then my withdrawal or that of other leaders make any
difference? The Congress will survive and will strike the bargain it is
striving for.
I wish to stop you from dividing the house by seeking a vote on
this resolution. I do not want the Congress to look ridiculous in the
eyes of the world. We have not a clean slate to write on. Our leaders
have taken a step which has produced world-wide reactions. To alter
the resolution out of shape is to ignore these. It would be unwise to
change the policy adopted by the Working Committee. It will make
the Congress appear ridiculous before the world. The world has a
right to expect that the Working Committee’s policy will be endorsed
by the A. I. C. C. We have no valid grounds to alter it. To those who
want to catch up with me and introduce a new resolution for preser-
ving ahimsa, I would say: ‘Yes, it does bring you credit. If you have
chewed and digested ahimsa, I shall follow in your footsteps and so
will Maulana Saheb. But I see no such evidence in you. If you bring
another resolution merely to retain my leadership, it will be a foolish
step. In fact, it will amount to violence. Therefore you should accept
this resolution, however imperfect it may be.’
Do not please go away with the idea that there is a rift in the
Congress lute. As Maulana Saheb has said, the Working Committee
has functioned like members of a happy family. Somebody suggested
that Pandit Jawaharlal and I were estranged. This is baseless. Jawa-
harlal has been resisting me ever since he fell into my net. You cannot
divide water by repeatedly striking it with a stick. It is just as difficult
to divide us. I have always said that not Rajaji, nor Sardar
1In October 1934; vide“Letter to Secretary, Gujrat Provincial Congress
Committee”, 30-10-1934  .VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 433Vallabhbhai1, but Jawaharlal will be my successor. He says whatever is
uppermost in his mind, but he always does what I want. When I am
gone he will do what I am doing now. Then he will speak my
language too. After all he was born in this land. Every day he learns
some new thing. He fights with me because I am there. Whom will he
fight when I am gone? And who will suffer his fighting? Ultimately,
he will have to speak my language. Even if this does not happen, I
would at least die with this faith.
There is another reason why this resolution should be
supported. (By chance this resolution has) become a mirror of the
Congress in which all groups can see themselves. I can see my own
reflection, and so can Rajendra Babu, Badshah Khan, Sardar and the
rest. Those who have spent a lifetime in cursing the Government as
also those who wish to compromise with the Government can see their
own reflections in this mirror.
Maulana Saheb has not properly described how this resolution
was framed. This is not the resolution as drafted by Jawaharlal. His
draft has been materially amended. Rajaji also had a hand in revising
it. People have an erroneous impression about Jawaharlal that he never
budges from his views. Today at least he cannot get that certificate. He
argues vehemently, but when the time for action arrives, he can make
considerable compromises. This resolution is a product of a general
consensus. The views of all the members of the Working Committee
are reflected in this resolution. Like khichri it contains pulses, rice, salt,
chilli and spices. Maulana Saheb has already explained the different
points of view within the Working Committee. We have many groups
amongst us. One is represented by Jawaharlal. His opposition to
participation in the war effort is almost as strong as mine, though his
reasons are different. He will not concede that he has retraced his steps
in consenting to this resolution. But he himself will agree that the
Rajaji group can take a different view of this resolution. The original
draft had left no room for Rajaji and his followers to function. Rajaji
would like to participate in the war effort if the Government accepted
the conditions laid down by the Congress. So he has opened a tiny
window for himself. Through this window Rajaji will try to pull
Jawahar towards him and Jawahar will pull in the opposite direction. It
is no longer open to the Government and the Congress critics to say
that the Congress has banged the door against negotiation on the
1 Mahadev Desai’s summary here makes no mention of Sardar Patel.434 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdoctrinaire ground of non-violence. The resolution throws on the
Government the entire burden of wooing the Congress by meeting its
legitimate demands and securing its participation in the war effort.
That nothing much is to be expected from the Government is
probably too true. Only the resolution puts the Congress right with the
expectant world by debunking the criticism that the Congress is an
organization of doctrinaires. And since there is a party in the
Congress ready to welcome an honourable offer that will satisfy the
rigidest test, it is as well that the resolution has accommodated this
party. It has to be seen which group ultimately pulls the others.
Whichever group wins, how can it harm us? We need have no
objection.
Although different points of view have thus been accommo-
dated in this resolution, it is not open to the charge of duplicity. It
seeks to give an opportunity to different points of view to influence
one another. This is how I understand it. Jawahar, Rajaji, Rajendra
Babu as well as a man like me have each some elbow room in this
resolution.
How does this resolution leave scope for Rajendra Babu? We
have contemplated some step for the future, which upsets him. But we
are not here to decide what we shall do in the future. When India
becomes free, the resolution says, we can defend ourselves with arms.
If we wish to help China and Russia, the resolution leaves us free to do
so. We have no ill will against the Britishers, and for that matter against
Germans, Italians or Japanese. How then can we have an ill will against
China and Russia? The Russians1 have created a brave new thing. But I
have my doubts as to how long they can defend their freedom in this
manner. Experience tells us that any great work founded on force
does not last. The Chinese sail in the same boat with us. It is a vast
country and I am proud of it. I would like all these nations to be at
peace with one another. If China seeks to defend herself with arms,
she will have to become like Japan. She will have to do everything that
Hitler and Mussolini are doing. I would like to think that when the
occasion arises India would defend herself through non-violence and
thus be a messenger of peace to the whole world. Jawahar will also
then work for it—not for war. Rajendra Babu can therefore support
this resolution. As a political [weapon] non-violence is no small thing;
it can bring about all these results.
1 Mahadev Desai’s summary has : “who have done great things for the
proletariat”.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 435You should all remember that non-violence is the common
factor among Jawaharlal, Rajaji, Rajendra Babu and Maulana Saheb.
We are all agreed that today we have to work only through non-
violence. We will think of other things at the appropriate time. That is
why I find myself supporting this resolution. Rajendra Babu can
today propagate to his heart’s content the message of ahimsa from the
Congress platform. This resolution leaves him free to do so. Besides
this, the instructions about the constructive programme1 for Congress-
men will promote ahimsa. It includes almost all the items of the
thirteen-point constructive programme put forward by me. The U. P.
Congress Committee has recently passed a resolution which is
praiseworthy. It refers to ahimsa too. It covers everything that I should
like it to.
We have made a clean breast of everything in this resolution.
When all of us are sailing in the same boat, why do you want to
introduce a new resolution? Ahimsa is not a thing which can be
established through mechanical means. Did I serve the Congress for
the last twenty years on the strength of a ‘vote’? On the contrary,
when matters reached the stage demanding a ‘vote’ I voluntarily
retired from the Congress. Voting is all right in small matters, but our
work will be hampered if we decide larger issues by ‘vote’. The
Congress is like a non-violent army. Our effort will be to keep it non-
violent to the end. I am not going to restrain it if on the basis of
experience we realize that we were on the wrong path.
The real strength of the Congress lies in those people who are
outside the Congress but rally to its support when the call goes out.
They do not care for name or fame, nor have they any personal axe to
grind. We have to become their true representatives. You have to forge
the Congress into a strong, solid and disciplined organization.
In the past 15 months Congressmen have evinced some sense of
discipline. Occasionally there were lapses but I tolerated them because
I had to steer the Congress ship. But now we shall have to observe
stricter discipline. The time has now arrived when the Congress should
act with one mind. The ultimate weapon of the Congress today is
ahimsa. Until this creed is altered, no Congressman can preach
violence openly or secretly. If he does so, he will be disloyal. No one
can however judge what lies inside a man’s heart. But we will have to
enlist all those who promise to march in step with us. This resolution
keeps the door open for every honest Congressman.
Finally, some friends ask, ‘What has the Congress done, after
all?’ They complain that the resolution has no operative clause. The
1 Vide Appendix “Congress Working Committee’s Instructions”, 25-1-1942.436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcomplaint is true so far as the resolution is concerned. The Congress
will issue separate instructions for this purpose. The resolution had to
be merely explanatory. It is addressed less to Congressmen than to the
world. It is not even addressed to the Government.
Let there be no misunderstanding nor lack of zeal among
Congressmen because the resolution has postponed satyagraha.
Neither Jawaharlal nor Rajaji will let you remain idle. I certainly will
not. Let those who think the constructive programme is insipid know
that there is nothing in the Working Committee’s resolution to prevent
a Congressman at his own risk from leading civil disobedience—
individual or mass. If he succeeds, he will win nothing but praise from
all and I myself will kiss his feet. The more a person advances in
ahimsa, the more proud will the Congress feel of him. But such
advance should not need any imprimatur  from the Congress. But let
me warn the enthusiasts that they will not handle the weapon with any
success. They will only damage themselves and the cause by any hasty
or ignorant action. And let me say as an expert in the art of
satyagraha that those who regard the constructive programme as
insipid do not know what non-violence is and how it works. So much
for civil disobedience.
           Let us now turn to the parliamentary mentality. Though it
has come to stay in spite of my efforts to eradicate it, the parlia-
mentary programme can, I hold, have no place in Congress work so
long as the war lasts. The Congress cannot handle it without identi-
fying itself with the war effort. I have always held that at all times it is
the least important part of a nation’s activity. Legislators are not the
masters but servants of their electors—the nation. The less, therefore,
we look at and depend upon parliaments the better. Power resides in
the people either through their arms or through their civil
disobedience, more comprehensively described as non-violent non-
co-operation. But the power of non-co-operation comes only through
solid, incessant constructive work. Non-violent strength comes from
the constructive programme only and not through destructive activi-
ties. Hence the constructive programme is the only thing before the
Congress today. And in this all parties are at one.
There are instructions about the constructive programme for
Congressmen. They form the operative part. If properly implemented,
this would be a complete substitute for civil disobedience and the
parliamentary programme. Civil disobedience has been wisely
reserved for me as an expert in satyagraha. It is good, so long as I am
alive and well in mind, that it is so reserved. I have almost put a stop to
it today. But the suspension of satyagraha is not linked with the
resolution. So far as I am concerned, there will be no need forVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARTY, 1942 437satyagraha, if the Government do not interfere with Harijan. For these
three weeklies will constitute enough propaganda against all war.
Harijan will try to carry the message of peace to all corners of the
country. But if this is not permitted, then will be the time for civil
disobedience as a gesture. I want every worker to be out for
constructive activity.
Today we have to serve the millions and that work does not
allow us to get shut up in prisons. We do not wish that thieves and
robbers may ransack the country. Even if we want to unleash a
revolution, we shall have to provide for the prevention of pillage. The
Congress will disappear if it fails to do this. The work of providing
adequate food and clothing to the famished devolves on our
shoulders. But if even the pen is snatched away from my hands, I may
be compelled to become the sole resister. But I have no fixed plans.
Events will point the way.1
The suspension of satyagraha has connection only with the
present condition of the country, and I want every single man who
thinks with me to remain outside and do work rather than go to jail
and read the Koran and the Gita and lead an easy life there. I won’t
let them lead an easy life. Jawaharlal will ask for diaries from
thousands of men. He is not going to sleep. Therefore, if you will go
away with the real message to the country, do not criticize this
resolution. Nobody is rendered incapable of giving the fullest possible
service, in fact he is made capable of the fullest growth, by reason of
this resolution. Civil disobedience remains under my control, and the
reason for its suspension is wholly extraneous to my retirement from
office. Every one of you has to give a good account of yourself. If all
will pull your full weight in the fulfilment of the constructive
programme, you will find a different India in six months’ time.

WARDHAGANJ ,
January 17, 1942
Gandhiji explained what had been achieved at Sevagram in regard to the
restoration of communal unity and removal of untouchability and urged that they were
assets which should be acquired whether freedom was obtained or not. He also pointed
out what work had been done with regard to khadi and basic education.
He dealt with the various aspects of the constructive programme, with
particular reference to Hindu-Muslim unity, the removal of untouchability, charkha
and the organization of a volunteer corps.
Mahatma Gandhi emphasized that a mere pact between the Congress and the
Muslim League would not solve the problem; such a pact was applicable only to the
carrying out of the parliamentary programme. He referred to the Lucknow Congress-
League Pact2 and said that real Hindu-Muslim unity could only be brought about by
active constructive work.
Answering a question, Gandhiji said that volunteer bodies must be organized
but only on the basis of non-violence. The volunteers must render all help to the
people. It was possible that these organizations might not be allowed to function. In
such circumstances, they must carry on their work, if it was indispensable, even at the
risk of their lives.3
Everyone who is a four-anna member of the Congress must
become a Khudai Khidmatgar now by service to the people.
Concluding, Gandhiji exhorted them to carry out the instructions given by the
Working Committee carefully, which alone would strengthen them in the struggle for
freedom.

[Before January 18, 1942 ]
The would-be satyagrahi2 said he was a believer in ahimsa. Gandhiji asked     
him :
How much do you spin—5 yards or 50 yards?
Never more than 50, and sometimes even less than 5.
Do you spin every day, or once every week, or every month?
I don’t spin more than 50 or 100 yards in a month.
Do you make your own slivers?
No, Mahatmaji.
Then where do you get them from? Get them by post?
No, I get them from the khadi bhandar, and when I do not get them there, I get
them through friends coming from places where slivers can be had.
Do you make you mal (string) yourself or do you purchase a
reel from the market?
His friend intervened and said : “Mahatmaji, he is a believer in ahimsa, and
that, I thought, was the essential qualification. According to the test you now apply
we are all likely to fail.”
Well, then it is better that none of you takes part in satyagraha
than that you should go without being properly qualified. My
standard is inexorable. I want you to spin not only regularly but
intelligently. I want you to know how to test your yarn, how to draw
fine yarn and coarse yarn, to know the economics of khadi and so on.
And when you will say to me, ‘I know all these things’, I will ask     
you : ‘What about you life?’ Do you observe non-violence in your
relations with the members of your family and in your daily affairs?
Where is the good of your saying you accept non-violence in theory?
Supposing you said you accepted the theory of khadi, but purchased
and used foreign cloth, how would your acceptance of the theory help
me? And please understand that, while in British India I am prepared
to reconcile myself to belief in ahimsa as a policy, I want you in the
States to believe in it as a creed. Violence in many Indian States is
greater than in British India, and we want the supreme purity and
sacrifice of a Prahlada to meet the violence there. Give me a Prahlada,
and I shall give him my blessings.

SEVAGRAM ,
January 18, 1942
DEAR KHAN SAHEB,
Maulana Saheb and Jawaharlal had a long talk with me over
your retiring from the Congress. They say that they never understood
that you had contemplated withdrawal from the Congress. They said
that the talk was plainly about withdrawal from the Working
Committee only. They said too that in their opinion your withdrawal
even from the W.C. was sure to be misunderstood and would harm the
very cause you have at heart. Naturally you are the best judge of the
situation. You would give due weight to their opinion. I can have no
opinion. I rely entirely upon your judgement on the facts. If the facts
are as they say, their opinion should prevail. If they are otherwise and
you have no such fear as they entertain, your opinion should prevail.
They further said that you should take no step without the
approval of Dr. Khan Saheb and your co-workers. They say too that
if you go, Dr. K. S. must come to the W.C. You will now tell me and
Maulana Saheb what is to be your judgement.1
I hope my letter is clear. With love,

1 The addressee resigned from the Congress Working Committee on February
8, 1942.442 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI713. REAL WAR EFFORT
The greatest need of the immediate present is to feed the hungry
and clothe the naked. There is already scarcity in the land both of
food and clothing. As the war progresses, both the scarcities must
increase. There are no imports from outside, either of food-stuff or of
cloth. The well-to-do may not feel the pinch as yet or at all, but the
poor are feeling it now. The well-to-do live on the poor. There is no
other way. What is then their duty? He who saves gains as much, that is
to say, he produces as much. Hence those who feel for the poor, those
who would be one with them must curtail their wants. There are many
ways. I shall only mention some here. There is much, too much food
eaten and wasted by the well-to-do.
Use one grain at a time. Chapati, rice, and pulses, milk, gur,
ghee, and oil are used in ordinary households besides vegetables and
fruit. I regard this as an unhealthy combination. Those who get
animal protein in the shape of milk, cheese, eggs or meat need not use
pulses at all. The poor people get only vegetable protein. If the well-
to-do give up pulses and oils, they set free these two essentials for the
poor who get neither animal protein nor animal fat. Then the grain
eaten should not be sloppy. Half the quantity suffices when it is eaten
dry and not dipped in any gravy. It is well to eat it with raw salads
such as onion, carrot, radish, salad leaves, tomatoes. An ounce or two
of salads serves the purpose of eight ounces of cooked vegetables.
Chapatis or bread should not be eaten with milk. To begin with, one
meal may be raw vegetables and chapati or bread, and the other
cooked vegetables with milk or curds.
Sweet dishes should be eliminated altogether. Instead, gur or
sugar in small quantities may be taken with milk or bread or by itself.
Fresh fruit is good to eat, but only a little is necessary to give
tone to the system. It is an expensive article, and an over-indulgence
by the well-to-do has deprived the poor and the ailing of an article
which they need much more than the well-to-do.
Any medical man who has studied the science of dietetics will
certify that what I have suggested can do no harm to the body, on the
contrary it must conduce to better health.
This is only one way of saving food-stuff. It is obvious. But by
itself it cannot produce much visible effect.
Grain-dealers have to shed their greed and the habit of making
as much profit as possible. They must be satisfied with as little as
possible. They run the risk of being looted, if they do not gain the
credit of being keepers of grain for the sake of the poor. They shouldVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 443be in touch with the people in their neighbourhood. Congressmen
have to visit grain-dealers within their beat and give them the message
of the time.
By far the most important part of the work consists in educating
the villagers to keep what they have and to induce cultivation of fresh
crops wherever water is available. This requires widespread and
intelligent propaganda. It is not generally known that bananas,
potatoes, beetroot, yam and suran, and in a measure pumpkin are a
food crop easily grown. They can take the place of bread in time of
need.
There is, too, scarcity of money. There may be grain available
but no money to buy it with. There is no money because there is no
employment. This has to be found. Spinning is the readiest and the
handiest. But local needs may supply other sources of labour. Every
available source has to be tapped so that there is no want of
employment. Only the lazy ones need and must starve. Patient
handling will induce even this class to shed their laziness.
The problem of clothing is much easier than feeding, if it is
handled well and in time. The mills may not be relied on in these
times. There is ample cotton to be had in India. It is a problem for
cotton cultivators how to dispose of their stock. The outside market is
closed to them. Our mills cannot absorb the whole of the crop. It can
be utilized, if the nation takes to spinning not for wages but for the
sake of clothing the naked. Of course those who need employment
will spin for profit. This number must be limited. They need
organizing. Much money will be needed for the purpose. But national
spinning does not need so much organizing. Profit motive being
eliminated and willingness being assumed, organization is reduced to
simplest terms.
This is no time for multiplying wheels. They take time to
manufacture. Raw materials are daily becoming dearer. Wheels cannot
be manufactured everywhere. Places where they are can be counted
on the fingers of one hand.
Therefore I suggest the plying of the dhanush takli  and even the
simple takli. The former should be manufactured locally. Indeed it is
difficult to manufacture the simple takli at once in lacs. The dhanush
takli is the only thing which can be easiest manufactured. Slivers
cannot be supplied to spinners. Each one should get some cotton for
himself or herself, and card it as well as may be with the hand or with
a home-made small bow such as the children in the Bihar basic
schools have. All this can be done because no one is expected to
manufacture a large quantity of yarn. If every one of our available444 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImillions span for one hour daily, there would be enough yarn to keep
every handloom going. The reader should know that there are lacs of
handloom weavers in the land. There is danger of their starving for
want of yarn.
Here is a great task for every Congressman to undertake. He has
to become a good spinner and carder and know how to manufacture
the dhanush takli . Let every Congressman begin with himself and his
family and neighbours, and he will find that the life-giving contagion
spreads like wild fire which envelops you before you hardly know
what you are witnessing.
Any organization that tackles these two problems successfully
will command the love and confidence of the people. I hope that all
will join in this real war effort. It is none the less effective because it is
peaceful and constructive.
Will the Princes let their people do this work without let or
hindrance? Will Quaid-e-Azam Jinnah allow the members of the
Muslim League to co-operate with the Congress workers in this truly
national but non-political work which is also humanitarian? There are
23,000 Muslim spinners, carders and weavers earning their daily bread
through the A.I.S.A.
ON THE WAY TO KASHI, January 19, 1942
Harijan, 25-1-1942
714. CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME AND GOVERNMENT
Will not the working of the constructive programme bring
Congressmen into conflict with the Government? This was one of the
many questions asked at the meeting of the principal members of the
A. I. C. C. I addressed in Wardha on the 17th. My answer was that the
whole programme was so conceived as to avoid conflict. Of course the
most innocent activity may be so manipulated as to provoke conflict. I
expect every Congress worker to do his best to avoid it. But there is no
help for it, if the Government prohibit such activities because they are
undertaken by Congressmen who believe that the working of the
constructive programme will bring swaraj. That is the only non-violent
way to achieve the end. Swaraj by non-violent means must come from
the creative effort of those who desire it. The Government should
welcome every such effort, unless they want to prevent even cent per
cent non-violent movement. In that case conflict will become
unavoidable. But I am of opinion that no conflict is possible, at any
rate while the war lasts, unless the Congress workers want or provoke
it. They have to work, work and work. They will make no speeches orVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 445demonstrations in doing their constructive work. As I have already
said, today most of the items of constructive work happen to be—like
feeding and clothing—common cause between the Government and
the people.

715. COMMUNAL UNITY
Freedom will not come through parliamentary effort. Therefore
communal pacts, whilst they are good if they can be had, are valueless
unless they are backed by the union of hearts. Without it there can be
no peace in the land. Even Pakistan can bring no peace, if there is no
union of hearts. This union can come only by mutual service and co-
operative work.
Separate electorates have resulted in the separation of hearts.
They presupposed mutual distrust and conflict of interests. They have
tended to perpetuate differences and deepen the distrust.
How to get out of the tangle is the question. I want just now to
confine myself to the four Muslim majority provinces. In them there
is natural Pakistan in the sense that the permanent majority can rule
the minority. I hold it to be utterly wrong thus to divide man from
man by reason of religion which is liable to change. What conflict of
interest can there be between Hindus and Muslims in the matter of
revenue, sanitation, police, justice, or the use of public conveniences?
The difference can only be in religious usage and observances with
which a secular State has no concern.
Congressmen, if they are not to merge in the Hindus as Hindus,
must rigidly abstain from the legislatures and local bodies governed
by separate electorates. In these provinces the separate electorates
must be taken to have come from the Hindu demand and in the
supposed Hindu interest. But a Congress Hindu has no interest apart
from his Muslim brother. Therefore he must not enter the electoral
bodies where Hindu and Muslim interests are falsely regarded as
separate and even antagonistic. If he enters these bodies, he can do so
only to divide the majority members, i.e., to take sides with one
Muslim party or another. If I could make all Hindus Congress-
minded, I would withdraw every Hindu member from these bodies
and put the Muslim members on their honour. I would seek to
influence them from outside these bodies by being friends with them
and rendering disinterested service. I would be indifferent to their
manning all the services. At the most an infinitesimal percentage can446 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhave a share in them. And it is a superstition to suppose that these
services can oppress a people who have become
conscious of human dignity and human rights and know how to
enforce them. Since the vast majority of Congressmen are Hindus in
at least three Muslim majority provinces, they have a rare opportunity
of showing their non-violent strength, their disinterestedness, their
utter freedom from the communal taint, and their ability to submit to
the rule of their Muslim fellow-countrymen. They will do this not in a
huff but as true nationalists and friends of the Muslims. Remaining
outside they will probably better protect the just interests of Hindus as
citizens. For a Congress Hindu is not any the less a Hindu because he
claims to represent equally, as he must, all the other faiths in himself.
For as I have said, so far as the State is concerned, its capacity for
service stops short of the service of the different faiths, and the
services it can render apply to all irrespective of their faiths. Therefore
Congressmen have a rare opportunity of showing undefiled
nationalism in these provinces. They will incidentally show the other
minorities that they have nothing to fear from the majorities if they
know the true way. We must get out of the miasma of religious
majorities and minorities. Why is a Parsi’s interest different from a
Hindu’s or Muslim’s so far as the State is concerned? Did not
Dadabhai and Pherozeshah rule the Congress while they lived, not by
Congress grace or patronage, but by right of service and merit? Did
their rule injure any Hindu or Muslim interest? Were these interests
ever in conflict on the Congress platform? And is not the Congress a
voluntary State?

716. QUESTION BOX
CONGRESS AND A. R. P.
Q.Can a Congressman belong to A.R.P. and such other committees
connected with the war?
A.I think not. But this does not mean that he will render no
help in caring for those who may be injured by bombs or otherwise.
On the contrary he will be expected to be most assiduous in rendering
such help.
ECONOMIC EQUALITY
Q.While working the constructive programme, can a Congressman preach
economic equality? How can working the civil disobedience programme bring it
about?VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 447A.You can certainly preach it, if your speech is strictly non-
violent and not in the manner of some who, I know, have preached
forcible dispossession of landowners and capitalists. But I have shown
a better way than preaching. The constructive programme takes the
country a long way towards the goal. This is the most auspicious time
for it. The charkha and the allied industries, if fully successful,
practically abolish all inequalities, both social and economic. The
rising consciousness of the strength which non-violence gives to the
people, and their intelligent refusal to co-operate in their slavery must
bring about equality.
STRENGTHEN THE ORGANIZATION
Q.What is the meaning of strengthening the Congress organization?
A.You can strengthen it no doubt by enlisting members who
know the meaning of the fundamental article of the Congress, namely,
attainment of Purna Swaraj by peaceful and legitimate means.
Enlisting of bogus members and members for seizing power in the
Congress is vicious and harmful.
There is no room for power politics within the Congress, if the
Congress is to end the power or the system that grinds the people and
be itself in power. Therefore real strengthening of the organization
consists in every Congressman working the constructive programme
to its fullest capacity. Enlisting bona fide members without much
effort provides running expense of the Congress, only if the enlisting
itself does not eat up the subscriptions you collect from members.
‘OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ’
Q.What do you mean by associating with other volunteer organizations
working for similar ends? Do you include communal organizations?
A.I do. Unfortunately we have very few other non-communal
organizations. ‘Similar ends’ naturally means constructive ends, using
‘constructive’ in the widest sense of the term. Thus you will tender
your help to a Muslim League or Hindu Sabha volunteer in putting
out fire or tending the wounded. You will also invite their help in such
matters.

717. SPEECH AT BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITY1
January 21, 1942
REVERED MALAVIYAJI, SIR RADHAKRISHNAN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
You all know very well that I have neither the physical strength
nor the inclination to undertake a long journey, and yet when I
received Sir Radhakrishnan’s invitation to deliver an address on the
occasion of the Silver Jubilee Convocation of the Benares Hindu
University I had not the heart to decline it. You know the strong bond
of affection that binds me to Malaviyaji, and it is with a certain
amount of pride and satisfaction that I obey his behest whenever it is
at all possible for me. I therefore could not say ‘no’, Sir
Radhakrishnan’s letter was a call to a pilgrimage.
Great as are Malaviyaji’s services to the country, I have no
doubt that this University constitutes his greatest service and
achievement, and he has worn himself out for the work that is dear to
him as life itself. It was out of my great regard for him that twenty-
five years ago I accepted his invitation to attend the foundation
ceremony of this University.2 I knew that in that august function,
which was to be attended by the Viceroy and the ruling Princes of
India, there was no place for a poor man like me. I had not then been
made a Mahatma, and if anyone called me by that name, I knew I
must have been mistaken for Mahatma Munshiramji, as the late Swami
Shraddhanand was then called. For there cannot be a number of
Mahatmas, and I knew even when I was in South Africa that
Munshiramji’s great work had entitled him to that name. He also was
one of those who sent me messages of congratulations and
compassion. In those days too Malaviyaji Maharaj showered his
kindness on me. But he has a knack for detecting servants of the
people, however obscure they may be, and bringing them into his
fold. This is his usual trick.
People have great admiration for Malaviyaji Maharaj as you
must have heard today. He deserves every word of it. I know the
Hindu University is a huge affair. There is no greater beggar than
Malaviyaji on the face of the earth. He has never begged for himself;
by the grace of God he has never been in want, but he became a
voluntary beggar for causes he has made his own, and God has always
filled his bowl in an overflowing measure. But he has an insatiable
1 This has been collated with Mahadev Desai’s translation in Harijan,
1-2-1942, under the title “Kashi Vishwavidyalaya Address”.
2 Vide Speech at Benares Hindu University”, 6-2-1916.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 449appetite, and although he got a crore and ten lacs instead of the crore
he wanted he is still asking for more. Even at this moment he
whispered into my ears that he had a good donation from the
Maharaja of Darbhanga, our Chairman. I know how Malaviyaji leads
his own life. It has been my privilege to be acquainted with every
aspect of his life. It is a rare good fortune to have him still in our
midst, a living example of a pure life of plain living and high
thinking; the students particularly can draw many a lesson from his
life but I have a fear that, though he is physically in your midst, many
of you are untouched by his great example. The fault is wholly ours,
not his. The sun radiates heat and light to all on earth, but how can
even the sun help those who will shut themselves from him? But I am
not here to sing Malaviyaji’s praises. Who can be more unfortunate
than the one who in spite of being so near to him fails to imbibe his
noble qualities such as his simplicity, sacrifice, patriotism, generosity
and universal love?
I must now address a few words to you—the teachers and the
students of the Vidyapith. When I accepted Sir Radhakrishnan’s
invitation he had asked me to send a copy of my address to him. I
told him that I had no time to write anything, I did not even know
what I should be able to say. A feeling of nervousness overpowers me
when I am in the midst of learned men. Ever since my return to India
my lot has been cast among the poor and the downtrodden—those
whom the Congress represents—and whilst in their midst I feel no
sense of constraint or hesitation. In your midst I feel tongue-tied. I
simply said to Sir Radhakrishnan that I should trust to the inspiration
of the moment. That inspiration has come, but I do not know how you
will welcome my plain-speaking.
As speaker after speaker spoke and left the dais, I longed for
someone who would address the audience in Hindi or Urdu, or
Hindustani, aye, even in Sanskrit,—even in Marathi, or for that matter
in any of the Indian languages. But no such good luck befell me and
you. Why? We are slaves and have hugged the language of those who
have kept us enslaved. It has become a fashion to blame the
Englishmen for all our ills. I have not hesitated to blame them for
many things they have done. I have never charged them with
compelling us to adopt English as the medium of expression. We
devote precious years of our lives to learning the English language,
our ambition being to be able to speak English as Englishmen, and
our breast swells with pride when an Englishman pats us on our back
for speaking flawless English. Think of the time and energy of our
youth expended on learning the English language, as if it was our
mother tongue, and calculate by simple multiplication the number of450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIyears and the volume of precious energy that are lost to the nation.
And yet all this is happening in the Benares Hindu University
which has been extolled today as the living embodiment of Indian
culture. Malaviyaji did all that was necessary to draw the best possible
teachers by attractive salaries, but he could not do the rest. It was not
his fault that Hindi did not take the place of English. The teachers are
the product of the tradition which they have inherited, and the
students are content to accept what they get from them. They need not
be. They go on strikes and even hunger-strikes, often for trivial
reasons. Why will they not insist on having their tuition in the all-India
language? There are, we were told today, 250 students here from the
Andhra Province. Let them go to Sir Radhakrishnan and ask for an
Andhra section of the University and ask to be taught through the
medium of Telugu if they will not learn the all-India language. But if
they were to be guided by my lights, being Indians they should
demand as the medium of instruction a language understood
throughout India. And Hindustani alone can be that language.
You know what has happened in Japan—a country which I do
not regard as essentially great—but which is regarded as great in Asia
in that it has successfully challenged the supremacy of America and
England. The thouands of boys and girls in the Japanese schools and
colleges receive their education not through the medium of English
but through Japanese. Their script is difficult, but it is no bar to their
learning it and they have not given it up in preference to the Roman.
Not that they boycott English and other European language. But they
economize their energy. Those who need to learn them do so for
enriching the Japanese thought with knowledge which the West alone
can give. They take care to turn into Japanese all that is worth taking
from the West. That is because the mind of Japan’s youth is fresh and
alert. The knowledge gained thus has become national property.
There would have been no greater folly if instead of doing so they
had thrown their mother tongue to the winds and opened English
medium schools and colleges such as we find in other countries. In
this way they might well have learnt a new language but the Japanese
people could not have gained the new knowledge. Our ambition does
not go beyond becoming clerks in Government offices, lawyers,
barristers, judges, all helplessly serving the system they would fain
destroy. And we have not succeeded in mastering the English
language either. After all, is it not an alien language? I get numerous
letters from English-educated people—some of them possessing the
highest degrees of our universities—but they betray a woeful
ignorance of the English language. The reason is simple. Malaviyajis
and Radhakrishnans are rare, and the thousands cannot achieve whatVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 451they have done.
As I was listening to the English speeches I was amazed at the
patience and innate courtesy of our people who, though they do not
understand a word of what is said, do not mob us, as they well might
do. If there is any doubt in your minds about this, I can demonstrate
to you by a show of hands how few—even from among the students—
have followed the proceedings here. I had said all this when I came
here twenty-five years ago. What I have seen today compels me to
repeat it all.
There is another thing to which I am tempted to draw your
attention. I witnessed this morning a scene that I had least expected
here. There was a Vasant Panchami day1 procession of the students
who had to march past Malaviyaji’s house after receiving his silent
blessings. The way in which they were walking betrayed a lack of even
elementary physical training. Instead of walking in step, erect and
disciplined like soldiers on the march, they walked haphazardly in a
desultory fashion. Their walking could hardly be called a march. In
my opinion they are so much burdened with English that they find no
time to attend to other things. That is why they are unable to learn the
things they must.
I noticed another thing while returning after a visit to Shri
Shivprasad Gupta in the morning. I cannot help saying a word about
the sight that greets you as you enter the great portals of the
University. Thanks to the money that Malaviyaji can get for the
asking, the gate is in consonance with the splendour of the edifices
here. But what did I find on the top of the gate?—the bulk of the
space (three-fourths) taken up by the words BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITY
in English, and one-fourth given to the inscription in Hindi which is
the language through which you would derive your knowledge. I
wondered what need there was of the English language? Malaviyaji
cannot be blamed for this. It must have been the work of some
engineer. Just a little thought on the part of those who were in charge
of such things would have been enough to tell them that what was
needed there was the name written in Devanagari and Persian scripts—
which would have symbolized to the people the desire on the part of
Malaviyaji’s University and Sir Radhakrishnan for communal
harmony. It would have been in the fitness of things too, as both
Hindi and Urdu are understood in this region and both the scripts are
familiar. The fact that it is written in English is an indication of the
domination of the English language over our minds.
We are scared of learning a new language or a script, whereas
1 On which the Goddess of Learning is worshipped452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfor us learning an Indian language or a script should be as easy as
anything. Surely it is no difficult thing for a non-Hindi-speaking
person to learn Hindi or Hindustani. I can undertake to teach Hindi to
anyone knowing Gujarati, Bengali or Marathi in the space of three
months. Even the South Indian languages—Tamil, Telugu,
Malayalam, Kannada—are full of Sanskrit words and, if there was just
a little fervour and love of the country in us, we should not hesitate to
decide to write all the languages derived from Sanskrit as also the
Southern group in the Devanagari script. These languages have not
only a fairly common vocabulary, there is also a striking resemblance
in the scripts. If our minds were not fagged, we would easily know
half a dozen Indian languages. Then there is Urdu which should not
be difficult to learn, if only our Urdu scholars did not make it a matter
of pride to pack it with Persian and Arabic words, as the pundits pack
Hindi with Sanskrit words. The result is that I am completely at a loss
when high-flown Urdu of the Lucknow style is flung at me.
One more thought I should like to leave with you. Every
university is supposed to have its tradition, its distinctive feature—
Oxford and Cambridge, for instance, have theirs. They take pride in
the fact that the students they turn out can at once be identified for the
distinctive impression left on them by the universities. Our universities
leave no such distinctive mark. But I am afraid our universities are the
blotting-sheets of the West. We have borrowed the superficial features
of the Western universities, and flattered ourselves that we have
founded living universities here. Do they reflect or respond to the
needs of the masses? Now I am told that a special feature of your
University is that engineering and technology are taught here as
nowhere else. I should not consider this a distinguishing feature. Let
me make a suggestion to you. Have you been able to attract to your
University youths from Aligarh? Have you been able to identify
yourselves with them? That, I think, should be your special work, the
special contribution of your University. Money has come in, and
more will come in if God keeps Malaviyaji in our midst for a few
more years. But no amount of money will achieve the miracle I
want—I mean a heart-unity between Hindus and Muslims. I would
like you to go out to invite Mussalmans to come here, and not to mind
if they reject your advances. You are the representatives of a great
civilization which according to Lokamanya Tilak is 10,000 years old
and according to later scholars even older. This civilization regards
ahimsa as the supreme dharma. This has been our tradition from the
times of the Vedas. The special contribution of that civilization is to
befriend the world, to turn so-called foes into friends. Our civilization
has absorbed, like the holy Ganga, many streams from outside, and itVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 453is my prayer that the Hindu University which is endeavouring to
represent Hindu culture and Hindu civilization may invite and absorb
all that is best in other cultures and nurse hostility towards none. That
should be its distinctive feature. English will not help you to evolve
this. It is our own ancient learning that will teach you this—our
scriptures learnt and understood in the proper spirit.
One thing more and I have done. You are living in palatial
hostels, but you should not get used to living in palaces. Look at the
little house in which Panditji lives in utter simplicity and without the
least splendour. You enter his room. There is no decoration and only
the barest furniture. You, who will be his heirs, should model your
lives accordingly. Many of you are children of poor parents. Don’t
forget that you have to represent the poor, and that therefore a life of
ease and luxury is inconsistent with the poverty of our land. May you
be all models of plain and simple living and high thinking like
Malaviyaji. May God bless you with long life and the wisdom to carry
out what I have said, if it has appealed to you.

718. DISCUSSION WITH CONGRESS WORKERS1
BENARES,
January 22, 1942
Q.What is your ultimate object? Do you want the Congress to accept your
principles or to achieve its object?
A.Every plan and programme that I have placed before the
Congress has been placed with a view to achieving the goal of
independence. Truth and non-violence are a matter of creed for me—
you may call it my religion, but it has not been my object to
propagate that religion through the Congress. Before the Congress
they have been placed as effective means to an end—as political
means for a political objective, as I did in South Africa. If it was
otherwise, I should cease to be a political worker and occupy the
position of a dharmaguru2. The political method can be changed
whenever expedient, but the change should be honest and deliberate.
But one should not pretend to adhere to the method when really in
practice one has given it up. That would be deceiving oneself and the

the proceedings of two meetings—one of the Executive of the U.P. Provincial
Congress Committee and the other of the U.P.P.C.C.
2 Religious head454 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIworld.
Q.We should like to have a glimpse of the next six months of a year as you
picture it to yourself. You have often said that this is a fight to the finish, your last
fight which will not end until the goal is won. What are likely to be the future
developments as you can visualize them?
A.It is a good question, and also a difficult question. Not that I
am not clear, but because it takes us into the realm of speculation. I let
things and happenings react on me—though I confess I do not follow
everything as Jawaharlal with his study of foreign affairs can.
Jawaharlal is convinced that the British Empire is finished. We all wish
that it may be finished, but I do not think it is finished. We know that
the Britishers are tough fighters, we know what the Empire—especially
India—means to every home in Britain, and therefore they will never
consent to be ‘Little Englanders’. Mr. Churchill has said that they are
not “sugar candies”, and that they can meet rough with rough.
Therefore it will be long before the Empire is finished. There is no
doubt, however, that they are nearing the end, and what Jawaharlal has
said is very true that, if we could do nothing to prevent the war, we
certainly will do much to prevent a peace in which we have no voice.
That is what every Congressman has to bear in mind. We have,
therefore, to be up and doing. If we sit with folded hands, we may
have a peace which we do not desire.
I adhere to the statement that it is my final fight, but we have
had to alter our programme because of the latest developments,
because war has come to our door. The suspension had nothing to do
with my retirement from the official leadership of the Congress. Even
if it had continued, how could I today ask Jawaharlal to march back to
jail? Of course he will be in jail, if he is prevented from doing the
work we have chalked out. But things have happened so rapidly that
we had not the slightest idea of what was coming. How then can I talk
of a year or even six months ahead? That we are marching swiftly
towards independence I have no doubt. There is no doubt about the
programme ahead of us. No Congressman should rest content with
just paying his four-anna fee. He has to be active all the twenty-four
hours. Even the one concrete programme of production of cloth is
sufficient to occupy all our energies. There are 4,000 students in the
Benares Hindu University. Will they spin an hour every day? I am
talking of spinning because it is a thing nearest my heart, but there are
a hundred and one other things. Have the villagers enough food to
eat? Have they enough to cover themselves in this bitter cold? These
are the questions that occur to me again and again. On our capacity to
feed the starving and clothe the naked and generally to serve the
masses in the time of their need will depend our capacity to influenceVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 455the peace whenever it comes. What I have said applies to all parties.
Whoever serves the purpose best will survive and have an effective
voice.
Q.You think they cannot have a treaty just as they like?
A.I do. The days of secret treaties are gone, I hope. If we
behave ourselves, we can have a decisive voice at least so far as we are
concerned. But Jawaharlal can explain these things better. I am no
student of history or even of contemporary events in the world.
Q.Why did you advise the A.I.C.C. members to support the Bardoli
Resolution, though at one stage you had decided to divide the house? Rajaji’s
speeches after the A.I.C.C. are against the Bombay Resolution, and even expediency
dictates that there can be no co-operating with a dying Empire.
            A.I am afraid you are ‘estopped’ from asking the question, if
I may use a legal term. But as you have asked the question, and there
is nothing to hide, I may answer it. In fact I answered it in my speech
before the A. I. C. C.,1 if you listened to it with attention. Well, then, let
me tell you that, though I am old in age, my mind is not decaying. It
is ever growing, and the decision not to divide the house indicates my
growth or evolution in my own non-violence.2 
Mahatma Gandhi said that after he had made his attitude on the question known
since the Bardoli decision, he had come to realize that as the majority of the Working
Committee members, representing, as they do, the large bulk of Congressmen, were
not prepared to go the whole hog with him on the question of non-violence, it would
have become unfair to clinch the issue at Wardha, for he was confident that if he had
insisted upon the question being decided by a vote, a large number of the A.I.C.C.
members, perhaps in spite of their conscience, would have voted in support of his
attitude. That could have been a decision obviously misrepresenting the real
situation. It would have been harmful in the extreme, and hence he decided that he
should plead for the support of the Working Committee’s resolution. Wrong
assumptions could never lead to right results.3
To divide the house appeared to me a piece of violence. If every
one of the members of the A. I. C. C. was a pukka believer in political
non-violence, it would have been a different matter. But I knew that
such was not the case. The Bardoli Resolution was a true reflection of
the Congress mind. In such matters majority and minority do not
count. And there was nothing to prevent the whole-hoggers to go
whatever length they liked.
The contingency of co-operation is, if anything, very remote.

2 The following paragraph is from National Herald .
3 This sentence is from The Hindu .456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIUntil then all have to act in terms of non-violence. When the
contingency does arise the whole-hoggers can secede from the
Congress. In fact we can then meet again and put the whole matter to
vote.
Q.Would it be proper or improper to defend oneself with arms against
atatayis (confirmed offenders) in case of disturbances?
A.The answer has been already given by me and also by the
Congress. And the word atatayi is bad for our purpose. And don’t
ask what is proper and improper. If you were to ask me, I should say it
is improper. If you are non-violent, do not have resort to arms. If you
cannot muster non-violence of the brave, defend yourself as best [as]
you can. The law gives everyone the right of self-defence against a
dacoit, and the Congress does not take away the legal right. But in
riots or communal disturbances, he who calls himself a Congressman
has to act non-violently. That is the resolution of the Congress. Even
there if your courage fails you and you use force, the Congress will
not censure you, for the simple reason that the Congress never
intended to encourage cowardice.
Q.You are said to have permitted khadi bhandars to sell blankets to
Government. It is not co-operation in the war effort?
A.I did. It was not proper for me to ask whether the blankets
were for the use of soldiers or for someone else. The case is different
when a man sells fire-arms or swords or poison. The vendor has to
inquire how the fire-arms are to be used, and the chemist has to ask
for the doctor’s certificate. On the other hand a rice-seller will not,
and is under no obligation to inquire who is going to consume the
rice.1
Admitting that it was very difficult to draw the line of demarcation, Mahatma
Gandhi said the principal criterion from his point of view was for the supplier to
consider how his supply would be utilized. Of course, his view on the question was
not necessarily that of the Congress and Congressmen were free to object to it
without acquiescing in the butchery in which the soldiers were engaged. It was quite
conceivable that the blankets supplied to them served to spare them the hardships of
a severe winter, the more so when they were maimed or wounded in the battle. There
was the underlying humanitarian motive in making these supplies and that could not
be questioned as co-operation in the war effort.
But you may go further than I did. If you think I erred, you are
at liberty to denounce me. If you think a non-violent man may not
sell rice or blankets to soldiers, you are welcome to your interpretation
of non-violence. I for one will not hesitate to give water or food to a
1 The following paragraph is from National Herald .VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 457soldier who comes to me with hands red with murder. My humanity
would not let me do otherwise.
The question of spurious khadi was next discussed, and Gandhiji said :
A great deal depends on intelligent and wide-awake public
opinion. If the public takes it into its mind to prevent the spread of
this khadi, it can easily do so. But we have not cultivated what Lord
Willingdon used to call the courage to say ‘No’. Those who are
interested in khadi are all shareholders of the A. I. S. A., and it is their
duty to take up this work. To feed the hungry and clothe the naked is
our immediate programme, and you have all to lend a hand
effectively. If you all do so, the question of spurious khadi will not
arise. No Congressman can deal in spurious khadi.1
Stressing the importance of Congressmen concentrating on khadi, Mahatma
Gandhi said that by virtue of their commitment to the Congress constructive
programme whereof the khadi movement was the most important part, the
responsibility of clothing Indians in the immediate future was devolving upon the
shoulders of Congressmen and they would soon be tested as to their ability to
discharge it. Inquiries made by him from Indian millowners had revealed that cloth
stocks were very limited and fast diminishing. And such of them as were held were
being manipulated by persons dealing in futures ( satta). Not only the public, said
Mahatma Gandhi, but also the Government of the country would knock at his doors
for more and ever more of khadi in the near future. That time was fast approaching. He
hoped that Congressmen would not be found unprepared to meet the situation.
The last question was about the Congressmen’s duty in times of raids and
scares and consequent disturbances.
The emergency is there today. Dacoities are rampant, and unless
the Congress asserts itself effectively, the situation will go out of our
hands. The need for peace brigades was never more urgent than now.2
The risk of death is there, whether you choose violence or non-
violence. Why not then prepare yourselves to die non-violently? It will
also enable you to offer effective resistance in case of a civil war. As
for the protection of the wounded in air raids, the bulk of the work
will come upon yourselves. You will not join the A. R. P., simply
because you will be then parts of a machine over which you have no
control and you would be active participants in the war effort3. But it
1 The following paragraph is form National Herald .
2 National Herald  add here : “In this connection he said that the danger, far
from lying in the future, was ever present and, saying that his suggestion for the
formation of peace brigades still held the field, he complained that Congressmen had
doubted his seriousness in making it and had dismissed it as impracticable without
earnestly examining its implications and potentialities.”
3 National Herald  adds here : “in regard to which the Congress position had
been already made clear.”458 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIis certain that the Government will not be able to render assistance
everywhere. Did they do so in Rangoon? We have harrowing tales of
the dead and wounded lying on the streets of Rangoon uncared for.
Wherever, therefore, the authorities fail there will be enough scope of
work for us. We have to prepare
            volunteers for this work ready to take risks and to act with
initiative. We may have to remove the dead and wounded, take charge
of vacant houses, and so on. In this work you will heartily co-operate
with the authorities wherever they will accept your co-operation.1
Mahatma Gandhi said that . . . nothing was expected to deter them from
organizing volunteer squads and offering such relief as was possible in emergencies
in co-operation with the Government organization, if necessary, and in spite of it, if
possible, regardless of the consequences. For instance, after an air raid if there were
persons trapped in a crumbling house or a house on fire, it was the duty of
Congressmen to extricate them and pull down the house, lest it should collapse and
take a toll of life, without waiting to see whether the official organization’s aid,
sanction or a request for co-operation was forthcoming.
Mahatma Gandhi was all humour at the conference and Acharya J. B. Kripalani,
General Secretary of the Congress, was the butt of it. Mahatma Gandhi said :
Kripalani was morose formerly, because I thought he was not
married. But, even when he is married and has a very good partner in
life, his mood haunts him.

(a) The proceedings of the Congress, the A.I.C.C. and the Working
Committee shall ordinarily be conducted in Hindustani. The English language
or any Provincial language may be used, if the speaker is unable to speak in
Hindustani or whenever permitted by the President.
(b) The proceedings of the Provincial Congress Committee shall
ordinarily be conducted in the language of the Province concerned. Hindustani
may also be used.
—Article 25 of the Congress Constitution
The Congress has not carried out this resolution to any
appreciable extent. It is a sad reflection. The fault is Congressmen’s.
They will not take the trouble of learning Hindustani. Their effort for
learning languages is evidently exhausted with the performance of the
impossible task of acquiring a knowledge of the English language
equal to a learned Englishman’s. The result is tragic. It has meant
1 What follows is from National Herald .VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 459impoverishment of the provincial languages and displacement of the
all-India language described by the Congress as Hindustani. It has
also meant a break between the millions and the English-educated few
who happen to be the natural leaders for the simple reason that they
are the only educated class. There is no education worth the name
apart from the schools established by the Government. The Congress
has to perform the Herculean task of dissplacing the English language
with Hindustani. With the passing of the resolution it should have
created a bureau for fulfilling, the purpose as it might do even now.
But if it does not, individual Congressmen and those who are
interested in evolving an all-India language should do so.
But what is Hindustani? There is no such language apart from
Urdu and Hindi. Urdu has sometimes been called Hindustani. Did the
Congress mean Urdu in the Article quoted? Did it exclude the more
extensively known Hindi? Such a meaning would be absurd. It
evidently meant, and could only mean, a scientific blend of Hindi and
Urdu. There is no such written blend extant. But it is the common
speech of the unlettered millions of Hindus and Muslims living in
Northern India. Not being written, it is imperfect, and he written
language has taken two different turns tending to widen the difference
by each running away from the other. Therefore the word Hindustani
means Hindi and Urdu. Therefore also Hindi can call itself
Hindustani, if it does not exclude Urdu but tries to assimilate Urdu as
much as is scientifically possible without damaging the natural
structure and music of the original. Urdu can do likewise. There is no
separate Hindustani body attempting to blend the two streams which
today threaten to run away from each other.
The noble task can be performed by the Hindi Sahitya
Sammelan and Anjuman-e-taraqqi-e-Urdu. I have been connected
with the former since 19181 when I was invited to preside at its session
of that year. I aequainted the audience with my views on the all-India
medium. When I presided again at its session in 19352, I was able to
persuade the Sammelan to define Hindi as the language spoken by
Hindus and Muslims of the North of India and written either in
Devanagari or Persian script. The natural consequence should have
been for the members of the Sammelan to expand their knowledge of
Hindi by living up to the definition and producing literature that
1 The source has “1917”; Gandhiji had presided over the Hindi Sahitya
Sammelan in March 1918 in Indore. Vide “Statement of Transvaal Indian Case”,

20-4-1935.460 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcould be read by both Hindus and Muslims. This
             should have meant the members learning the Persian script.
They seem to have denied themselves this proud privilege. But better
late than never. Will they bestir themselves now? They need not wait
for the Anjuman to respond. It will be a great thing, if the Anjuman
does. Each Association can, if it will, work in harmony with the other.
But I have suggested unitary action independent of the other party.
That Association which will adopt my plan will enrich the language it
stands for, and will ultimately be responsible for producing a blend
which will serve the whole nation.
It is unfortunate that the Hindi-Urdu question has assumed a
communal shape. It is possible for either party to undo the mischief
by recognizing the other and incorporating the acceptable part in a
generous spirit. A language that borrows unstintingly from the others
without harming its special characteristic will be enriched, even as the
English language has become enriched by free borrowings.

Harijan, 1-2-1942
720. SPEECH AT CHOKHAMELA BOARDING HOUSE1
NAGPUR,
January 24, 1942
Gandhiji began to address the gathering. There was noise. In a moment a
youth2 sprang to his feet and said : “This is not the ordinary noise. We are protesting
against your coming.” Gandhiji invited him to come to the rostrum and say what he
wanted to say. He had nothing more to say than this : “We do not want you here.
Those who invited you here had no right to do so.” Asked Gandhiji of him :
But why don’t you want me here?
Because you have done nothing for the Harijans.
That’s all? Have you anything more to say?
“Nothing more,” he said, and after a while disappeared.
I am told by the friend who raised the voice of protest that those
who invited me here had no right to do so. The fact is that it was the
students of the Chokhamela3 Boarding House who came to           
Wardha to invite me. I had begged to be excused, but Shri Chaturbhuj

spoke in Hindustani on the occasion of the silver jubilee of the Boarding House. On
his arrival a number of Mahar youths shouted anti-Gandhi slogans.

3 Name of a Harijan saint of the Mahar communityVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 461Jasani intervened and told me that, if the work that carried me to
Benares was after my heart, this might be even dearer in as much as it
was the silver jubilee of an institution that had served Harijan boys.
And since the abolition of untouchability is my life’s work and I even
toured the country for the same cause for one whole year1, I agreed.
But assuming that those who invited me had no right to do so, it
was surely not my fault. These protests do not displease me. The
Harijans have suffered all these centuries at the hands of the savarna
Hindus as from no one else, and as I am one of the latter I am
participant in their sin. And I am never accustomed to weigh my sins
in golden scales. I can atone for them only if I made a mountain of a
molehill. The reason is simple. Man can never see his faults in proper
perspective, and if he really did so, he would scarcely survive them.
The remedy is, therefore, to magnify one’s shortcomings. And the sin
of untouchability is so heinous that it is impossible to exaggerate it.
Those who suffer from it are naturally liable to be angry with those
who are trying to wipe it out. They may well say to me : ‘Who are you
to remove untouchability? We shall wipe it out our own strength.’
Now the way of demonstrating one’s strength is of two kinds : one is
the eternal, God-given way of self-purification, where man takes the
blame upon himself of all the wrongs he is suffering from; the other is
the way of retaliation, the Mosaic law of tooth for a tooth and nail for
a nail. The latter is quite natural in that we have descended from the
state of brutes, and some of their qualities may have been exaggerated
in us. It is Hitler’s way. Because a Jew or many Jews may have
wronged the Germans he thinks it is his duty to exterminate the whole
Jewish race. To those Harijans who would destroy caste Hindus and
Hinduism I would say that the Hindus deserve it. But the caste Hindus
too owe a duty to themselves and their religion. Let them receive lathis
and stones from Harijans. But they should continue to serve them.
What, however, is to be done, if they will not receive our
service?2
Let the stones rain on us, we have to keep quiet and to hold this
meeting. I had promised to stay here for ten minutes, but I am in no
hurry to go now. Send word to the demonstrators that, if they will
have a separate meeting, I am prepared to stay and address that
meeting and answer the charges they may have to make against me.
And what after all is my crime? That I am labouring for them? That I
am endeavouring to put a little money into their pockets? That I am

2 At this stage there was a slight interruption because stones were thrown at
the audience, injuring a few persons.462 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHItelling the sanatanists day in and day out that they have to purge
themselves of their sin? And why rain stones on the innocent
audience?
They wanted to hurt me, but what have they succeeded in
doing? They have hurt a few innocent people including two children
in the audience. If they wanted to punish me or those who invited me,
they should have gone directly for us. Let me tell them that this
hooliganism is the opposite of bravery, humanity, civility. Let me tell
them they are going about the wrong way. They are injuring their
own cause.
Now a word to those assembled here. Though this is a boarding
house, those who receive their board and lodging here are all students.
I hope your stay here will be fruitful and give you what is real
education. Let today’s demonstration be a lesson to you. It should
make you neither angry nor afraid, for anger and fear are twin sins.
Let the demonstration awaken you to your sense of duty and burn the
eternal truth indelibly on your minds that only Truth quenches
untruth, Love, quenches anger, self-suffering quenches violence. This
eternal rule is a rule not for saints only but for all. Those who observe
it may be few but they are the salt of the earth, it is they who keep the
society together, not those who sin against light and truth.
I ask you not only not to punish the demonstrators but not even
to have the wish. They are not wicked. It is through them that God
works to open our eyes to the wickedness within us. Let, therefore,
today’s demonstration purify you, as I know it will purify me. True
vidya (knowledge) is the art of self-purification. Now I want you to
stay here until the storm ceases, lest your going out just now should
infuriate them. Let us wait until their fury ceases, and then quietly go
back to our homes. In the mean while let us all recite Ramdhun
together, let someone give us a hymn, and we shall disperse only when
we are told that everything is quiet outside.1

721. TO GUJARATIS2
You have sacrificed a great deal in the cause of swaraj. But it is
not enough. You can contribute still more in the form of money,
labour, and increasingly intelligent and fresh minds.
Is it not sad that Rs. 2 lakhs worth of khadi only is being
1 Krishnanand Sokhta then invited the audience to join him in reciting
Ramanama and the meeting dispersed peacefully thereafter.
2 The Gujarati original of this appeared in Harijanbandhu , 1-2-1942.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 463produced in Gujarat whereas Rs. 12 lakhs worth is wanted? It may be
that there is not so much poverty in Gujarat as in the other provinces.
But that does not mean that Gujaratis cannot, if they wish, produce all
the khadi they need. Reckoning the population of Gujarat at 1 crore,
the people would need at least 3 crores worth of cloth. You should
produce at least this quantity, i.e., 15 crore yards.
The time is fast approaching when we shall not be able to get
mill-cloth. There is scarcity even today, and what if the mills are
bombed, what if they are used as munition factories? Either each one
of us, young and old, rich and poor, man and woman, has to spin and
provide for his own clothing or else go naked. There is not the least
exaggeration in this. In the warring countries people are rationed for
food and clothing,1 and as the war is prolonged even the necessities of
life are being used up and munitions are produced only to end in
smoke. The war is thus working double destruction.
We have been will-nilly dragged into the vortex. But we are not
yet so hard put to it as the people in the warring countries. If, however,
we sit with folded hands until the trouble comes upon us, we shall be
found to have been fools2. We must be wise and adopt the necessary
measures in time.3
It is my request then to those Gujaratis whose ears I can reach
that they should give as much money and as much yarn as they can to
the Mahagujarat Khadi Mandal. Receiving centres should be opened
where necessary so as to save people the cost of posting yarn. The
master-key to producing the requisite khadi lies in the wheel plying in
every home. If good yarn is spun, weavers will be available, though I
have already advised that we should take time by the forelock and
train voluntary weavers also.
Will every Congressman rise to the occasion and spin for the
nation?

As Sardar Vallabhbhai was leaving Sevagram the other day he
told me of a dacoity in a home2 in Kheda District. Armed dacoits
entered the house, belaboured the inmates, and escaped with the loot.
The story was heart-rending. What should I do under similar
circumstances, I thought to myself. What should Congressmen do in
the circumstances was the next thought; and since then the train of
thought arising from the dacoity has taken possession of me. The
Congress has been working continuously since 1920 under the policy
of non-violence. The province of Gujarat has also had the advantage
of a leader of the Sardar’s calibre. And yet daring dacoities can take
place. How far then can Congress influence be said to have
penetrated? People imagine that, if the British Government were to
cease to function today, it would be the non-violent Congressmen who
would automatically take over. But it is not so. I have been working to
this end for the last twenty years, but my dream has not materialized.
For the Congress has not had a living faith in the very means which it
adopted in 1920. Therefore the non-violence of the Congress has
really been non-violence of the weak. But governments can only be
run by the strong. And a non-violent government can only be run by
those who believe that non-violence is the mightiest force on earth. If
we had had this strength, there would be no HinduMuslim riots, there
would be no robbers or dacoits. Some might say that for such strength
you need either a Jesus or a Buddha. But this is not so. Neither Jesus
nor Buddha tried non-violence in the political sphere, or it would be
truer to say that the present-day type of politics did not exist in their
day. The Congress experiment is, therefore, a new one. The tragedy is
that Congressmen have not tried it with full faith, full understanding
and sincerity. If they had had these three essential qualities, the
Congress would today have been far taller than it is. But I may not cry
over spilt milk. I refer to the past only in order to guide us in the
present. Even if we wake up now, the game is ours; if we do not, we
shall surely lose. Power invariably elects to go into the hands of the
strong. That strength may be physical or of the heart, or, if we do not
fight shy of the word, of the spirit. Strength of the heart connotes soul
force. If today we decide that we should try to get power by force of
arms, we shall have to undo all the work of twenty years among the
masses. We shall have to spend a considerable time in giving people a
contrary training. We cannot afford to give the required time at this

2 The house of one JesangbhaiVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 465critical juncture. It is certain that today whoever has any strength of
any kind will use it for seizing power. It is my firm conviction that, if
Congressmen are to get power, it should only be through non-
violence or soul force.
We have neither time nor material to do new work even in this
line. When we have so far employed non-violence as a weapon of the
weak, how can we all of a sudden expect to convert it into a weapon of
the strong? But in spite of this I feel that at the present moment this
experiment alone is feasible and proper for us. There is no risk
involved in it. Even failure in it takes the form of success because,
even if the people are not able to go the whole length in the
experiment, they cannot possibly be led into a ditch. By following the
way of physical force they may not only be proved cowards, but in
attempting to follow an untrodden path thousands may also be
destroyed.
It is then the duty of Congressmen to seek out dacoits and
robbers. They should try to understand and convert them. Such
workers cannot be had for the asking; but Congressmen should know
that this work is just as important as it is fraught with risk, and a
certain number of them have to devote themselves to it.
The second thing requisite is that we should prepare such
workers as would, under difficult circumstances, stand up to dacoits
and, whilst trying to check or convert them from their evil ways, be
prepared to suffer hurt or even death. Perhaps few workers will be
forthcoming for this task too, but peace brigades throughout the
country are a definite necessity. Or else in times of chaos
Congressmen will lose all the reputation they have so far gained1 .
Thirdly, the rich should ponder well as to what is their duty
today. They who employ mercenaries to guard their wealth may find
those very guardians turning on them. The monied classes
            have got to learn how to fight either with arms or with the
weapon of non-violence. For those who wish to follow the latter way
the best and most effective mantra is : —2 (Enjoy thy
wealth by renouncing it.) Expanded, it means : ‘Earn your crores by
all means. But understand that your wealth is not yours; it belongs to
the people. Take what you require for your legitimate needs, and use
the remainder for society.’ This truth has hitherto not been acted
upon; but, if the monied classes do not even act on it in these times of
1 The Gujarati here adds, “and whatever we have achieved till now will be
undone”.
2 Ishopanishad , 1466 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIstress, they will remain the slaves of their riches and passions and
consequently of those who overpower them.
But I have visions that the end of this war will mean also the end
of the rule of capital. I see coming the day of the rule of the poor,
whether that rule be through force of arms or of non-violence. Let it
be remembered that1 physical force is transitory even as the body is
transitory. But the power of the spirit is permanent, even as the spirit is
everlasting.

UNITARY METHOD
Q.You seem to be advocating what you call the unitary method in the
solution of many questions. Will you explain it a little more fully than you have
done?
A.It is as simple as it is sure. A contract or pact is between two
parties. There is also consideration passing from one to the other.
Such was the Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the Muslim
League. The same thing could have been accomplished by the unitary
method. Only then there would have been no compromise dictated by
fear and distrust. The Congress could have done, according to its
notion, absolute justice, i.e., yielded the maximum consistent with the
welfare of the whole nation without the expectation of any conside-
ration from the League. In a well-regulated family the relations are
governed by the unitary method. Thus a father gives to his children
not as a result of a pact. He gives out of love, a sense of justice without
expecting any return therefor. Not that there is none. But everything
is natural, nothing is forced. Nothing is done out of fear or distrust.
What is true of a well-regulated family is equally true of a well-
regulated society which is but an extended family. My advice about
the adoption of two scripts by Hindus and Muslims is based on the
unitary method. My equal love for all communities dictates its adop-
tion. Properly applied, the method never fails. It disarms criticism and
opposition. It presupposes a clean conscience and clean action. I pro-
pose to unfold in these columns the application of the method in all
our communal relations. The views will be personal to me, as are all
such since the Bardoli Resolution. They will be addressed to Con-
gressmen for adoption only in so far as they appeal to their reason.
RAJAJI
Q.What has come over Rajaji? You and he seem to be drifting away from
each other.
A.Yes, we seem to be and yet we are not. The seeming drift is
but a prelude to a closer bond and clearer understanding. His loyalty
is above suspicion. He would have gladly suppressed himself, if I had
not strongly encouraged him to propound his views with a view to
their adoption by the public. We owe allegiance to the same goddess.
Our interpretations differ. If he is erring, he will retrace his steps as
soon as he discovers it. And he knows that I would do likewise, if I472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdiscover mine. I feel, therefore, absolutely safe with him, and I ask all
questioners to do likewise.
UNTRUTH
Q.Do you know that you are reported to have said at Benares that it is sinful
for any Indian ever to study or speak in English and you are charged with insincerity
in that you make such liberal use of the hated language when it suits you?
A.The report is wholly untrue. But once an untruth gets a start
it is most difficult to overtake. Many untruths about me have had such
a start. They created a temporary sensation and got a decent burial
without any effort on my part. So will this one. No untruth has ever
done any harm to anyone if there was no bottom to it. I am answering
the question, not to protect my reputation but to carry my point
further. The charge of insincerity is itself the best refutation of the
untruth. For my free use of the English language is not a thing of
today. The charge should have been regarded as unworthy of belief.
Let it be known that I am a lover of the English language and the
English. But my love is wise and intelligent. Therefore I give both the
place they deserve. Thus I do not allow the English language to dis-
place the mother tongue or the natural all-India language—Hindus-
tani. Nor do I let my love of the English displace my fellow-country-
men whose interest I can in no way allow to be injured. I recognize
the great importance of the English language for international
intercourse. I hold its knowledge as a second language to be indispen-
sable for specified Indians who have to represent the country’s
interest in the international domain. I regard the English language as
an open window for peeping into Western thought and sciences. For
this too I should set apart a class. Through them I would spread
through the Indian languages the knowledge they have gained from
the West. But I would not burden India’s children and sap their
youthful energy by expecting the expansion of their brains through
the medium of a foreign language. I do hold it to be a sin on the part
of those who are responsible for producing the unnatural condition
under which we are being educated. Such a thing is unknown in any
other part of the world. Being too near the scene of the wreck we are
unaware of the damage the nation has suffered by it. I can see the
enormity of the damage because of my daily and close contact with
the dumb and suppressed millions.
ANOTHER UNTRUTH
Q.You are reported by the Press to have approvingly referred to the progress
made by the Japanese in adopting Western methods with a thoroughness hitherto
unknown in the East. Is not this a contradiction of all you have written about the
West? Or is there one law for India and another for Japan?VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 473A.This is another untruth like the one about the English
language. The reader will find out for himself from Mahadev Desai’s
report of my Benares speech1 as to what I actually said about the
Japanese. The burden of my speech was the undesirability of making
English the medium of instruction and all-India speech. I said in this
connection that, however harmful in my opinion the Japanese
adaptation of the West was, the rapid progress was due to the restric-
tion of the learning of the Western mode to a select few and using
them for transmission of the new knowledge among the Japanese
through their own mother tongue. Surely it is easy enough to under-
stand that the Japanese could never have adapted themselves to the
new mode, if they had had to do so through a foreign medium.

CHI. LILI,
I am replying to your letter the moment I got it. I did not like
your account of how you were working. I have told you a thousand
times not to get impatient. Whatever knowledge you acquire will not
be wasted. You should thoroughly understand the subjects. Learn
only what you can without over-exerting yourself. Have a talk with
your Principal and other professors. Let me know what they say. I
would not at all like your giving up your studies. I am not keen that
you should take the examination this year. Of course if you can do so
without difficulty, you may. But I should regard it as sheer folly and
theft of public money for you to benumb your brain by keeping
awake at night and drinking pots of tea. A person like you ought not
to throw away money like this.

SEVAGRAM ,
January 29, 1942
I have something to say about the manner in which you just
came and sat here.2 The task before us is so great and pure that it
should influence our manner of speech as well as movement, in fact
all our actions as well as thoughts. When we assemble to hear someone
we should sit in a decent posture, without being huddled together.
And we should make it a point to sit up straight and erect and in an
attentive posture. The way you are huddled together, one upon
another, shows a lack of manners, of culture. Every tradition has its
own definite style of deportment. In Western countries, people sit on
chairs in a prescribed manner. The military training they receive also
influences their style. We also have our own concept of good
manners. But we have forgotten it. We have learnt nothing new from
the West. That is why our plight is like Trishanku’s3, neither here nor
there. We have our own code of postures, which helps make physical
as well as spiritual progress. It is something we can offer the world
provided we assimilate it in our lives. But we have now grown indo-
lent. This is about the ancient Hindu tradition. The Arabs too have
their own code of etiquette. They also have a graceful manner of
sitting and rising. Their prayers too are offered in their own
prescribed style. In short, the only purpose of my saying all this is that
whatever we do should have a method about it—a code to govern it. If
you fulfil the expectations entertained about you, you can surpass the
students of Government schools or colleges. In my view the
importance of this Vidyalaya is not less but in fact more than that of a
school or college. You are judged also by the way you lie and sit, by
the manner and matter of your talk. Every action of a man from the
cradle to the grave should be steeped in his culture. I would like to see
your own culture in every one of your actions. It is not enough for
you merely to learn spinning and weaving; it is only a means.
Two things are most essential for man to subsist. One is food
and the other clothing. There are three ways of solving the problem of
food and clothing. One of them is to get them in the form of charity.
But it is not proper. It does not mitigate the poverty of the people. On
1 After the evening prayer Gandhiji addressed the students from different
provinces who had one month’s training at the Vidyalaya.
2 There was some confusion when the students took their seats at the meeting.
3 Who hung between heaven and earthVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 475the contrary, it makes beggars of them. The other way is to take up
employment and earn wages with which to subsist. This too makes us
dependent. The third way is to arrange the production of food and
clothing. This can be done in two ways. Either through spinning-
wheels or through mechanized factories. By mass-producing the
goods we can certainly become self-dependent collectively, but not
individually. In case of air-raids where will they drop the bombs if not
on the workshops and factories? Certainly not on the [small] dwelling
units where taklis and spinning-wheels are plying. If eventually we are
left with no other means of producing cloth, we shall be obliged to
depend on others for our needs. And if the factories are diverted to
the manufacture of ammunitions, there will be no other means but the
spinning-wheel left with us.
All this can happen in future. If we can foresee it we should
provide for it right from today. Today we need khadi worth one
billion rupees, out of which we shall be able to produce at the most
khadi worth one crore. It is no great achievement in my view. You are
being trained here so that when you leave you may teach the people
to produce their own requirements and stand on their own legs.
Today if someone comes to me even after passing his M.A., I
would ask him too what his ultimate aim in life was. What does he
want to do? Employment of some sort, isn’t it? To secure employ-
ment and earn his bread. But that is not your aim. If you come here to
be trained so that you can earn your bread you cannot interest a man
like me. Here is before you a course covering one year, not several as
in the schools and colleges. The aim is to devise a scheme by which
the whole of India, every single man in the country, can stand on his
own feet. By producing cloth in the mills the money does not go to
the poor but it moves from the poor man’s pocket into the rich
man’s. On the other hand, if I buy khadi, I transfer some money to
the poor and help them to be self-reliant. In this way if we succeed in
making them self-reliant in one matter alone, they will themselves
learn to be so in all other matters. Khadi is like the carpenter’s set
square. When with its help he corrects one angle, the remaining angles
stand corrected in consequence. In the same way, if we could establish
khadi, many other things would take root without special effort on our
part. As a result of the work we have done for khadi, many village
industries have now been revived and the activities of the A. I. V. I. A.
are gaining ground. If you look at khadi work from this angle, you
will realize what splendid thing khadi is and consequently your work
and its impact too will be equally splendid.476 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIBear in mind that you are learning the way of filling the poor
man’s pocket and not your family’s. If we fail to appreciate this
point, we all shall have to repent in the end. You had better look out
now, quit this work and take up another profession or employment.
In this context, I have deliberately omitted to mention the
country’s independence and politics, although they are all intercon-
nected. If we could make the poor people of India self-reliant in
necessaries, swaraj will be within our reach. In my view, that alone
would be real swaraj, and nothing else. If you will go through Shri
Rajendra Babu’s recent essay on constructive programme you will
know what an important role khadi has in the struggle for indepen-
dence.
Those of you who are leaving today should understand that
whatever they have learnt or done here during these four weeks is
nothing more than superficial introduction. They must increase their
knowledge. If you have not developed a scientific outlook, if you
have not learnt to think the scientific way, you will not be able to
develop whatever you have gained here, nor will you be able to fulfil
the expectations entertained of you. Here you have been entrusted
with a key to a store of knowledge and if you have learnt to use it, I
trust you will draw from that store new things every day and enrich
yourselves.
A teacher who establishes rapport with the taught, becomes one
with them, learns more from them than he teaches them. He who
learns nothing from his disciples is, in my opinion, worthless. When-
ever I talk with someone I learn from him. I take from him more than
I give him. In this way, a true teacher regards himself as a student of
his students. If you will teach your pupils with this attitude, you will
benefit much from them.
In my opinion the late Maganlal Gandhi was such an ideal khadi
worker. He proved his worth beyond my expectations. Even strugg-
ling against the most formidable difficulties, he used to learn some-
thing useful to him wherever he could. He was neither afraid nor tired
of hardships. Till his death he engaged himself in learning more and
more about khadi. I want you to follow in your life this ideal of
Maganlal Gandhi. Remember, if on returning to your home provinces
you do not develop the knowledge acquired here, you will lose very
soon what you carry with you. If you want to develop your know-
ledge, know that it can grow only by teaching it to the others. If you
continue to be such progressive and brilliant workers you will, I am
sure, grow from 13 to 130 in a very short time.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 477So, I am placing a great burden on the teachers who are leaving
this place today. Please carry it with you. From wherever you will go
and work I expect to hear that you are honest gentlemen and devoted
servants of the country.
If anyone wants to ask any question he may do so.
Q.What should a khadi worker do to guard himself against lethargy and
pride?
GANDHIJI : He should spin regularly and attentively for eight
hours every day without a break. If, while plying the wheel, he thinks
only of service to Daridranarayana , pride will not be able to cast its
shadow on him, and how can lethargy remain?
Q.What should a khadi worker do in case his subordinates do not carry out
his instructions? Should he punish them? Should he get angry?
GANDHIJI : He should try to convert them through patience with-
out losing his temper. It has been my experience that when I become
angry, I fail to convince. Anger is an enemy of reason. That is why we
should not lose temper. Similarly, we cannot also mete out punish-
ment. If any punishment is necessary, we should ourselves undertake a
fast. But if the interest of khadi work demands it, the person con-
cerned can be relieved.

I have your letter. Your work there seems to be going on quite
well.
You did well to draw my attention to my habit of talking too
much. I will continue to call you silly, but I will bear in mind your
criticism. You cite the remarks of others in support of your criticism
and they too will caution me.1 I do admit that there is substance in one
point. My past experiences are no valid arguments. They may give me
strength, but as arguments their value is limited. If the experiments in
the past were based on error, the error is not mitigated but multiplied
by repeating those experiments.
I plead completely guilty to your second charge. I am in no
position now to write long and interesting letters. I can do that only if
I went to jail. Nor can I talk interestingly. The pressure on my time
has become much too heavy for that.
Lakshmibai is leaving today. I like her very much. Her health is
fully restored.

I have been asked which way my sympathy lies. From a purely
humanitarian point of view, undoubtedly, it is all with England. I do
not wish that the British should be defeated, nor do I wish the defeat
of the Germans. There will be very little meaning and charm for us in
the rest of the world if an entire people, to whichever nation they
belong, remain downtrodden, humiliated and embittered. Will not
bitterness in any one nation constitute seeds of a future war? Whatever
it is, if the present war continues till the bitter end, civilization itself
will be reduced to ashes in this conflagration. Let us pray that it will
stop before it is too late. Still, can it stop so long as there is hatred in
the hearts of men? If I have hatred for even one individual, will it not
imperceptibly spread to all his countrymen? Of course, there is ample
reason for condemning the German dictator. But if I wish that armies
bid farewell to arms and refrain from bloodshed—since this is the
only meaning and message of ahimsa—I should adhere to my con-
viction and should have no hatred for any living human being.
Although I am pained at his deeds, I can have no hatred even for
Adolf Hitler.

737. DHANUSH TAKLI
I think dhanush takli is going to play a big role in the
constructive programme. Today I am not going to enter into the
relative merits and demerits of dhanush takli  and the spinning-wheel.
I am convinced that we cannot manufacture spinning-wheels by
thousands. It requires plenty of money which we do not have. Nor can
they be manufactured at every place. They are also hardly portable.
It is not possible either to make good taklis at every place, nor
can we spin fast with them.
That leaves only the dhanush takli  which can be made with little
labour and less money. We can also spin fast with it.
Therefore, I request all khadi workers to study the dhanush
takli, learn to make it and popularize it.
Manufacture of new spinning-wheels should be postponed for
the time being. By all means make the best use of the existing ones.
Those who can and wish to manufacture the spinning-wheels locally480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImay do so. But in order to create an atmosphere for dhanush takli  all
the new spinners should be supplied with dhanush taklis  only.
All khadi workers should peruse from Harijan my article1 on
the subject.

739. SPEECH AT ALL-INDIA GOSEVA SANGH CONFERENCE2
WARDHA,
February 1, 1942
Gandhiji with biting irony . . . cast . . . lurid light on the worship of the cow
as seen in the streets of Bombay.
We catch her by the tail and sanctify our eyes with its sacred
touch. We regard even her urine as sacred and full of medicinal value
and drink it. Alas, the poor cow is innocent of all this worship, and so
our worship is lost on her. It even scares her. When it scares her she
answers our attentions with a kick; when she is not scared she suffers
us. . . .
All this is too true and those who claim to protect the cow betray
a criminal ignorance of the real method of protecting her and her
progeny. Those who claim to worship the cow cruelly ill-treat the
bullocks. Chaunde Maharaj has been working at the problem assidu-
ously for years, but whilst he accepts my facts and even argument, he
says, ‘What about the public sentiment? They somehow want to save
the cow from the butcher.’ But they go about the wrong way and
succeed in defeating the very object they are trying to achieve. I do

understanding of the essentials of the problem betrayed by most of
the people who run our pinjrapoles1 dismay me.
He referred in passing to the wrong way of protecting the cow from a Mussal-
man wanting to slaughter her, and said that he would repeat ad nauseam  that to quarrel
with the Mussalman and to kill him in order to protect the cow was to instigate more
slaughter.
The whole milk and ghee trade is in the hands of the Hindus.
But have we been able to ensure a supply of pure milk and ghee? The
milk is adulterated, and even the water used for adulteration is not
clean. The cruel and criminal process of phooka2 is well known. The
ghee sold in the market can often be described as poison rather than
ghee. The butter we get from New Zealand, Australia or Denmark is
guaranteed pure cow’s butter, but there is no guarantee about the
butter or ghee available here. There is not a shop in Wardha, where
some of us are keen on this problem, where one could go and buy a
seer of cow’s ghee of guaranteed purity.3
I therefore say that if I can really protect the cow by adopting
proper ways and means, I would protect the rest of the animals. But it
can be done only if we know the true science and economy of it. Only
then shall we be able to interest Perinbehn in the problem.4 I am
amazed at our partiality for buffalo’s milk and ghee. Our economics
is short-sighted. We look at the immediate gain, but we do not realize
that in the last analysis the cow is the more valuable animal. Cow’s
butter (and  ghee) has a naturally yellowish colour which indicates its
superiority to buffalo’s butter (and ghee) in carotene. It has a flavour
all its own. Foreign visitors who come to Sevagram go into raptures
over the pure cow’s milk they get there. Buffalo’s milk and butter are
almost unknown in Europe. It is only in India that one finds a
prejudice in favour of buffalo’s milk and ghee. This has spelt all but
extinction of the cow, and that is why I say that, unless we put an
1 Place where aged and infirm cattle are cared for
2 Blowing
3 Mahadev Desai introduces the next paragraph with the following note :
“Every animal—in fact all life—is sacred and should be protected, but unless we really
protect the one that was most valuable in national economy, other animals could not
be protected. In our neglect of the cow we had brought both the cow and the buffalo at
death’s door.”
4 Perinbehn Captain, on being invited to the conference, had declined saying :
“None of this travesty of worship for me. I might attend when you have put it on a
rational footing and shown by concrete work that the Hindus really care for the cow.
And if you will protect the cow, why not the horse and the dog too—both of them
equally noble?”482 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIexclusive emphasis on the cow, she cannot be saved. It is a tragedy
that all the cows and buffaloes put together cannot give us enough
milk for the 40 crores of our people. We ought to realize the value of
the cow as a giver of milk and the mother of draught and agricultural
cattle. And how far is one to pamper popular prejudices? A cow
proves valuable even if she dies, if we would make use of the skin, the
bone, the flesh, the entrails and so on. But the good Chaunde Maharaj
wonders if people can be persuaded to believe that dead cow’s hide is
sacred. Why not? I would not hesitate to go into my house with shoes
made of dead cow’s hide, provided of course the shoes are clean. I
should not hesitate to have my meal with such clean shoes on. I have
to do all this in order to show that the cow is an asset and not a
liability. Today in many places they bury dead cows or sell them away
for a song. We despise the Harijans who eat carrion, but we forget that
it is due to our own fault. If we treated the hide properly, if we knew
the manurial value of the flesh, and the use of the bone and the
entrails—which we are demonstrating at Nalwadi—there would be no
carrion-eating.
Ever since my return to India from South Africa I have been
harping on the question of the reform of pinjrapoles. Unless we
realize and define their proper functions, they are sure to remain the
economic waste they are. Their proper function is to take care of dry,
old and disabled cows, of which individual owners cannot possibly
take care—certainly not in towns and cities. Their function is not that
of a dairy—though they may run a separate dairy if they can—but the
care of the old and the disabled animals, and to provide the raw
material for a tannery. There should be a well-equipped tannery
attached to every pinjrapoles. They should maintain the best stud-
bulls and loan them out for public use, they should provide every
facility for the humane and scientific castration of bulls to be turned
into bullocks, and there should be instruction centres for the agricul-
turist and the dairy farmer. Here is plenty of scope for our agricul-
tural and dairy graduates who should receive additional training for
the special work and then be attached to every one of our pinjrapoles.
All the pinjrapoles should then be affiliated to our Association which
should be the central institution for expert advice, collection and co-
ordination of information and statistics, and so on. The Association
has made it a rule to have as its members those who take the following
pledge :
I agree with the object and means of the Association.
I promise to use cow’s milk and its products exclusively, except for
medical purposes or under unavoidable circumstances or in the articles of food
containing milk and its products in a negligible quantity. I will refrain fromVOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 483the use of the leather of slaughtered cows, bullocks and calves.
I will donate a sum of rupee one or 2,000 yards of self-spun yarn to the
Association every year.
Do not magnify the so-called difficulties and the embarrassment
you would cause to your hosts. You can go about with cow’s ghee
wherever you go—as Kakasaheb does—or you can do without it. It
will be good propaganda, and you may succeed in converting your
hosts also. But duty is not always easy of performance. To run away
from it is the opposite of manliness, opposite of humanity.1
Answering a question, Gandhiji said that goseva formed part of the cons-
tructive programme of the Congress.
Mahatma Gandhi appealed to the audience to stabilize and organize pinjra-
poles. Even Muslims could co-operate in this cow-protection and preservation work,
as it would increase milch cattle, give nutrition and preserve a good supply of
bullocks for cultivation.
Unless you offer your full co-operation to Jamnalalji, especially
on the question of pinjrapoles, his best efforts cannot succeed. Today
the cow is on the brink of extinction, and I am not sure that our
efforts will ultimately succeed. But if she dies, we also die along with
her—we, i.e., our civilization. I mean our essentially non-violent and
rural civilization. We have, therefore, to make our choice. We can
choose to be violent and kill all uneconomic cattle. Like Europe we
should then breed our cattle for the purposes of milk and meat. But
our civilization is fundamentally different. Our life is wrapped up in
our animals. Most of our villagers live with their animals, often under
the same roof. Both live together, both starve together. Often enough
the owner starves the poor cattle, exploits them, ill-treats them,
unmercifully extracts work out of them. But if we reform our ways, we
can both be saved. Otherwise we sink together, and it is just as well that
we swim or sink together.
The question today is to solve the problem of our starvation and
poverty, but I have confined myself to the problem of the starvation
and poverty of our cattle. Our rishis2 showed us the sovereign remedy.
‘Protect the cow,’ they said, ‘and you protect all.’ We have to add to
the talents they have left us, and not to waste them. We have invited the
experts,3 and we shall make every use of their advice. Nothing that we
laymen say is final, we shall get the experts to test it with their

Assuming the presence of the will among the millions, rapid
spread of hand-spinning is possible only by the adoption of the
following three things :
1.Use of unginned cotton from the nearest spot when it is not
grown on one’s own plot.
2.Ginning it on a polished board with an iron or smooth
wooden rod and carding the cotton by manipulation of the cotton
with fingers assisted by a wooden knife made on the spot. This
process is called tunai ().
3.Spinning the slivers on the dhanush takli .
Hand-gins cannot be manufactured to order today. All available
unginned cotton should be prepared first by the method explained in
2 above.
Where unginned cotton is not available ginned cotton from
factories has got to be used. It too lends itself to tunai, though much
more time is required for carding by the tunai process when bale
cotton has to be used. Where a carding-bow is available, naturally it
will be used. But what is true of ginning is equally true of carding. It
is not possible to manufacture bows and gut in a moment. Tunai is a
method devised and being perfected by Shri Vinoba with an artist’s
skill and ardour.
When spinning spreads among the millions it will be impossible
to supply slivers from a centre or centres. The utmost that is possible
is for families or groups to set apart one or two hands per a fixed
number for carding. The ideal, the best, and in the long run the
quickest, way is for each one to prepare his own slivers. It makes
spinning more interesting, and the variety of occupation breaks the
monotony.
I suggest that, though the crisis is not yet felt and the mills are
working, khadi workers will do well from now to adopt the
suggestions I have made. When the crisis does come, we shall then be
found ready.

Harijan, 22-2-1942VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 485741. HINDI + URDU = HINDUSTANI
The following letter1 was written on the 29th ultimo and sent to
me by its writer by registered post. It was received at Sevagram on the
31st ultimo :
The writer has signed the letter, but as it is marked personal I
refrain from giving his name. In any case the name does not matter.
What the writer says is, I know, the belief held by many Muslims. My
repudiation has not undone the mischief.
But my article2 which was written on the 23rd ultimo and has
appeared in Harijan of the 1st instant, should soothe the writer so far
as I am concerned.
I entirely agree with my correspondent that all who want one all-
India speech should today learn both the forms—Hindi and Urdu.
Those who do will ultimately give us a common language. That form
which is more popular and more understood by the masses, whether
Hindu or Muslim, will surely be the all-India speech. But if my
proposal finds general acceptance, the language question will cease to
be a political issue or a bone of contention.
I do not subscribe to the correspondent’s statement that Urdu is
“more developed, more beautiful, more attractive, more concise, and
more expressive”. No language is intrinsically all that the corres-
pondent says. A language becomes what its speakers and writers make
it. English had no merit apart from what Englishmen made it. In other
words, a language is a human creation and takes the colour of its
creators. Every language is capable of infinite expansion. Modern
Bengali is what Bankim3 and Rabindranath have made it. If, therefore,
it is true that Urdu is more everything than Hindi, it is because its
creators are abler than those of Hindi. I can give no opinion, for I
have not studied either as a linguist. I know just enough of both for
my public work.
But is Urdu a language distinct from Hindi as, say, Bengali is
from Marathi? Is not Urdu a direct descedant of Hindi, written in the
Persian character with a tendency to borrow new words from Persian
and Arabic rather than Sanskrit? If there was no estrangement between
the two communities, such a phenomenon would have been

of Hindi in the name of Hindustani.

3 Bankimchandra Chatterjee486 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwelcomed. And when the animosities have died out, as they will one
day, our descendants will laugh at our quarrels and will be proud of
the common Hindustani speech which will be a mixture of words
indifferently borrowed from many languages according to the tastes
and equipment of its multitude of writers and speakers.
Let me correct one misimpression of my correspondent. He
seems to think that Hindustani will finally displace all the provincial
languages. That is neither my dream nor of those who have been
thinking of an all-India speech. Their dream is that Hindustani should
displace English which has almost become a common medium of
communication between the educated classes resulting in a gulf being
created between them and the masses. The tragedy can be prevented
only if the common speech spoken by the largest number of India’s
inhabitants is adopted as the interprovincial speech. The fight,
therefore, is not between Hindi and Urdu, but between the two on the
one hand and English on the other. The result is a foregone
conclusion in spite of the heavy handicap that the sisters are labouring
under, not to speak of the temporary mutual quarrel.
My correspondent quarrels with my connection with the Hindi
Sahitya Sammelan. I am proud of my connection with that body. It
has a record of which it has no reason to be ashamed. The name Hindi
was common to both the communities. Both have written in Hindi and
promoted its growth. Evidently my correspondent is ignorant of what
my connection with that body has meant. It was under my instigation
that it wisely, and shall I say patriotically and generously, adopted the
definition of Hindi to cover Urdu. He asks whether I ever joined an
Urdu Anjuman. I have never been seriously asked to join any. If I
was, I would have made a stipulation with my inviters similar to the
one I made with those who induced me to preside at the Hindi Sahitya
Sammelan. I would have asked the Urdu-speaking inviters to let me
ask the audience to define Urdu so as to include Hindi speech written
in Devanagari script. No such luck came my way.
But now, as I have already hinted in my article of the 1st instant
already referred to, I would like to form an association advocating the
learning of both forms of speech and both the scripts by its members
and carrying on propaganda to that end in the hope finally of a
natural fusion of the two becoming a common interprovincial speech
called Hindustani. Then the equation would be not Hindustani =
Hindi + Urdu, but Hindustani = Hindi = Urdu.

Harijan, 8-2-1942VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 487742. THE ASHRAM PRAYER1
The Ashram prayer has become very popular. Its development
has been spontaneous. The Ashram Bhajanavali2 (Hymn Book) has
gone into several editions and is increasingly in demand. The birth
and growth of this prayer has not been artificial. There is a history
attached to almost every shloka and every selected bhajan. The
Bhajanavali  contains among others bhajans from Muslim Sufis and
Fakirs, from Guru Nanak, and from the Christian Hymnary. Every
religion seems to have found a natural setting in the prayer book.
Chinese, Burmese, Jews, Ceylonese, Muslims, Parsis, Europeans
and Americans have all lived in the Ashram from time to time. In the
same way two Japanese sadhus came to me in Maganwadi in 1935.
One of them was with me till the other day when war broke out with
Japan. He was an ideal inmate of our home in Sevagram. He took part
in every activity with zest. I never heard of his quarrelling with
anyone. He was a silent worker. He learnt as much Hindi as he could.
He was a strict observer of his vows. Every morning and evening he
could be seen going round with his drum and heard chanting his
mantra. The evening worship always commenced with his mantra 
, which means “I bow to the Buddha, the giver of true
religion.” I shall never forget the quickness, the orderliness, and utter
detachment with which he prepared himself the day the police came
without notice to take him away from the Ashram. He took leave of
me after reciting his favourite mantra and left his drum with me.
“You are leaving us, but your mantra will remain an integral part of
our Ashram prayer,” were the words that came spontaneously to my
lips. Since then, in spite of his absence, our morning and evening
worship has commenced with the mantra. For me it is a constant
reminder of Sadhu Keshav’s purity and single-eyed devotion. Indeed
its efficacy lies in that sacred memory.
While Sadhu Keshav was still with us, Bibi Raihana Tyabji also
came to stay at Sevagram for a few days. I knew her to be a devout
Muslim but was not aware, before the death of her illustrious father, of
how well-versed she was in Koran Sharif. When that jewel of Gujarat,
Tyabji Saheb, expired no sound of weeping broke the awful silence in
his room. The latter echoed with Bibi Raihana’s sonorous recitation of
verses from the Koran. Such as Abbas Tyabji Saheb cannot die. He is
1 The Hindi original of this appeared in Harijan Sevak , 8-2-1942.
2 Vide “Ashram Bhajanavali”, 15-12-1930.488 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIever alive in the example of national service which he has left behind.1
Bibi Raihana is an accomplished singer with an ample repertory of
bhajans of all kinds. She used to sing daily as well as recite beautiful
verses from the Koran. I asked her to teach some verses to any of the
inmates who could learn them, and she gladly did so. Like so many
who come here she had become one of us. Raihana went away when
her visit was over, but she has left a fragrant reminder of herself. The
well-known ‘al Fateha’ has been included in the Ashram worship. The
following is a translation of it.
1.I take refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed.
2.Say : He is God, the one and only
God, the Eternal, Absolute,
He begetteth not nor is He begotten,
And there is none like unto Him.
3.Praise be to God,
The Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds,
Most Gracious, most Merciful,
Master of the Day of Judgment,
Thee do we worship
And Thine aid we seek.
Show us the straight way,
The way of those on whom
Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace,
Those whose (portion) is not wrath
And who go not astray.
I am writing this note in reply to an ardent Hindu friend who
has thus gently reproached me : “You have now given the Kalma a
place in the Ashram. What further remains to be done to kill your
Hinduism?”
I am confident that my Hinduism and that of the other Ashram
Hindus has grown thereby. There should be in us an equal reverence
for all religions. Badshah Khan, whenever he comes, joins in the
worship here with delight. He loves the tune which the Ramayana  is
sung, and he listens intently to the Gita. His faith in Islam has not
lessened thereby. Then why may I not listen to the Koran with equal
reverence and adoration in my heart?
1 The Hindi here has : “On her arrival I said to Raihana jestingly, ‘You convert
the Ashram inmates to Islam. I shall convert you to Hinduism.”VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 489Vinoba and Pyarelal studied Arabic and learnt the Koran in jail.
Their Hinduism has been enriched by this study. I believe that Hindu-
Muslim unity will come only through such spontaneous mingling of
hearts and no other. Rama is not known by only a thousand names.
His names are innumerable, and He is the same whether we call Him
Allah, Khuda, Rahim, Razaak, the Bread-giver, or any name that
comes from the heart of a true devotee.

Unrevised Silence Day, February 2, 1942
CHI. JAMNALAL,
Your question deserves to be considered. Does the Goseva
Sangh belong to Hinduism or is it a public institution? If it is a public
institution, then do all religions accept it, or will they? If it is not a
sectarian body, then we should try to draw to it followers of all
religions.
Your list does not contain names of persons from different
provinces; there is nothing like goseva in the South nor in Bengal and
the Punjab. Is no one from these places to be included?
Of late I have not come in contact with Chaunde Maharaj, but
my experience of him is not quite encouraging. He has one or two
workers who are good. My attitude is to accept from him whatever
help he can give. He has his own institution. It should not be inter-
fered with. We should learn from each other, and have a fraternal
feeling.
Yes, there ought to be a woman. By all means do have
Manibehn. It will be very difficult to get Rajkumari. At home it will
not be possible for her to follow the rules about the cow. If you enlist
supporters or friends, you can include persons like Rajkumari.
I shall look into the accounts of the old Sangh.

HINDU-MUSLIM PUZZLE
Q.In your proposed solution of the Hindu-Muslim puzzle1, do you expect all
the Hindus to abstain from the legislatures or only a part? If only a part, will not the
most reactionary Hindus get in and make things worse than now? And if you expect
Congressmen to affect the Muslim mind from outside, why can’t you do the same and
perhaps more effectively by being inside?
A.I do not expect all the Hindus to abstain. I know that all
Hindu seats will be filled by non-Congress Hindus. Congress Hindus,
if they go in, will be ground down between the two stones of the
communal chakki2 without doing any good to anybody. I do not
approach the question as a Hindu. I approach it as a Congressman
seeking to represent equally all communities. But for the artificial
system introduced in the composition of the Indian legislatures, all the
members would be representing not communities but their parties
grouped according to their non-communal shibboleths. As one repre-
senting all communities I would expect not only Hindus but Con-
gress-minded Muslims and others too to avoid the legislatures and
elective bodies. These abstainers will hold the scales evenly between all
communities and seek to affect the legislatures from outside. Whether
they are many or only a few, they will play the role of wise men. If all
listened to me, the communal question would disappear from our
midst. By entering the legislatures the Congress Hindus become inter-
lopers, and act weakly for fear of offending one party or the other.
This I know, that at the present moment the legislatures are, and must
become, part of the war machinery. They have no choice. They will
not be allowed to function, if they obstruct the war effort. How could
the rulers whose sole occupation is to prosecute the war do otherwise?
WHY NOT IN HINDU MAJORITY PROVINCES ?
Q.Why not advise Congressmen to withdraw from the provincial legisla-
tures too where the Hindus are in a majority?
A.Because I do not want the non-Muslim minority parties to
act as if they were the majority and carry on the government in these
provinces. It would be a false position to which the Congress would be
1 Vide “Communal Unity”, 20-1-1942.
2 Grinding-stone492 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIa willing party, if the Congress members withdrew. In these provinces,
therefore, abstention cannot solve the communal tangle, and will bring
about an unintended and undesirable state of things.
TORTURING THE LANGUAGE ?
Q.Surely you are torturing the language when you use the world “unitary” in
the place of ‘unilateral’.1 For that is obviously what you mean.
A.I must plead not guilty.‘Unilateral’ has a definite legal
meaning which does not fit in with what I am struggling to convey. It
is not onesidedness. It is no-sidedness. It has impartiality implied in it.
But it is not the method of impartiality. It is something more. I
represent a party, say, the Congress. For the solution of the problem I
apply a method whereby I seek to affect those who are estranged from
me. I am not merely impartial, because I may or may not please them.
Impartiality has to be felt by the aggrieved party. I go the utmost
length to placate the offended party, and trust my out-and-out pure
conduct to affect them. I may not succeed at once. But if there is a
real sense of justice in the method, it must succeed. For want of a
better word I have called the method “unitary”. The dictionary
meaning satisfies my test which I have imperfectly described here.

CONFERENCE  1
February 3, 19422
Did Gandhiji mean to say that even as khadi saved the Indian mill-cloth, the
protection of the cow would mean the protection of the buffalo?
Gandhiji said :
Yes, but I mean something more. I have often said that I should
not shed a single tear, if all the mills were to be destroyed. I would
never say this regarding the buffalo.
Explaining the matter at greater length he said :
No, my point is that, unless we protect the cow today, we will fail
to save both the cow and the buffalo. And it is not possible to make a
combined endeavour to save both. The combined endeavour will
result in the buffalo devouring the cow. The cow is the more neg-
lected animal, and that is why we should concentrate on the cow. But
not even if Jamnalalji got a few crores of rupees can we achieve our
object until we have converted the people to our view—especially the
people who run goshalas and pinjrapoles.
There is no question of ‘boycott’, much less of the killing of
buffaloes. Slaughter is a thing that suggests itself easily to Western
economists. That is why they cut the Gordian knot by slaughtering the
inferior breed of cows and bulls. But that solution is not good for me.
It is my firm conviction that, if we master the real science of saving the
cow, the science of saving the buffalo and other animals would
automatically be revealed to us.
[Q.]But, supposing you were to boycott all the buffaloes in Sevagram, what
would happen to them and their owners?
I promise to take charge of the buffalo in case you succeed in
your mission of the cow to that extent. If the mill-owners voluntarily
1In his article “Goseva Sangh—II”, from which this is reproduced, Mahadev
Desai gives the following introduction : “. . . no one seemed to be clear as regards the
attitude to be adopted regarding the buffalo, and no one seemed to see how, if we saved
the cow, the buffalo would also be saved.”
2 From Bapu-smaran494 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIclose down the mills, I shall dance with joy, but not if the owners of
the buffaloes were to slaughter them. Western economics is divorced
from ethics; our ethics and economics coincide or should, if they do
not. My exclusive emphasis on the protection of the cow is due to the
undue neglect of the cow although she in my opinion is a sound
economic proposition. I do not need the aid of the Vedas to show me
this, and this is a matter in which I would test the Vedic precept on the
anvil of reason. Reason convinces me that if I save the cow I save the
cow and the buffalo both. If anyone can convince me that the cow is
dead beyond redemption, and that the buffalo alone needs to be
protected, I am quite prepared to organize a ‘Buffalo Protection
Association’. But the reverse is the case. The buffalo needs no special
protection, the cow needs it. The buffalo and the goat are as much my
mothers as the cow. But I know that the poor goat cannot be saved,
that the cow badly needs to be saved, and when we have saved the cow
the buffalo will be automatically saved.1
Gandhiji tentatively suggested that co-operative owning of cows and co-
operative owning of pasture for them would go a great length in improving both the
breed and the milk yield and in helping to solve the question of grazing.
For the next year the Goseva Sangh should, suggested Gandhiji, concentrate
on making cow’s milk available throughout Wardha and its neighbourhood, on
sending experts to pinjrapoles in order to collect material, throw out suggestions,
and help in making them approximate to the ideal pinjrapole contemplated by the
Sangh, and on having a laboratory in Wardha for the testing of milk and ghee, and so
on. The Sangh will also try to enlist at least a thousand members.
Harijan, 15-2-1942

that of grazing-areas.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 495749. TO CORRESPONDENTS
Correspondents will please note that I neither open nor read all

should regard the weeklies as my public letter to them. Therefore they
may not as a rule expect personal replies. Many apply for admission
to the Sevagram Ashram. For one thing there is hardly room for
further admissions. Some insist on replies in my own hand. It is not
possible to satisfy this desire, much as I should like to. I would
therefore request all correspondents to spare me and my overworked

The vegetables may include spinach or luni as also turnip, carrots,
cauliflower, radish and tomatoes. They give us the salts, strengthen the
teeth and help digestion. Raw vegetables are four times as valuable as
the same quantity when cooked. They lead to better mastication and

uncooked vegetables from somewhere. The experiment has benefited
me greatly. I have, therefore, advised Ghanshyamdas to make the
same experiment and have him put on four ounces of butter. This has
increased his energy and strength. Please do not, therefore, give up the
experiment. If you keep the leaves immersed in salt water solution,
they will remain fresh. It will be enough if you eat only four or five of
these. But you can eat onions, carrot, knoll-cole, radish, etc., even after
two or more days. You need not take more than two ounces in all. The
rest is all right.
I am writing to Prithvi Singh.
You may send . . .1 over here. I will train him further here and
then let him go. He may then utilize your help. He is indeed a good
man. He is a little immature, but will learn here. You may send for
him if you need him again.
Please take it that the adhesions in your intestines can be cured
only through a carefully selected diet. You should not strain at all
when passing stools.
I understand your eagerness to get Mahadev over there. But he
cannot look after Harijan properly from there. He would naturally
like to show me what he writes and I to see it. After reading what he
writes I often find it necessary to make some essential, though only a
few, changes. I have asked Narahari to go over there.

decision. If you do not get proper notice owing to carelessness, you
will warn those responsible for the confusion. What more can we do?
As for the plates, do this. Collect all the utensils. The new ones
should be withdrawn. So many new utensils have come and still there
is shortage ! What could be the reason?
Collect all the spoons; they should be given to those who need
them.
If you find any difficulty in doing either of these things, take
my help.
The rest later.

[Before February  8, 1942]2
Gandhiji laughingly said :
I will not accept the messages, unless Dr. Carver3 comes and
delivers them himself.
Dr. John said Dr. Carver was too old now to come to India. But he . . .
remembers Gandhiji whenever he has an Indian visitor. . . . The very first question
that Gandhiji asked Dr. John about Dr. Carver was :
But even this genius suffers under the handicap of segregation,
does not he?
Oh yes, as much as any Negro.
And yet these people talk of democracy and equality ! It is an
utter lie.
But Dr. Carver is never bitter or resentful.
I know, that is what we believers in non-violence have to learn
from him. But what about the claim of these people who are said to be
fighting for democracy?

MISBEHAVIOUR OF TROOPS
I have piteous letters from correspondents complaining of
misbehaviour by troops, white and Indian. There are detailed letters
from Dohad and Rutlam stations and others too. The troops are said
to have molested the hawkers on the platforms, helped themselves to
eatables and hit the salesmen who protested. The station-masters were
powerless to afford protection. I do not know how much credit is to
be attached to the descriptions I have received. The evidence is so
detailed and given with so much moderation as to command belief.
Anyway I draw the attention of the authorities to the complaints. Any
such misbehaviour should be put down summarily and repetition
made practically impossible, If panic is to be prevented and bitterness
avoided. I would advise the aggrieved parties to lodge their complaints
to the proper authorities with authentic evidence in support.
HYDERABAD STATE
Swami Ramanand Tirtha of the banned State Congress has
issued the following sober statement2 :
1 Jairamdas Doulatram
2 Of which only extracts are reproduced here502 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHISome of the workers of the Hyderabad State Congress which was
banned on 2nd March, 1940, offered individual satygraha in the month of
September 1940. . . . The Government of H.E.H. the Nizam released them
unconditionally on 16th December, 1941. Immediately after the release, I
issued a statement saying. . . that it was incumbent upon us to continue the
satyagraha till our demend for lifting the ban was conceded by the
Government. After our release we consulted Mahatmaji and. . . he advised us to
abstain from re-offering satyagraha at this hour, and directed us to concentrate
our energies wholly on the constructive programme. . . . We therefore appeal
to the people in general and workers in particular to devote their energies to
this programme. . . . This suspension, however, does not mean any alteration
in our goal which is the attainment of responsible government under the aegis
of H.E.H. the Nizam and the Asafjahi Dynasty.
How I wish the Government of H. E. H. the Nizam would
remove the ban. They cannot wish to prevent people from carrying on
a constitutional movement in favour of responsible government under
the aegis of H. E. H. the Nizam. The recent release of the satyagrahis
loses all grace if the ban on the State Congress is not removed.

             761. NOT NECESSARILY IMPURE
Thus writes Shri Shankerrao Dev:
In the last issue of Harijan, in your article “A Deplorable Incident”1 you
say to the rich: “Earn your crores by all means. But understand that your wealth
is not yours; it belongs to the people. Take what you require for your
legitimate needs, and use the remainder for society.” When I read this, the first
question that arose in my mind was: ‘Why first earn crores and then use them
for society?’ As society today is constituted the means of earning crores are
bound to be impure; and one who earns crores by impure means cannot be
expected to follow the mantra — because in the very process
of earning crores by impure means the man’s character is bound to be tainted
or vitiated. And moreover you have always been emphasizing the purity of
means. But I am afraid that there is a possibility of people misunderstanding
that you are laying an emphasis here more on the ends than on the means.
I request you to emphasize as much, if not more, on the purity of means of
earning money as on spending. If purity of means is strictly observed, then,
according to me, crores could not be accumulated at all and the difficulty of
1 Vide “A Deplorable Incident”, 25-1-1942.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 503spending for society will assume a very minor prospect.
I must demur. Surely a man may conceivable make crores
through strictly pure means, assuming that a man may legitimately
possess riches. For the purpose of my argument, I have assumed that
private possession itself is not held to be impure. If I own a mining
lease and I tumble upon a diamond of rare value, I may suddenly find
myself a millionaire without being held guilty of having used impure
means. This actually happened when Cullinan diamond, much more
valuable than the Kohinoor, was found. Such instances can be easily
multiplied. My argument was surely addressed to such men. I have no
hesitation in endorsing the proposition that generally rich men and
for that matter most men are not particular as to the way they make
money. In the application of the method of non-violence one must
believe in the possibility of every person, however depraved, being
reformed under humane and skilled treatment. We must appeal to the
good in human beings and expect response. Is it not conducive to the
well-being of society that every member uses all his talents, only not
for personal aggrandisement but for the good of all? We do not want
to produce dead equality where every person becomes or is rendered
incapable of using his ability to the utmost possible extent. Such a
society must ultimately perish. I therefore suggest that my advice that
monied men may earn their crores (honestly only, of course) but so as
to dedicate them to the service of all is perfectly sound
— is a mantra based on uncommon knowledge. It is the surest
method to evolve a new order or life of universal benefit in the place
of the present one where each one lives for himself without regard to
what happens to his neighbour.

762. INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE?  1
Shri Jamnalal Bajaj has bravely taken the burden of the great
work of cow service (in other words, cattle preservation) on his
shoulders. The most important question for consideration before the
recent Goseva Sangh Conference2 was whether cow-farming should be
in the hands of individuals or done collectively. I myself had no
hesitaton in saying that she could never be saved by individual
1 The Hindi original of this appeared in Harijan Sevak,  15-2-1942.
2 Held on February 1, 1942504 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfarming. Her salvation, and with her that of the buffalo, could only be
brought about by collective endeavour. It is quite impossible for an
individual farmer to look after the welfare of his cattle in his own
home in a proper and scientific manner. Amongst other causes lack of
collective effort has been a principal cause of the deterioration of the
cow and hence of cattle in general.1
The world today is moving towards the ideal of collective or co-
operative effort in every department of life. Much in this line has been
and is being accomplished. It has come into our country also, but in
such a distorted form that our poor have not been able to reap its
benefits. Pari passu  with the increase in our popultion land-holdings
of the average farmer are daily decreasing. Moreover, what the
individual possesses is often fragmentary.2 For such farmers to keep
cattle in their homes is a suicidal policy; and yet this is their condition
today. Those who give the first place to economics and pay scant
attention to religious, ethical or humanitarian considerations proclaim
from the house-tops that the farmer is being devoured by his cattle
due to the cost of their feed which is out of all proporation to what
they yield. They say it is folly not to slaughter wholesale all useless
animals.
What then should be done by humanitarians is the question. The
answer obviously is to find a way whereby we may not only save the
lives of our cattle but also see that do not become a burden. I am sure
that co-operative effort can help us in a large measure.
The following comparison may be helpful:
1.Under the collective system no farmer can keep cattle in his
house as he does today. They foul the air and dirty the surroundings.
There is neither intelligence nor humanitarianism in living with
animals. Man was not meant to do so. The space taken up by the cattle
today would be spared to the farmer and his family if the collective
system were adopted.
2.As the number of cattle increases, life becomes impossible
for the farmer in his home. Hence he is obliged to sell the calves and
kill the male buffaloes or else turn them out to starve and die. This
inhumanity would be averted, if the care of cattle were undertaken on
1 The Hindi here adds: “This burden is no doubt beyond the strength of an
individual farmer.”
2 The Hindi here adds: “And whatever little he has  only adds to his  pro-
blems.”VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 505a co-operative basis.
3.Collective cattle-farming would ensure the supply of
veterinary treatment to animals when they are ill. No ordinary farmer
can afford this on his own.
4.Similarly one selected bull can be easily kept for the need of
several cows under the collective system. This is impossible otherwise
except for charity.
5.Common grazing ground or land for exercising the animals
will be easily available under the co-operative system, whereas today
generally there is nothing of the kind for individual farmers.
6.The expense on fodder will be comparatively far less under
the collective system.
7.The sale of milk at good prices will be greatly facilitated,
and there will be no need or temptation for the farmer to adulterate it
as he does as an individual.
8.It is impossible to carry out tests of the fitness of every head
of cattle individually, but this could easily be done for the cattle of a
whole village and would thus make it easier to improve the breed.
9.The foregoing advantages should be sufficient argument in
favour of co-operative cattle-farming. The strongest argument in its
favour is that the individualistic system has been the means of making
our own condition as well as that of our cattle pitiable. We can only
save ourselves and them by making this essential change.
I firmly believe too that we shall not derive the full benefits of
agriculture until we take to co-operative farming. Does it not stand to
reason that it is far better for a hundred families in a village to
cultivate their lands collectively and divide the income therefrom than
to divide the land anyhow into a hundred portions? And what applies
to land applies equally to cattle.
It is quite another matter that it may be difficult to convert
people to adopt this way of life straightaway. The straight and narrow
road is always hard to traverse. Every step in the programme of cow-
service is strewn with thorny problems. But only by surmounting
difficulties can we hope to make the path easier. My purpose for the
time being is to show the great superiority of collective cattle farming
over the individual effort. I hold further that the latter is wrong and
the former only is right. In reality even the individual can only
safeguard his independence through co-operation. In cattle-farming
the individual effort has led to selfishness and inhumanity, whereas the506 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcollective effort can abate both the evils, if it does not remove them
altogether.

SEVAGRAM , WARDHA,
February 8, 1942
DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
As I have suspended civil disobedience, I make bold to write this
letter for humanity’s cause.
The statutory law says that charitable institutions, though they
make profits, are free from income-tax. I am the founder and Presi-
dent of the All-India Spinners’ Association. I can give you my word
that it is a purely charitable association. It exists to serve the poorest in
the land through hand-spinning and hand-weaving. But simply
through legal quibbles, disbelief of the evidence tendered and, I
apprehend, for its connection with the Congress in that it got its
charter from the Congress, the officials have decided do levy the
income-tax. The profit are not denied but they have never been used
for private or personal gain. The whole of the Executive of the
Association is honorary. The Association has gone to the High Court
of Bombay which has thrown out its petition on a legal flaw. It is
appealing to the Privy Council. I do not know what will be the result.
Meanwhile the Association has already paid a certain amount of the
tax and is likely to be called upon to pay up to five lacs. They will not
stay the levy pending the proceedings. But my request is for you to
intervene and save the five lacs for the poor. Let me tell you that
during the past 20 years of its existence the Association has distri-VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 507buted among the poor nearly four crores as wages.
I am not burdening you with further facts or any papers. You
can have these for the asking.
You will forgive me for inflicting this on you when every
moment of yours is pre-mortgaged for winning the war. Though I
cannot sympathize with your enterprise, much less help in the manner
you would wish, you will believe me when I say that I am as much
today a friend of your people as I ever have been. Hence I understand
what a strain it must be for you and Lady Linlithgow.
When you write to Lady Anne1 and Southby2 please send my
love to them. I have purposely refrained from acknowledging their
letters in answer to my congratulations. I hope they with the baby are
faring well.
I am,
Yours sincerely,

CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S RESOLUTION1
December 30, 1941
The Working Committee have received the following letter from Gandhiji and
recognize the validity of the point he has raised and therefore relieve him of the
responsibility laid upon him by the Bombay Resolution referred to by Gandhiji. But
the Committee assure him that the policy of non-violence adopted under his guidance
for the attainment of swaraj and which has proved so successful in leading to mass
awakening and otherwise will be adhered to by the Congress. The Working
Committee further assure him that it would like to extend its scope as far as possible
even in free India. The Committee hope that Congressmen will render him full
assistance in the prosecution of his mission, including the offering of civil
disobedience.

CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S RESOLUTION2
December 30, 1941
Fourteen months have elapsed since the Working Committee held their last
meeting and during this period the world has fallen ever deeper into the abyss of war
and rushed headlong towards self-destruction. The members of the Committee have
met again on their release from prison and given earnest thought to all the national
and international developments during this fateful period of human history. The
burden of guiding the Congress and the nation at this critical stage, when old
problems assume a new significance and war approaches the frontiers of India
bringing new problems in its train, is a heavy one which the Committtee can only
shoulder worthily with the full co-operation of the people of India. The Committee
have endeavoured to keep in view the principles and objectives for which the
Congress has stood during these past many years and considered them in the larger
context of world conditions and world freedom. The Committee are convinced that full

2 Vide “Statement to the Press”, 30-12-1941; “Speech at Gujarat Provincial
Congress Committee Meeting”, 4-1-1942; “Speech at A.I.C.C. Meeting”, 15-1-1942
and “Letter to C. Rajagopalachari” 12-1-1942.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 509freedom for the people of India is essential even, and more especially, in the present
state of world turmoil, not only for India’s sake but for the sake of the world. The
Committee also hold that real peace and freedom can only be established and endured
on the basis of world co-operation between free nations.
The Committee gave full expression to their attitude towards the war in their
statement issued on September 14, 1939,1 wherein they condemned Nazi and Fascist
aggression and expressed their willingness to help the cause of freedom and
democracy, provided the objectives of the war were clearly stated and acted upon, in
so far as was possible, in the present. If freedom and democracy were those
objectives, then they must necessarily include the ending of imperialism and the
recognition of the independence of India. Subsequent pronouncements made on behalf
of the British Government and their reactionary and oppressive policy made it clear
that this Government was determined to maintain and intensify its imperialist hold
and exploitation of the Indian people. British policy was one of deliberate insult to
Indian nationalism of a perpetuation of unrestrained authoritarianism and the
encouragement of disruptive and reactionary elements. Not only has every offer made
by the Congress for an honourable compromise been rejected, but public opinion
voiced by organizations regarded as moderate has also been flouted.
The Congress was, therefore, compelled, in order to defend the honour and the
elementary rights of the Indian people and the integrity of the nationalist movement,
to request Gandhiji to guide the Congress in the action that should be taken. Mahatma
Gandhi desirous of avoiding embarrassment to his opponent as far as possible,
especially during the perils and dangers of war, limited the satyagraha movement
which he started to selected individuals who conformed to certain tests he had laid
down. That satyagraha has now proceeded for over fourteen months and about twenty-
five thousand Congressmen have suffered imprisonment, while many thousands of
others who offered satyagraha in the Frontier Province and elsewhere were not
arrested. The committee desire to express their respectful appreciation of Gandhiji’s
leadership and of the response of the nation to it, and are of opinion that this has
strengthened the people.
Throughout this period the attitude of the British Government has been hostile
to Indian freedom and it has functioned in India as a completely authoritarian
government, insulting the deeply cherished convictions and feelings of the people.
Neither the professions of freedom and democracy nor the perils and catastrophes that
have come in the wake of war have affected this attitude and policy, and such changes
as have taken place have been for the worse.
The recent release of a number of political prisoners has no significance or
importance, and the circumstances attending it, and official pronouncements made,
1 Vide, Appendix “Working Committe Manifesto”, 14-9-1939.510 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImake it clear that it is not connected with any change of policy. Large numbers of
detenus, who are kept in prison under the Defence of India Act without trial, and
whose only offence seems to be that they are ardent patriots impatient of foreign rule
and determined to achieve the independence of the country, still remain in prison.
Recent arrests of prominent persons and their treatment in prison also indicate that
the old policy is being pursued as before.
While there has been no change in Britain’s policy towards India, the
Working Committee must nevertheless take into full consideration the new world
situation that has arisen by the development of the war into a world conflict and its
approach to India. The sympathies of the Congress must inevitably lie with the
people who are the subject of aggression and who are fighting for their freedom. But
only a free and independent India can be in a position to undertake the defence of the
country on a national basis and be of help in the furtherance of the larger causes that
are emerging from the storm of war. The whole background in India is one of hostility
and of distrust of the British Government and not even the most far-reaching
promises can alter this background, nor can a subject India offer voluntary or willing
help to an arrogant imperialism which is indistinguishable from Fascist
authoritarianism.
The Committee is, therefore, of opinion that the resolution1 of the A. I. C. C.
passed in Bombay on September 16, 1940, holds today and defines Congress policy
still.

CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S INSTRUCTIONS2
This meeting of the A. I. C. C. endorses the following instructions issued by
the Working Committee and calls upon all Provincial and other subordinate Congress
Committees to give effect to them within their respective areas. The Provincial
Congress Committees are authorized to supplement them wherever necessary. The
Committee expects every member of an elective Congress Committee to devote
himself actively to the execution of some item of this programme, and to send
periodical reports of the work done by him to his Committee :
Recent developments in the world situation have brought war near to India’s
frontiers. This may lead to internal dislocation in certain parts of the country and

2 Vide  “Speech at A.I.C.C. Meeting”, 15-1-1942  and”Question Box”,
19-2-1942.VOL. 81 : 18 AUGUST, 1941 - 8 FEBRUARY, 1942 511there is a possibility of some cities being subjected to aerial attack. Whatever
dangers and difficulties might arise, the real antidote to them is to remain cool and
collected and on no account to give way to nervousness and excitements.
Congressmen must remain at their posts and continue their service of the people;
wherever necessity arises they should yield places of safety to those in greater need
and be ready to render aid to those who may require it.
The Congress can help and serve the people in the difficult times ahead only if
its organization is strong and disciplined and Congressmen individually and
Congress Committees are able to command confidence in their respective localities.
Congress Committees and Congressmen should therefore address themselves
immediately to the task of strengthening the organization and reviving and
maintaining contacts with the people in the villages and towns. Every village
should, as far as possible, receive the message of the Congress and be prepared to face
such difficulties as might arise.
The constructive programme adopted by the Congress, and explained from
time to time by Gandhiji, is of particular importance at this juncture. It is meant not
only to bring about unity among various groups, to remove disabilities which keep
sections of the community backward and depressed, to promote self-reliance and the
co-operative spirit among the people, to increase production and have fairer
distribution but it also furnishes the best opportunity and means of contacts with the
people and service to them which are necessary for winning their confidence. The
Working Committee therefore call upon Congress Committees and workers to further
this programme intensively, and thus exercise a steadying and strengthening
influence in times of dislocation and uneasiness.
During such times there is always a possibility of trouble being created by un-
social elements in the country. To avoid the emergence of such a situation and to meet
it when it arises, volunteers should be organized in both the urban and rural areas.
Such organizations should be formed on the basis of strict non-violence, and it
should always be remembered that the Congress adheres to this principle. These
volunteers may co-operate with other organizations working for other ends, this
volunteer organization is meant for rendering service to the people both normally
and in the event of possible internal commotion. It should therefore avoid conflict
with the authorities.
Prices of commodities have already risen and are causing distress among the
people and no adequate steps have so far been taken by the authorities to meet this
situation. These tendencies are likely to be accentuated in the future, and dislocation512 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIof trade and transport, due to stress of war, may lead to scarcity of the necessaries of
life as well as of many other things which are of everyday use. Big-scale industries in
other countries have suffered heavily on account of the war, and transport of goods
has become difficult on account of military requirements. China has largely overcome
these difficulties by a widespread development of village industries. India may have
to face similar problems, and village and cottage industries afford a solution,
desirable in itself, and more particularly, suited to the needs of the moment. Such
industries can escape to a large extent the effects of dislocation of trade and transport.
It is therefore necessary that this item of the constructive programme should be
widely taken up and worked up with vigour and earnestness so that the countryside
may be rendered, as far as possible, self-sufficient in regard to the necessaries of life.
The Committee would specially recommend to the villagers the growing of food crops
at least to cover the needs of the village and appeal to the grain dealers not to hold up
stores for profit but release them for consumption at fair prices.
In cases of emergency, when instructions are issued to the public by the
authorities for the preservation of life and property and the maintenance of public
order, Congressmen should avoid conflict with the authorities. They should carry out
such instructions, unless they are contrary to Congress directions.

VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 11. TWO REQUESTS1
A friend suggests that I should resume writing my autobio-
graphy2 from the point where I left off and, further, that I should write
a treatise on the science of ahimsa.
I never really wrote an autobiography. What I did write was a
series of articles narrating my experiments with truth which were later
published in book form. More than twenty3 years have elapsed since
then. What I have done or pondered during this interval has not been
recorded in chronological order. I would love to do so but have I the
leisure? I have resumed the publication of Harijan in the present
trying times as a matter of duty. It is with difficulty that I can cope
with this work. How can I find time to bring the remainder of my
experiments with truth up to date? But if it is God’s will that I should
write them, He will surely make my way clear.
To write a treatise on the science of ahimsa is beyond my
powers. I am not built for academic writings. Action is my domain,
and what I understand, according to my lights, to be my duty, and
what comes my way, I do. All my action is actuated by the spirit of
service. Let anyone who can systematize ahimsa into a science do so,
if indeed it lends itself to such treatment. In the event of my inability,
the correspondent has suggested three names in order of preference
for this task: Shri Vinoba, Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala, Shri Kaka
Kalelkar. The first named could do it, but I know he will not. Every
hour of his is scheduled for his work and he would regard it as
sacrilege to take a single moment therefrom for writing a Shastra. I
would agree with him. The world does not hunger for Shastras. What
it craves, and will always crave, is sincere action. He who can appease
this hunger will not occupy his time in elaborating a Shastra.
Shri Kishorelal has already written an independent treatise. If his
health permits, I know he would like to write further. It may not be
correct to call his work a Shastra, but it may be said to be very near to
one. In his present state of health, however, I do not think he can
shoulder the burden, and I would be the last person to lay it on him.
1 Originally written in Gujarati, this appeard as “from Harijanbandhu”
published simultaneously with the source.
2 Vide “An Autobiography”
3 Harijanbandhu has “twenty-five”.2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHILike Shri Vinoba he too does not allow a moment of his time to be
wasted. Much of it is given to help solve the personal problems of
large circle of friends. The end of the day leaves him utterly
exhausted.
Shri Kakasaheb, like Shri Thakkar, is an incorrigible nomad.
Just now he has made the propagation and development of the
national and provincial languages his special concern. Even if he
wanted to divert a moment of his time to the writing of a Shastra, I
would try to prevent him from doing so.
From the above it may be concluded that there is no need at
present for the treatise in question. Any such during my lifetime
would necessarily be incomplete. If at all, it could only be written after
my death. And even so let me give the warning that is would fail to
give a complete exposition of ahimsa. No man has ever been able to
describe God fully. The same holds true of ahimsa. I can give no
guarantee that I will do or believe tomorrow what I do or hold to be
true today. God alone is omniscient. Man in the flesh is essentially
imperfect. He may be described as being made in the image of God,
but he is far from being God. God is invisible, beyond the reach of
the human eye. All that we can do, therefore, is to try to understand
the words and actions of those whom we regard as men of God. Let
them soak into our being and let us endeavour to translate them into
action, but only so far as they appeal to the heart. Could any scientific
treatise do more for us?

6. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
POONA,
February 26, 1946
I congratulate Shrimati Aruna Asaf Ali on her courageous
refutation1 of my statement2 on the happenings in Bombay. Except
for the fact that she represents not only herself but also a fairly large
body of underground workers, I would not have noticed her
refutation, if only because she is a daughter of mine not less so
because not born to me or because she is a rebel. I had the pleasure of
meeting her on several occasions while she was underground. I
admired her bravery, resourcefulness and burning love of the country.
But my admira-  tion stopped there. I did not like her being
underground. I do not appreciate any underground activity. I know
that millions cannot go underground. Millions need not. A select few
may fancy that they  will bring swaraj to the millions by secretly
directing their activity.  Will this not be spoon-feeding? Only open
challenge and open activity is for all to follow. Real swaraj must be felt
by all—man, woman and child. To labour for that consummation is
true revolution. India has beco-me a pattern for all exploited races of
the earth, because India’s has been an open, unarmed effort which
demands sacrifice from all without inflict-ing injury on the usurper.
The millions in India would not have been awakened but for the open,

2 Vide “Statement to the Press”, 23-2-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 5unarmed struggle. Every deviation from the straight path has meant a
temporary arrest of the evolutionary revolution.
I do not read the 1942 events as does the brave lady. It was
good that the people rose spontaneously. It was bad that some or
many resorted to violence. It makes no difference that Shri Kishorelal
Mashruwala, Kakasaheb and other workers, in their impatient zeal for
the movement1 , misinterpreted non-violence. That they did so only
shows how delicate an instrument non-violence is. My analogy is not
meant to cast any reflection on any person. Everyone acted as he or
she thought best. Supineness in the face of overwhelming, organized
violence would have meant cowardice. I would be weak and wrong, if
I failed to give my estimate of the doing of 1942.
Aruna would “rather unite Hindus and Muslims at the barricade
than on the constitution front”. Even in terms of violence, this is a
mis-leading proposition. The union at the barricade is honest, there
must be union also at constitutional front. Fighters do not always live
at the bar-ricade. They are too wise to commit suicide. The barricade
life has always to be followed by the constitutional. That front is not
taboo for ever.
Emphatically it betrays want of foresight to disbelieve British
declarations and precipitate a quarrel in anticipation. Is the official
deputation coming to deceive a great nation? It is neither manly nor
womanly to think so. What would be lost by waiting? Let the official
deputation prove for the last time that British declarations are
unreliable. The nation will gain by trusting. The deceiver loses when
there is correct response for the deceived
Let us force facts. The coming mission is claimed to be a
friendly mission, entertaining the hope that they will discover a
constitutional method of delivery. The problem is knotty, probably
the knottiest that has ever confronted statemen It is possible that the
mission will put forth an insoluble conundrum.So much the worse for
them. If they are intent upon findingan honest way out of the
difficulties of their own creation, I have no doubt, there is a way. But
the nation too has to play the game. If it does, the barricade must be
left aside , at least for the time being. I appeal to Aruna and her
friends to make wise use of the power their bravery and sacrifice has
given them.
1 The source, however, has “moment”.6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIt is a matter of great relief that the ratings have listened to
Sardar Patel’s advice to surrender. They have not surrendered their
honour. So far as I can see, in resorting to mutiny they were badly
advised. If it was for grievance, fancied, or real, they should have
waited for the guidance and intervention of political leaders of their
choice. If they mutinied for the freedom of India, they were doubly
wrong. They could not do so without a 'call from a prepared
revolutionary party. They were thoughtless and ignorant, if they
believed that by their might they would deliver India from foreign
domination.
Aruna is right when she says that the fighters this time showed
grit as never before. But grit becomes foolhardiness when it is
untimely and suicidal as this was.
She is entitled to say that the people “ are not interested in the
ethics of violence or non-violence”, but the people are very much
interested in knowing the way which will bring freedom to the
masses—violence or non-violence. The people have, however imper-
fectly, hitherto gone the way of non-violence. Aruna and her
comrades have to ask themselves every time whether the non-violent
way has, or has not, raised India from her slumber of ages and created
in them a yearning, very vague perhaps, for swaraj. There is, in my
opinion, only one answer.
There are other passages in Shrimati Aruna’s statement which,
as it appears to me, betray confusion of thought. But their treatment
can wait.
Needless to say that I have dealt with the message believing it to
represent her opinion. If it does not, I apologize to her in advance.
My argument, however, is not affected even if it is found that the
reporter has not correctly interpreted her. For my argument is, after
all, impersonal and directed only to the portions which are calculated
to mislead the public, irrespective of their authorship.1

10. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
[On or before February 27, 1946 ]2
I have been asked by several friends to save Gen. Awari’s life by
asking Sardar Patel to revise his decision.3 I have refused, for I have
neither the power nor the wish to do so. The judgment of the
Congress parliamentary Board is, in my opinion, subject to review by
the Working Committee as also the A. I. C. C. Gen. Awari says, he is
not fighting for himself but for the President of the local Board. This
position is altogether wrong. It is regrettable that he should persist in
committing suicide by fasting. But his friends should dissuade him. If
he refuses to listen, I fear, he must be allowed to die without evoking
the slightest sympathy. I say this as the author of satyagraha including
fasts. Neither can be capriciously offered. Public sympathy with
capricious fasting can disrupt society.

BHAI DHARMADEV SHASTRI ,
I read your letter to Bapa. It is good and yet not good. It is
good because it refutes all the allegations against you and not good
because the denial has a touch of resentment and betrays some lack of
vigilance in the matter of duty. You took up the work2 in a spirit of
service and of your own free will, not at anyone else’s instance, nor at
my bidding. My only part in it was that when I was told of it, I
approved of it. Why should you leave it for fear of criticism or even at
my bidding? If it should be given up, it will happen when your own
heart tells you to leave it. I see no such occasion. One who speaks ill
of me should always be a hero for me.3 It is flatterers that we should
flee from. Bapa is looking after all the other things.
Though I have written about the money, I still say that any
service that is good and is rendered honestly and intelligently finds
funds for itself. Why be annoyed with Mirabehn? After all you are
regarded as a respectable man and occasional criticism does affect
you. But why should it bother us? My advice  is that you should go to
Mirabehn, listen to all that she says, tell her all that you wish and

CHI. KISHORELAL ,
Today I am attending to a few letters among which your letter
catches my eye. What you write about Gomati2 is quite
understandable. Some nature cure practitioners can diagnose a casewhich [allopathic] doctors cannot, but this cannot be applied in thecase of Gomati, and I am of the opinion that Dr. Dinshaw cannot copewith the case. He has plenty [to recommend himself]. He is liberal buthas fallen into a track which he is not likely to give up all at once. Heis pulling on with what is not to his liking, thanks to his boundlessfaith in me. I have taken up the burden of running the clinic underthese circumstances . He will guide us wherever we may ask him.
Hence even if Dhirubha i comes, he cannot have the benefit of

2 Addressee’s wifeVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 15Dinshawji’s knowledge, his brilliance and experience. At present he
can utilize my own limited knowledge. Dinshaw himself is physical
culture personified but he does instruct others. He is possessed by
nature cure, by his desire to establish university for it, and he
entertains a hope that it will come to be through his association    with
me. If this department should wholly belong to the poor, we may bid
on it some hope of establishing a university. Under the circumstances,
I don’t think we can give satisfaction to Dhirubhai. I have a feeling
that something like Ashram life might come to be here, as though I
could do nothing else! Or, maybe, I was not interested in anything
else! Thus I am proceeding willingly as well as unwillingly.   I am
sending away from what may be called the menial staff; it  remains to
be seen how far I succeed. Therefore, if Dhirubhai and such others
came, they will have to be content with my own knowledge of nature
cure, such as it is. If, in the mean while, Dinshaw opens up and
acquires the ability of transferring his knowledge to others, we can
make some progress.
Bharatan Kumarappa will not be able to give such work as you
expect. In fact he will be able to write independently. It1 seems to be
very well organized now. Pyarelal and Rajkumari have taken up the
English work. Sushila of course very much wants to be useful but I
don’t take from her much work of this kind. If I did, her medical
work would inevitably suffer. I am relieving Kanu for his primary job.
At present I get much of his work done by Sushila Pai, and she is
doing it well. She has always been in the line. I am taking from her
the work of the Gujarati Department. For Hindustani I have brought
Om Prakash. I trust he will be trained. He certainly wants to be. It is
fairly cold here. I presume you have left Bombay.

Abha1 handed your letter2 only today. I read it. Sailen’s    letter
is also before me. It can be said that nowadays I do not   always stay at
the Ashram. And now it has come to this : that for six months I am at
the Ashram and for six months in Poona and Mahabaleshwar. In such
a situation it will not be proper at all to keep you [at the Ashram] on
my responsibility. I would advise you to have a talk with Chimanlal3
and Krishnachandra. Explain everything to them and, if they agree,
stay at the Ashram. Serve the Ashram and earn your livelihood. Have
a frank talk with Ashadevi4. It will be your responsibility to teach
Bengali. How far mother can mentally adjust herself to the Ashram
remains to be seen; also whether she can bear the heat during summer.
Considering all these, I feel that all of you cannot stay at the Ashram
permanently. Even so I am not giving any decision. Yes, this much I
want to say : When Sailen says that he can decide for himself, a
decision should be taken only about others. Go to Navadweep, stay
there and render as much service as you can, and educate the children
on the lines of Nayee Talim. It would be good to consider this also as
service.

small-scale vege-table cultivation in compounds of bungalows, etc.
This was published in 1942 during war time, in pursuance of a
compaign for growing more food. What was then necessary is much

that the leaflet is printed in English. It may be, however, that only the
English pamphlet has been sent to me, and that it has been translated
into the provincial languages. Be that as it may, the leaflet is certainly
instructive and useful and I would suggest to the readers who are
interested, as they should be, in the matter that they send for and study
it with a view to making use of the suggestions, if they have a plot of
land available for the purpose. Among the hints contained are the
following chosen by me at random :
(a)Plots selected should be well-drained and not overshadowed
by trees or buildings.
(b)Beds in which flowers have been successfully grown are
usually suitable but portions of lawns may also be dug up and used
for vegetable gardening.
(c)Waste water from bath-rooms or kitchen can be utilized for
the purpose.
(d)It stresses the the necessity of using organic manure such as
cowdung, and tells the reader what vegetables can be easily grown.
(e)A table is given at the end showing the quantity of particular
seeds required, the depth at which they should be sown, the size of the
beds and the distance between the rows of plants.
HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS1
A correspondent writes :
You are at present in Poona. I understand from the papers
that H. H. the Aga Khan is your friend. He has plenty of land
and water supply at his disposal in his palace in Poona. The
same applies to the spacious grounds of Government House at
Ganeshkhind. Could not both these places be utilized for
growing food? Could you suggest it to him?
You believe in fasts. You have said that fasts are not merely
for attaining religious merit but are also beneficial for health.
Cannot you then recommend to the well-fed abstention from
food either one day or for even one meal or more during the
week? A great deal of foodstuffs could thus be made available
to the poor.
They say that even small quantity of sprouted grain, if eaten
1 Orginally written in Hindi, this appeared as “from Harijan Sevak ” pubished
simultaneously with the source.18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIraw, provides the requisits nourishment. Is this so?
The above is condensed from a letter. All the three suggestions
are sound and could easily be put into practice. The first is obviously
for those who possess both land and water; the second for the well-to-
do; the third applies to all. In essence it means that whatever can be
eaten raw would be so eaten. By intelligently following this rule, one
can make a small quantity go a long way.1 Not only that, it is also
beneficial. I have little doubt that if people understood the laws of
dietetics and acted accordingly, a tremendous economy in food could
be effected.
UTILIZATION OF AVAILABLE POWER2
Q.Flour grinding machines are turned by engines in
thousands of villages in Gujarat. By removing them to    the
source, these engines could easily be used for drawing water
from rivers, tanks and wells for purposes of irrigation. Could not
the Government be induced or the owners be persuaded to
divert the engines for this useful work in addtion to working the
grinders?
A.I regard the existence of power wheels for the grinding of
corn in thousands of villages as the limit of our helplessness. I
suppose India does not produce all the engines or grinding machines.
I fondly hope that the correspondent is incorrect and that the number
of wheels and engines does not run into thousands even for the whole
of India,3 and certainly not in the villages of Gujarat. But if true, it is
indicative of the utter laziness into which our people have fallen. The
planting of such machinery and engines on a larger scale in villages is
also a sign of greed. Is it proper to fill one’s pockets in this manner at
the expense of the poor? Every such machinery puts thousands of
hand chakkis4 out of work and takes away employment from thou-
sands of housewives and artisans who make these chakkis. Moreover
the process is infective and will spread to every village industry. The
decay of the latter spells too the decay of art. If it meant replacement
of old crafts by new ones, one might not have much to say against it.
But this is not what is happening. In the thousands of villages where
power machinery exists, one misses the sweet music in the early

But to come to the main point : Whilst I hold that these power
engines are at present being put to wrong use, it would be some
compensation if the engines, in addition to their present use, were also
used to pump water out of rivers, tanks and wells for irrigation. My
correspondent suggests Government aid for this. Must this be
necessary? Will not the owners of their own free will turn their engines
towards this useful and necessary work? Or have we been reduced to
such a paralytic state that without Government compulsion we are
unprepared to do anything? Be that as it may, it is my firm opinion
that all necessary measures should be taken at once to utilize existing
power in order to save the people from the terrible fate confronting
them.

25. WHOSE NEED?1
The institution of domestic servants is an old one. But the
attitude of master towards servant has changed from time to time.
Some  regard servants as members of the family whereas others look
upon them as slaves or chattels. Between these two extreme views may
be summed up the attitude of society in general towards servants.
Nowadays servants are in great demand everywhere. They have
become conscious  of their value and naturally demand their own
conditions of pay and service. This would be proper, if it were
invariably coupled with a proper understanding and performance of
their duty. In that event  they would cease to be servants and would
earn for themselves the  status of members of the family. The belief in
the efficacy of violence is, however, in the air. How then can servants
properly win the status of members of their masters’ families? That is
a question that may well be asked.
I hold that a man who desires the co-operation of, and wishes to
co-operate with, others should not be dependent on servants. If
anyone has to have one at a time of scarcity of servants, he will have to
pay what is demanded and accept all other conditions with the result
that he will, instead of being master, become the servant of his
1 Orginally written in Gujarati, this appeared as “from Harijanbandhu ”
published simultaneously with the source.20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIemployee. This is good for neither the master nor the so-called1
servant. It has only one thought, that of pursuing his self-interest. But
if what an individual seeks is not slavery but the co-operation of a
fellow-being, he will not only serve himself but also him whose co-
operation he needs. Through the extension of this principle, a man’s
family will become coterminous with the world and his attitude
towards his fellow-beings will also undergo a corresponding change.
There is no other way of reaching the desired consummation.
He who wants to act on this principle will be content to start
with small beginning. In spite of a man’s ability to command the co-
operation of thousands, he must have sufficient self-restraint and self-
respect in him to enable him to stand alone. Such a person will never
dream of looking on any person as his menial and try to keep him
under subjugation. In fact he will forget altogether that he is master of
his servants and will try his best to bring them to his level. In other
words he should be content to do without what others cannot have.

My brethren-farmers from Bardoli are unhappy because my

can understand their disappointment. I am also pained that I could
not go to Bardoli. Although I am short of time, I had made all
preparations for going to Bardoli. I had also written to those who
wanted to see me. But after the riot which broke out in Bombay I
changed my plan. I wrote1 to the Sardar that he should be in Bombay
for the present. He liked the suggestion, and the programme for
Bardoli was cancelled.
I hope, all will forget their disappointment when they know
these facts. I take it that I will have to go to Bardoli on some other
occasion.

[Before March 3, 1946 ]
Look at Italy. Garibaldi2 was a great man. He brought
deliverance to Italy. And Mussolini3 did make her look great. But
where is she today? Look at Japan, look at Germany. The very
violence which brought them to the pinnacle of power has razed them
to the ground. And has not the atom bomb proved the futility of all
violence? And yet we are crazy enough to think that we can win swaraj
by breaking a few skulls and destroying property which, after all is
said and done, is our own. I am sure, out of this orgy of violence, the
people will learn the lesson of non-violence.

38. EXTRACT FROM TALK WITH A SOLDIER4
[Before March 3, 1946 ]5
No. But, as you know, I stand for unadulterated non-violent
action and open means. I abhor secrecy. . . . I laid down a
programme of non-violent action in my 7th of August, 1942   
speech6 in the A. I. C. C. for evoking7 and organizing the highest non-
violence and self-sacrifice that the country was capable of. I told in
that speech what the Press should do, what the students should do,

been to Gandhiji’s camp during the week to seek advice.  One of them . . . was deeply
agitated.  The men were getting desperate, he said.  Would Gandhiji ask them to lie
low and swallow all the humiliations and injustice?”

and lastly what the Indian soldiers  should do. If all of them had done
their part as suggested by me, it would have had a staggering effect.
That programme can still be acted upon. The soldiers should declare
that they will do soldiering not for their bellies but to make India free
and to keep her free. I do not want them to be disloyal to the
Government in whose pay they are, for, if they are disloyal to the
present Government today, by the same token they may be disloyal to
the national Government tomorrow. But it is no disloyalty for a
soldier to go and tell his superiors that he will be their man only so
long as they stand for his country’s freedom and that he would never
bear arms to crush the liberty of his own people. If, as a result of their
declaration, they were disbanded, cashiered or even court-martialled,
they should not mind. Thereby they would light a spark which not all
the armaments at the disposal of any power would be able to put out
and before long the entire Indian army would be filled with the spirit
of patriotism without having to shed blood. If, on the contrary, they
resorted to indiscipline and violence or rowdyism, they would alienate
all sympathy and provide the authorities an excuse to teach them a
lesson.1
Harijan, 10-3-1946
39. CONFLICT OF IDEAS
She was unable to understand Gandhiji calling upon R. I. N. ratings to
resign, if their condition was humiliating.2 If they did that, they would have to
give up their only means of livelihood. Moreover, they were fighting for
principles. If they resigned now, there would be hundreds in these days of
unemployment to take their places who would be subject to the same
discrimination and treatment and the R. I. N. ratings would not have achieved
anything. It simply does not lie in the mouth of Congressmen who are
themselves going to the legislatures to ask the ratings to give up their jobs. It
does not help the cause of the country at all.
Every one of the statements quoted above from Arunabehn’s
Press interview is contrary to the views generally held by or  attributed
1 Pyarelal concludes the talk with the following reply from the visitor:        
“My brain was muddled, when I came here.  I now see things more clearly.                 
You have saved us from a big mistake.  We shall take no precipitate or thoughtless
step.”
2 Vide “Letter to Balvantsinha”, 25-2-194628 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIto Congressmen. Whather she really holds or does  not hold, the views
put into her mouth is irrelevant here. For the moment it is enough to
examine them on their merits and to show that they are wholly
inconsistent with Congress resolutions.
The first principle of non-violent action as propounded in the
Congress resolution1 of 1920 at its special session in Calcutta under
the late Lal Lajpatrai is that of non-co-operation with everything
humiliating. It must be remembered that the R.I.N. was founded not
for the benefit of the ruled. The men went with their eyes open.
Discrimination stares one in the face. It cannot be avoided, if one
enters the service which is frankly organized to keep India under
subjection. One may, one ought to, try to mend the conditions. That is
possible only up to a point. That cannot be achieved through mutiny.
Mutiny may conceivably succeed but the success can only avail the
mutineers and their kin, not the whole of India. And the lesson would
be a bad inheritance. Discipline will be at least as necessary under
swaraj as it is now. India under successful mutineers would be cut up
into warring factions exhausted by internecine strife.
India of the Congress has made little headway in the
appreciation of the fight for swaraj, if it is true that hundreds would
take their places if the present ratings resigned in pursuance of their
campaign against humiliation. Can we have swaraj for the masses, if
we are so degraded that hundreds of us are ready to swallow
humiliation even to the extent of taking the place of humiliated
fellowmen? The very thought is unworthy of Congressmen and that
too at the moment when swaraj is believed to be within sight.
Those who hold that enlistment in the R.I.N. is their only means
of livelihood must have a very poor opinion of them. A soldier’s is a
hard life. He is disciplined to work in co-operation and trained to
wrok with the pickaxe and the spade. Such a one will disdain to think
that apart from soldiering he has no means of livelihood. We have a
poor opinion of soliders, if we think that they cannot earn their bread
by the sweat of the brow. A labourer is any day worthy of his hire.
What is, however, true is that a soldier out of his calling will lack the
glamour and the amenities provided for him. We have wasted precious
twenty-five years, if we have not yet stripped the profession of killing
and destroying the thick coat of varnish that has covered it for so
long.
1 Vide “Congress Resolution on Non-Co-Operation”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 29Aruna Asaf Ali had been reported to have said that the ratings
would have gained nothing by resigning. Well, they would have
gained honour and dignity, if they had manfully given up their job,
and taught the citizens of Bombay the way to save honour and
dignity, and they could have spared Bombay the senseless destruction
of life, property and very precious food-stuffs. Surely this would have
been an achievement not quite beneath notice.
The last statement in the reported interview is surely a confusion
of thought. Congressmen going to the legislatures for conserving the
honour and liberty of the country is not the same as ratings serving
for their livelihood with the possibility of being used against their own
countrymen and their liberty. Congressmen who go to the legislatures
are representatives elected by their voters and they go even if it is only
to prevent those from going who will misrepresent the voters. Going
to the legislatures may be altogether bad, but there can be no such
comparison as has been just adverted to.

40. WHAT, AFTER FINISHING STUDIES ?1
A student has seriously posed this question :
What am I to do after finishing my studies ?
We are today a subject race and our educational system has been
devised to serve the interest of our rulers. But even as the most selfish
person is obliged to hold out some lure to those whom he is out to
exploit, so a number of temptations for studying in their institutions
have been brought into being by the rulers. Moreover all members of
Gvoernment are not alike. There are some liberal-minded among
them who will consider the problem of education on merits. Therefore
there is no doubt some good even in the present ;system. But the
prevailing education is willy-nilly put to wrong use, i.e., it is looked
upon as a means of earning money and position. It lends charm to
slavery.2
The ancient aphorism, ‘Education is that which liberates’ is         
as true today as it was before. Education here does not mean          
mere spiritual knowledge nor does liberation signify only spiritual
1 Originally written in Gujarati, this appeared as “from Harijiabandhu ”
published simultaneously with the source.
2 This sentence is translated from the Gujarati version.30 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIliberation after death. Knowledge includes all training that is useful
for the service of mankind, and liberation means freedom from all
manner of servitude even in the present life. Servitude is of two kind :
slavery to domination from outside and to one’s own artificial needs.
The knowledge acquired in the pursuit of this ideal alone constitutes
true study. Having had such study, one will not be confronted with the
question : ‘What, after finnishing studies ?1”.
Realizing that a form of education devised by foreign rulers
could only be calculated to subserve their interests, the Congress
accepted, in 1920, among other things, the principle of the boycott of
all Governmental educational institutions. But that era seems to be
over. The demand for entrance to Government institutions and those
imparting education on similar line is increasing faster than the
number of such schools and colleges. The ranks of examinees are
ever swelling. In spite of this hypnotic spell, however, I hold that true
education is what I have defined.
A student who is superficially attracted by the educational ideal
set forth by me and leaves his studies is liable to repent of his action
later. I have, therefore, suggested a safer course. While continuing his
studies in the institution which he has joined, he should ever keep
before him the ideal of service set forth by me and use his studies with
a view to serve that ideal, never for making money. Moreover he
should try to make up the lack in the present education by application
of his leisure hours to the ideal. He will, therefore, avail himself to the
utmost of whatever opportunity offers for taking part in the
constructive programme.

Do send for Kanchan2 and go to Vyara. Write to me after you
have settled everything. If you are ready, keeping you with me might
perhaps be the best way of using your services. Whatever your
decision, if you communicate it to me at an early date, it will help me.
But come to no decision before meeting Kanchan. Do not take any
hasty step. Draw Hiramani’s fare as you have suggested and debit the
sum to the Ashram account. Yours can be accepted here, but perhaps
it would be better to debit that, too, to the Ashram account.
If you have still any more questions to ask, you may ask again.

CHI. DINSHAW,
I was upset in the morning. I felt as though I had erred or
commited a blunder. Can we afford to hire such an expensive and
well-appointed premises5 for the poor ? By doing so am I not abusing
the people’s trust in me ? I want to serve the poor in my own way. I
have a feeling, it will not need any of the paraphernelia you have
arranged. My place is only in some village where I can start with a few
huts and render service. Such thoughts pass through my mind and I
cannot take a decision. Please do not [bother go] reply to this. Speak
to me tomorrow. Ponder over it. The board of trustees ought to
confer, if only to clear this confusion. I have, therefore, written to
Jehangirji a letter, a copy of which I am enclosing. Please read it and
think over it. I believe we ought not to persist, if we have made a
mistake. Of course there is no reason to be alarmed; it is for us to find
a way.

MY  DEAR  MR.  ABELL,
I have been commissioned by Gandhiji to write and ask you whether it is
possible to increase the quota of newsprint for Harijan.  A good deal of matter is felt
over every week in spite of the fact that the paper contains no advertisements and
nothing but substanital reading matter.  The demand from the public is immense.  If
you feel that Harijan is a need of the State as much as of the public, will you see if it
can get extra quota of paper, whether for extra reading matter or for a larger number of
copies to cope with the demand.
The Manager has made the usual application, but you know the way of                         
red tape. 
The present Harijan contains 16 columns only.  The old often used to

I must write this in what has become as good as your mother

when you wanted top lines, I gave you them.  I have developed a
dislike for writing to an Indian in any but the national language.  So I
write to Sastriar and Bidhan2 in Hindustani.
So much for the preface.
Why do you worry about events?  Do your duty, never think of
results :
Let things take their course.  It is enough, you and I have acted
right.
Of course I was bound to write about you what I felt.4 I would
never have excused myself, if, when challenged, I had kept silent.  It
gave us all an insight into man’s thoughtlessness. You must, therefore,
cheer up and get well quickly.  Tell me when you are coming.

situation”.  Writing again on March 22, Abell informed Amrit Kaur of the decision

POONA,
[On or after March 5, 1946 ]2
I have seen Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s message, and I have
nothing to add to what he has said.
The Hindu , 8-3-1946
55.  MY  CONFESSION  AND  CURE3
It is plain to me as it has become to some of my friends that I
am incorrigible.  I can learn only by my mistakes.4 I do not know why
I could not learn through objections or warnings from others.5 I can
learn only when I stumble and fall and feel the pain.  As children we
all used to learn this way.  My condition is just like a child’s even in
my 76th year.  I have just discovered myself making a mistake which
I should never have made.
1 The report said that “this was in reply to a cable asking for a message to the
foreign Press”.  Gandhiji was requested to give a statement on the recent events in
India and on the proposed visit of the British Cabinet Mission—Sir Pethick-
Lawrence, Sir Stafford Cripps and A. V. Alexander—which reached India on March 24
to discuss with Indian leaders the framing of India’s Constitution.
2 From the reference to Vallabhbhai Patel’s message, given in response to a
similar request made in Bombay, which was published on March 5; vide “Vallabhbhai
Patel’s Message to Foreign Press”, 4-3-1946
3 A Gujarati version of this appeared in Harijanbandhu published simultane-
ously with the source.
4 The Gujarati version has : “I can learn only by making mistakes and then
acknowledging and correcting them.”
5 This and the following three sentences are translated from the Gujarati.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 39I have known Dr. Dinshaw Mehta for a long time.  He has
dedicated his life solely to nature cure of his conception.  His one
ambition is to see a full-fledged nature cure university established                  
in India. A university worth the name must be predominantly                    
for the prevention and cure of the diseases of the poor villagers of                  
India.  No such university exists in the world.  The institutes in the
West are designed more for the rich than for the poor.
I feel that I know the method of nature cure for the villagers of
India.  Therefore I should at once have known that nature cure for the
villagers could not be attempted in Poona city.  But a Trust was made.
Very sober Jehangirji Patel permitted himself to be a co-trustee with
Dr. Mehta and me, and I hastened to Poona to run for the poor Dr.
Mehta’s erstwhile Clinic which was designed for the rich.  I suggested
some drastic changes; but last Monday1 the knowledge dawned upon
me that I was a fool to think that I could ever hope to make an
institute for the poor in town.  I realized that if I cared for the ailing
poor, I must go to them and not expect them to come to me.  This is
true of ordinary medicinal treatment.  It is much more so of nature
cure.  How is a villager coming to Poona to understand and carry out
my instructions to apply mud-poulties, take sun cure, hip and friction
sitz-baths or certain foods cooked conservatively?2 Will it not be
impudence?  The villager would go away nodding, but at the same
time he would smile and think that the person who advised him to
undergo nature cure was a fool.  He would expect me to give him a
powder or a potion to swallow and be done with it.  Nature cure
connotes a way of life which has to be learnt; it is not a drug cure as
we understand it.  The  treatment to be efficatious  can, therefore, only
take place in or near a man’s cottage or house.  It demands from its
physician sympathy and patience and knowledge of human nature.
When he has successfully practised in this manner in a village, or
villages, when enough men and women have understood the secret of
nature cure, a nucleus for a nature cure university is founded.  It
should not have required eleven days’ special stay in the institute to
discover and all its attendant paraphernalia for my purpose.  I do not
know whether to laugh or weep over my folly.  I laughed at it and        
made haste to undo the blunder.  This confession completes the

2 The following two sentences are translated from the Gaujarati.40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIreparation.1 I have not learnt to give up any work once begun and
therefore there is only one alternative left for me.  In which village
should I start this work?
I should like the reader to draw the moral that he should          
never take anything for gospel truth even if it comes from a       
Mahatma unless it appeals to both his head and heart.  In the present
case my folly is so patent that even if it had continued for some time,
very few, if any, would have succumbed to it.  The real villagers would
not have come for relief to this institute. But if the discovery had
come too late, it would have blasted my reputation for I would have
lost in my own estimation.  Nothing hurts a man more than the loss of
self-respect.  I do not know that now I deserve the confidence of my
fellowmen.  If I lost it, I know that I shall have deserved the loss.  To
complete the story I must tell the reader that not a piece of the money
earmarked for the poor ailing villagers has been spent on this abortive
enterprise.  What shape the present institution will now take and where
and how poor man’s nature cure will be tried is no part of this
confession.  The result of the initial mistake must not, however, be an
abandonment of the new pursuit that I have taken up in the so-called
evening of my life.  It must, on the contrary, be a clearer and more
vigorous pursuit of the ideal of nature cure for the millions, if such a
thing is at all practicable.  Possible it certainly is.2 So far as I am
concerned it is enough if this mistake makes me more cautious in
realizing my ideals.  Time alone can say whether or not poor villagers
would welcome nature cure.  There is no reason to doubt that it
should be welcome.

Q.How can a person in the military do constructive work?  
A.A military man who has any grit in him can take up  
spinning together with the anterior and posterior processes. He         
can go in for paper making or any other village craft during his     
leisure hours.  Army men have plenty of leisure when they are not

engaged in it though they have to stand by ready. Thus they can learn
all those activities which are being conducted for the freedom of
India. They should learn the national language in the two scripts.  All
this study must be coupled with a burning love of freedom and the
courage to stand true to one’s conviction and to act accordingly even
if one is left alone.  In no way does this conflict with military
discipline.  I do not believe in indulging in indiscipline especially in
military service. Nor is there any room in my scheme of things for
secret activity. Adherence to these principles is the only correct course
for an individual or a people.
Q.It is supposed to be a sign of ill-breeding not to leave some
food on one’s plate after finishing a meal.  The contrary is supposed
to be the correct thing to do.2 Why is it so?  And can it be tolerated
when people are starved?
A.It passes my comprehension how such action can be
tolerated, especially in the face of the threatened famine.  I do not
know the reason for this practice, and it would be waste of time to
enquire into it.  I consider it to be a sign of vulgarity and lack of
perspective to have more on one’s plate than one requires.  In the
present time no one is really entitled to full meals.  Waste would be
sign of callousness.  On the other hand, I consider it good breeding
and discrimination to leave one’s plate clean of leavings.  It saves too
the time of those who wash up.  It is thoughtful and correct before
beginning a meal to remove what one con-siders excess from one’s
plate on to a clean plate.  Hosts should be discri-minating and have
enough delicate regard to find out what their guests require in way of
food and then give them no more than what they want.
Q.Writing letters in blood and using blood for auspicious
marks is becoming almost a fashion.  Ought it not to be stopped?
A.To my mind this is a revolting practice.  It causes no hurt to
take a little blood from oneself.  In these days, in particular, blood
letting can be performed without the slightest pain or inconvenience.
If too much is taken from him, the donor experiences weakness.  But
to write or sign letters in one’s own blood is neither bravery nor does
it connote any sacrifice or suffering.  It is nothing more or less than
criminal folly and ought to be abjured.  Not only that, it is duty to

57.  SATYAGRAHA  IN  FACE  OF  HOOLIGANISM1
A friend has gently posed the question as to what a satyagrahi
should do to prevent looting by goondas2.  If he had understood the
secret of satyagraha, he would not have put it.
To lay down one’s life, even alone, for what one considers to be
right, is the very core of satyagraha.  More no man can do.  If a man
is armed with a sword, he might lop off a few heads but ultimately he
must surrender to superior force or else die fighting.  The sword of
the satyagrahi is love and the unshakable firmness that comes from it.
He will regard as brothers the hundreds of goondas that confront him
and instead of trying to kill them he will choose to die at their hands
and thereby live.
This is straight and simple.  But how can a solitary satyagrahi
succeed in the midst of a huge population?  Hundreds of hooligans      
were let loose on the city of Bombay for arson and loot.  A solitary
satyagrahi will be like a drop in the ocean. Thus argues the corresp-
ondent.
My reply is that a satyagrahi may never run away from danger,
irrespective of whether he is alone or in the company of many.  He
will have fully performed his duty, if he dies fighting. The same holds
good in armed warfare.  It applies with greater force in satyagraha.
Moreover the sacrifice of one will evoke the sacrifice of many and
may possibly produce big results.  There is always this possibility.
But one must scrupulously avoid the temptation of a desire for
results.3 Here    I am indicating only a possibility.  May no one regard
results as    a temptation.
I believe that every man and woman should learn the art of      
self-defence in this age [and in all ages]4.  This is done through arms

3 The rest of the paragrpah is translated from the Gujarati version.
4 From the GujaratiVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 43in the West. Every adult man is conscripted for army training             
for a definite period. The training for satyagraha is meant for all,
irrespective of age or sex. The more important part of the train-          
ing here is mental, not physical. There can be no compulsion            
in mental training.  The surrounding atmosphere no doubt acts on the
mind but that cannot justify compulsion.
It follows that shopkeepers, traders, mill-hands, labourers,
farmers, clerks, in short everyone ought to consider it his or her duty
to get the necessary training in satyagraha.
Satyagraha is always superior to armed resistance. This can only
be effectively proved by demonstration, not by argument. It is the
weapon that adorns the strong.  It can never adorn the weak. By weak
is meant the weak in mind and spirit, not in body.  That limitation is a
quality to be prized and not a defect to be deplored.
One ought also to understand one of its other limitations.  It can
never be used to defend a wrong cause.
Satyagraha brigades can be organized in every village and in
every block of buildings in the cities. Each brigade should be comp-
osed of those persons who are well-known to the organizers.  In this
respect satyagraha differs from armed defence.  For the latter the State
impresses the service of everybody.  For a satyagraha brigade only
those are eligible who believe in ahimsa and satya.  Therefore an
intimate knowledge of the persons enlisted is necessary for the
organizers.

58.  PERSECUTION  OF  HARIJANS1
Sir Parikshitlal Majmudar2 writes :
There was high mortality due to some epidemic in a village in Wadhwan
State, Kathiawar.  The superstition of the villagers ascribed this misfortune to
Harijans and they began to intimidate the Bhangi families.  The latter fled
from the village through fright.  Harijan workers . . . approached the State
authorities to take immediate steps to protect the Bhangis. . . .  The State acted

2 Secretary, Gujarat branch of Harijan Sevak Sangh; only an extract from his
letter is reproduced here.44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIpromptly and the families returned. . . .
The only remedy for this kind of superstition is the spread of
correct knowledge. The reason for its existence in Kathiawar           
seems to be that the reform movement has not yet touched the     
villages there. Workers must make Herculean efforts to remedy this
de-fect. But wherefrom are such workers to come? Even those already
working in Kathiawar fight shy of going to the villages. And, even if
they go, one can well imagine the immense difficulty of the task
confronting them.  Man’s endeavour at its highest consists in contin-
uing to perform one’s duty undeterrred by difficulties.The Kathiawar
incident must be taken to heart. Both the State and the people
understood their duty and took prompt and firm measures in the
instance quoted and the difficulty was surmounted for the time being.
If this example were to be widely followed, it would cut at the very
root of superstition. And that would be true education.

Hindu and Mussalman tea is sold at railway stations.  Separate
arrangements for meals for the two communities are sometimes made
and none seems to be there for Harijans.  All this is a sign of our
pitiable condition and constitutes a blot on British administration.
One can understand their not interfering in religious matters, but for
them to allow separate arrangements for tea, water, etc., for the two
communities is to set the seal of approval on separatism.  Railways and
railway travelling offer a golden opportunity which could be used for
social reform and for educating the public in sanitation and hygiene,
good manners and communal unity. Instead, however, an utter neglect
of and indifference to these desiderata are shown. Railway travel
serves to strengthen, rather than mitigate, evil customs and bad habits.
First and second-class passengers are pampered, luxurious habits
encouraged. Third-class passengers on whom the railway revenues
largely depend are denied even elementary amenities and exposed to
all kinds of hardship.  In either case weakness is exploited.  And when,
in addition to this, separatism and un-touchability are recognized by
the railway authorities, it is the very limit.  If any passenger wishes to
impose restrictions on himself, he is at liberty to do so at his own
expense and suffer, maybe, even hunger and thirst.  But let him not
demand special facilities for himself from railway authorities.
That vegetarians and non-vegetarians should be catered for, is
another matter.  That is already being done.

CHI.  BHANSALI,
Would it not be wholly improper, if you had undertaken the
three days’ fast because you are angry with either Pushpa or Kamala?
Such a fast can never have a place in our ethics.  And, if you had
undertaken it with calm deliberation, shouldn’t you have my
1 Originally written in Hindi, this appeared as “from Harijan Sevak ” published
simultaneously with the source.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 47permission for it?  Don’t you remember my having suggested that no
one was to undertake a fast without my permission?  If you don’t,
henceforth please bear it in mind.  Now that it is over, let us not bother
about it.  Surely you are not going to undertake any more [fasts]; so
let bygones be bygones.  This letter is for the future.
From a man like you I expect the perfection of human qualities.
It would be wrong, if Pushpa or Kamala or any other worker, man or
woman, was careless while working for you or for anyone else.  The
remedy, however, is that the person should be patiently taught to be
more careful.
We should do without the services of persons who are careless
about their duties. Such persons would then gradually become
careful.

Kanam writes and says that you have again fallen ill. You did

POONA,
March 7, 1946
CHI.  KRISHNACHANDRA,
I did write a few letters to you.  And whenever I dictate letters or
ask someone to write to you, these too should be looked upon as
letters from me.  A number of letters have now gone from here.  It
cannot be said that anything remains to be answered.
I do not consider Bhansalibhai’s fast to be right, and nobody in
the Ashram has any right to undertake a fast like this.  I have always
said that if one wanted to undetake a fast, one must take my
permission.  The rule still applies.  It may be asked, what is to be done
when I am away. The answer is that the Manager of the Ashram
should be consulted and, if he is in doubt, then some senior member
like Vinobaji or Kishorelalbhai and others should be consulted.  If
there is time to consult me, then it is, of course, better to do so.
Observance of this rule would save one from any possible conflict of
duties.
I think you should now give up your insistence on buying an
ox.  We may not be able to become the poorest among the poor, but
let us try to be like the poor in every way we can.  Crores of people
cannot afford an ox, and there are very few people in India who have
good oxen.  Why should we not try to be like them?  It would be a
sign of perverted reason to cite the instance of the Goseva Sangh in
this connection.  Let us see how much we can achieve with mere
manual labour without oxen and without Western machinery.  You
will see that a great deal can be done in this way.

POONA,
March 7, 1946
Letters and wires continue to come to me seeking my aid in
saving Gen.  Awari’s life which seems now to be sinking.  I know
Gen. Awari.  He is a lovable worker.  But I know too that he is oftenVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 49improperly obstinate.  The present occasion is a case in point.1 If a
man, however popular and great he may be, takes up an improper
cause and fasts in defence of the impropriety, if is the duty of his
friends (among whom I count myself), fellow-workers and relatives to
let him die rather than that an improper cause should triumph so that
he may live.  Fairest means cease to be fair when the end sought is
unfair. Let me say once more where Gen. Awari’s end is improper                
and unfair.  He may be wholly right in his statement that a great    
wrong has been perpetrated by the Central Parliamentary Board of the
Congress. But who can right the wrong?  Not Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
as Gen. Awari tells me he can.  He is but an individual Sardar2 thought
he has pronounced the decision of the Board.  A judge cannot review
his own judgment.  The Sardar is out of the picture.  The Central
Board cannot, must not, review its own judgment.  It has no authority.
No institution can act capriciously in a well-managed democracy.
Gen. Awari and his friends have the right of appeal or review by the
Working Committee, then the A. I. C. C.; finally the Congress.  This
procedure may appear to him too long.  It is not, unless he is fighting
for an individual or individuals and not for a principle, as he assures
me, he is doing. Time always runs in favour of the defence of a
principle.  If the general session of the Congress which is the highest
tribunal for vindicating justice decides against Gen. Awari, he has to
submit to its verdict.  The Congress is the panchayat.  Like the king it
can do no wrong. This is merely a necessary and legitimate concep-
tion for guidance in the observance of an infallible duty.  In truth,
however, decisions of human organizations in all climes have been
sometimes found to be wrong. So it may be in the case under
discussion.  Then, but not till then, will Gen. Awari have in theory the
right, if he chooses to exercise it, to stir public conscience into action
by a fast to the finish.  In practice, it will be ludicrous.  For the
principle behind such action can only euphemistically be so-called.
In democracy even pure men may unconsciously give wrong
decisions. The remedy is more and purer education, greater
awakening of the public and, in such quickened atmosphere, the rise
of a number of public workers whose sole duty will be to speak, write
and act so as to serve as bright examples for the public.

2 Literaly, ‘chief’50 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHINow I hope the friends of Gen. Awari will understand me when
I say that those who wrongly support him and his fast and thus
encourage him will hasten Gen. Awari’s death, not those who will not
swerve from well-recognized canons of justice even for the sake of
saving the life of an erring friend.  Let justice triumph though the
heavens weep.

67.  SPEECH  AT  MEETING  OF  TRUSTEES  OF  ALL-INDIA
NATURE  CURE  FOUNDATION, POONA1
March 7, 1946
Mahatma Gandhi explained that nature cure therapeutics as practised in the
cities of India and in the West was not suitable for the masses in the villages of India
and that they should be based on the material available in and around the villages as
well as in keeping with rural economics.  Principally the mass awakening was to be
made from the point of view of prevention of diseases rather than from the point of
view of cure of the same.  From the latter view-point he emphasized the need for
evolution of a system of nature cure therapeutics based upon Ramanama and the five
elements of Nature : earth, water, air, sun, sky.
Mahatma Gandhi particularly emphasized the importance of Ramanama as the
basis of his system, and its spiritual singnificance in nature cure science.  He
explained that once he started the practice of nature cure of his conception in one the
villages around Poona, his idea would evolve a system of therapeutics which can be
spread through out the rural population of India. . . .
Mahatma Gandhi then suggested that Dr. Dinshaw Mehta should undertake a
trip to the different parts of India with the idea of studying various nature cure
institutions existing in the country. . . .2
From a fascimile : Mahatma , Vol. 7, between pp. 96 and 97
1 The speech is extracted from “Minutes” of the fifth meeting of trustees held
under the chairmanship of Gandhiji in his room in Nature Cure Sanatorium.  Dr.
Dinshaw K. Mehta and Jehangir P. Patel were present.  Gandhiji permitted Gulabanoo
D. Mehta also to attend the meeting.

71.  DRAFT  MEMORANDUM  TO  VICEROY1
[On or after March 8, 1946 ]2
We the signatories hereto are deeply grateful to your Excel-      
lency for receiving us at short notice in spite of your multifarious
preoccupations.
The present intention of the Government of the Union of        
South Africa will, if carried out, degrade us to a status of inferio-      
rity against which we have put up a fight more definitely since        
1893, the year in which an attempt was made to disfranchise the     
Indian community as such in Natal. We then looked upon it as                
a slur not only on the Indians in Natal but also on the mother     
country. Then there was no Union of South Africa. The Cape         
[Town] had practically no Indian question worth the name.             
Orange Free State had banished the few Indian traders it had and
prided itself on its thorough anti-Asiatic policy.  The Transvaal had a
sprinkling of Indian traders, hawkers and others.  The location system
later known as segregation had its rise there.  The whites in Natal had
deliberately and for their own sake invited the large number of
indentured Indians for their sugar and tea plantations. This indentured
population naturally drew the independent mercantile Indians.
One would have thought that the advent of Union would mean
the union of all the races of South Africa, i. e., the African (the
Negro), the European and the Asiatics (primarily and principally
Indians).  What a noble tradition such a union would have been for
the world.  But it was not to be.  On the contrary, the Union became
an anti-African and anti-Asiatic combine.  Every year of the progress
1Vide the preceding item.
2 ibidVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 53of the Union has definitely marked the progress of this combine and
the strenuous opposition to it by the Indian settlers and their
descendants as will be clearly seen by reference to the appendix A1
hereto attached.
We ask Your Excellency to approach the question from that
standpoint and no other.  The threatened legislation adumbrated by
Field Marshal Smuts which has hastily brought the delegation from
South Africa is a very large step, perhaps the largest yet made, in the
process of consigning the Asiatics to permanent inferiority.  Political
inequality was their end.  The wedge has now expanded into all round
inequality and inferiority.  Thus there are three segregations in which
the whites are inviting segregations of themselves in order to compel
the segregation of the other two. God has made man one great human
family. The white races of South Africa would make of it three
separate parts.
We have come all the way from South Africa not to seek
protection of individual or property rights, dear as both are, but we
have come definitely to ask Your Excellency and the people of the        
mother country to appreciate the fight for equality of status, which is
theirs as much as ours, and to give us as much help as possible for you
and them to give. What is attempted to be done in South Africa          
is a denial of the brave declarations made by the British and even the     
F. M. himself.
It has given us much pleasure to learn that the withdrawal           
of the British power in India in favour of elected Indian represent-     
atives is imminent. Then we submit that it is Your Excellency’s     
double and special duty to enunciate and so far as possible enforce
that policy in no uncertain terms in connection with the question
being submitted to you.
We submit that the least Your Excellency’s Government can do
is to withdraw the High Commissioner from South Africa and to
enforce economic and political sanctions.  We are not unaware that
they may mean very little material loss to South Africa.  We know that
counter-measures will cause no hardship. But our loss we count as
nothing compared to the moral value of the enforcement.2

CHI.  SORAB2,
Chi. Manilal met me.  He does not wish to join the deputation.
According to him, the deputation is a farce.  Many of the members
were drafted here.  A deputation so composed can have place on it
only for dummies.  If that is so, what purpose will Manilal’s inclusion
serve?  You and he are like blood-brothers, but there are differences
between you two even in the method of work.  What can be done in
these circum-stances?  So much from Manilal’s point of view.  But
you also need to think.  Do not involve me at all in this business
unless it is perfectly above board. If Manilal is making a mistake,
point it out to him and to me also.  But if you yourself are making a
mistake, wake up.  In the matter of public work, I want to see you to
be that.  You are, of course, a man of bright intellect.  Use it always to
strengthen your spirit of service.  The draft3 I have prepared        
deserves the most careful attention.  Cling to it at all costs.  Improve
you health.

79.  RAMANAMA,  THE  INFALLIBLE  REMEDY3
Shri Ganesh Shastri Joshi, vaidya, tells me after reading my  
article on nature cure4 in Harijan of 3rd March, 1946, that in     
Ayurveda too there is ample testimony to the efficacy of Rama-       
nama as a cure for all diseases.  Nature cure occupies the place of
honour and in it Ramanama is the most important. When Charaka5,
Vagbhata6 and other giants of medicine in ancient India wrote, the
popular name for God was not Rama but Vishnu. I myself have been
a devotee of Tulsidas from my childhood and have, therefore, always,
worshipped God as Rama.  But I know that if, beginning with Omkara
one goes through the entire gamut of God’s names current in all
climes, all countries and all languages, the result is the same.  He and
His Laws are one.  To observe His Law is, there-fore, the best form of
worship.  A man who becomes one with the Law does not stand in
1 According to report in The Hindu , 12-3-1946, Aga Khan celebrated “his
diamond jubilee” on March 10, 1946.  Gandhiji had expressed his inability to be

with whom contemplation of God has become as natural as breathing,
is so filled with God’s spirit that knowledge of obser-vance of the Law
becomes second nature as it were with him.  Such a one needs no
other treatment.
The question then arises as to why, in spite of having this prince
of remedies at hand, we know so little about  it, and why even those
who know do not remember Him or remember Him only by lip-
service, not from the heart.  Parrot-like repetition of God’s name
signifies failure to recognize Him as the panacea for all ills.
How can they?  This sovereign is not administered by doctors,
vaidyas, hakims, or any other medical practitioners.  These have no
faith in it.  If they were to admit that the spring of the Holy Ganges
could be found in every home, their very occupation or means of
livelihood would go. Therefore they must perforce rely on their
powders and potions as infallible remedies.  Not only do these provide
bread for the doctor, but the patient too seems to feel immediate
relief.  If a medical practitioner can get a few persons to say ‘So and
so gave me a powder and I was cured’, his business is estabished.
Nor, it must be borne in mind, would it really be of any use for
doctors to prescribe God’s name to patients unless they themselves
were conscious of its miraculous powers.  Ramanama is no copy-book
maxim.  It is something that has to be realized through experience.     
One who has had personal experience alone can prescribe it, not         
any other.
The Vaidyaraj  has copied out for me four verses.  Out of these
Charaka’s is the simplest and most apt. It means that if one            
were to obtain mastery over even one out of the thousand names of
Vishnu, all ailments would vanish :

MY  DEAR  C.  R.,
It is just 6.15 a. m. I am to be off to Bombay by 7.30 a. m.
1  This and the preceding item appear on the same sheet.
2 ibidVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 61If we discover a mistake, must we continue it?1 We began
making love in English—a mistake.  Must it express itself only by
repeating the initial mistake?  You have cake and eat it also.
Love is love under a variety of garbs—even when the lovers are
dumb. Probably it is fullest when it is speechless.  I had thought,
under its gentle unfelt compulsion, you will easily glide into HIndust-
ani and thus put the necessary finishing touch to your service of
Hindustani.  But let it be as you will, not I.2
I do not like your despondence.  You have to be thoroughly
well.  Why not come to me?  I hope to return in five or six days.  
This tamasha will vanish leaving the water of life cleaner for the
agitation.  If it does not, what then?
Anbudan3.

DEAR  MISS  SCHLESIN4,
You never write for the sake of writing.  But the letter before me
is the first such.
A highly industrial system under capitalism and full employ-
ment are incompatible.
Your proposition about Manilal needs revision.  But all such

Nagari is so illegible that I have only with great difficulty gathered what you wished
to tell me. . . . It won’t do to discard what we both know well and adopt deliberately a
difficult medium except occasionally as a joke! I shall begin replying in Tamil, if you
write to me in illegible Nagari!”

guilty and ask for mitigation.  Old age (not youth) being the excuse.  But don’t argue
further.  Your very sweetness makes me feel so guilty.”

86.  SHOCKING  IF  TRUE1
The Joint Secretary of the Gujarat Harijan Sevak Singh, Shri
Hemantkumar, writes that apart from Karadi nowhere are temples
open to Harijans, and nowhere may they use public wells.
If this is true, I may say it is a good thing that I have been
unable to go to Bardoli.2 How can those Gujaratis, who do not look
upon Harijans as part and parcel of themselves, who do not permit
them to draw water from public wells nor enter temples for the
worship of God, who even attribute epidemics to Harijans3 and are
prepared to beat them for practices which superstition attributes to
them, how can they welcome me?  Or what value can their welcome
hold for me?
I have long since counted myself as Bhangi in my speech, in my
actions and above all in mind and spirit. Anyone who looks upon
them with contempt does the same to me. Indeed I hold it an honour
to be among he despised Harijans and among the Bhangis. Any
welcome to me under the circumstances would be tantamount to an
insult.
Therefore I make this request to Gujaratis that they atone for the
grievous wrong they continue to do to fellow human beings. I shall
consider their repentance adequate when they admit Harijans into
their fold, and only then will I consider them capable of maintaining
swaraj.  I do hope that the people of Bardoli Taluka will understand
and respond to my message in a special manner.

Q.You ask people not to eat polished rice but I fear the disease
is too far gone.  Polished rice is washed again and again and the water
thrown away.  It is then boiled and that water too is emptied into the
drain thus depriving the cereal of all its vitamin value.  The rice thus
served, with each grain separate, is pleasant for both the eye and the
palate.  The practice obtains even in students’ hostels.  How are we to
get rid of it?
A.I am aware of the above-mentioned malpratice.  We live in
the poorest of poor countries and are yet unable or unwilling to give
up such harmful habits.  Each one thinks only of himself.  We look
upon our neighbours as strangers instead of as our kith and kin.  What
does it matter to us whether they live or die?  If they die, it is their own
fault.  If they live, it is accredited to their merit.  Life and death are
not in our hands.  Therefore let us eat, drink and be merry!
In such a distorted view of life, we have to follow what we
consider to be our duty and believe that what is true will one day be
followed.  Until then, whenever occasion arises, we must proclaim
from the house-tops what we consider to be right.  
Q.You say that those who eat fish should be provided with the
same.  Does not this entail violence both for him who eats and him
who provides the fish ?
A.Both commit violence.  So do those who eat vegetabes.  This
kind of violence is inherent in all embodied life, therefore, in man too.
It is in this condition, and in spite of it, that we have to practise non-
violence as a duty.  I have often indicated how we may do so.  Then
man who coerces another not to eat fish commits more violence than
he who eats it.  Fishermen, fish-vendors and fish-eaters are probably
unaware of any violence in their action.  Even if they were, they might
look upon it as unavoidable.  But the man who uses coercion is guilty
of deliberate violence.  Coercion is inhuman.  Those who quarrel
among themselves, those who will stoop to anything in order to amass
wealth, those who exploit or indulge in forced human labour, those
who overload or goad or otherwise torture animals, all these knowin-
gly commit such violence as can easily be stopped.  I do not consider
1 Originally written in Gujarati, this apperared as “from Harijanbandhu ”
published simultaneously with the source.64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIit violence to permit the fish eater to eat fish.  It is my duty to suffer it.
Ahimsa is the highest duty.  Even if we cannot practise it in full, we
must try to understand its spirit and refrain, as far as is humanly
possible, from violence.

88.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  BOMBAY1
March 11, 1946
The news of the recent events in Bombay has filled me with
shame and humiliation as it must have you too.  Let me hope that
none of those who are here took part in these disgraceful happenings.
but that would not entitle you to my congratulations. We have reached
a stage when no-body can afford to sit on the fence or take refuge in
the ‘ambiguous mid-dle‘. One has to speak out and stand up for
one’s convictions. Inaction at a time of conflagration is inexcusable.
Is it too difficult an ideal to follow?  Let me tell you, however, that this
is the only course that will take us safely through the present difficult
times.
It has become the fashion these days to ascribe all such ugly
manifestations to the activities of hooligans.  It hardly becomes us to
take refuge in that moral alibi.  Who are the hooligans after all?  They
are our own contrymen and, so long as any countryman of ours
indulges in such acts, we cannot disown responsibility for them
consistently with our claim that we are one people.  It matters little
whether those who were responsbile for the happenings are
denounced as goondas or praised as patriots—praise and blame must
equally belong to us all.  The only manly and becoming course for
those who are aspiring to be free is to accept either whilst doing our
duty.
In eating, sleeping and in the performance of other physical
functions, man is not different from the brute.  What distinguishes him
from the brute is his ceaseless striving to rise above the brute on the
moral plane.  Mankind is at the cross-roads.  It has to make its choice
between the law of the judgle and the law of humanity. We in India
deliberately adopted the latter twenty-five years back but, I am afraid,
1 This appeared under the title “For Shame!”.  The meeting was held at Rungta
House.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 65that whilst we profess to follow the higher way, our practice has not
always conformed to our profession. We have always proclaimed from
the house-tops that non-violence is the way of the brave, but there are
some amongst us who have brought ahimsa into disrepute by using it
as a weapon of the weak.  In my opinion, to remain a passive spectator
of the kind of crimes that Bombay has witnessed of late is cowardice.
Let me say in all humility that ahimsa belongs to the brave.  Pritam1
has sung : “The way of the Lord is for the brave, not for the
coward.” By the way of the Lord is here meant the way of non-
violence and truth.  I have said before that I do not envisage God
other than truth and non-violence.  If you have accepted the doctrine
of ahimsa without a full realization of its implications, you are at
liberty to repudiate it. I believe in confessing one’s mistakes and
correcting them.  Such confession strengthens one and purifies the
soul.  Ahimsa calls for the strength and courage to suffer without
retaliation, to receive blows without returning any.  But that does not
exhaust its meaning. Silence becomes cowardice when occasion
demands speaking out the whole truth and acting accordingly. We   
have to cultivate that courage, if we are to win India’s independence
through  truth  and  non-violence as proclaimed by the Congress.  It is
an ideal worth living for and dying for.  Every one of you who has
accepted that ideal should feel that inasmuch as a single English
woman or child is assaulted, it is a challenge to your creed of non-
violence, and you should protect the threatened victim even at the cost
of your life.  Then alone you will have the right to sing : “The way of
the Lord is for the brave, not for the coward.” To attack defenceless
English women and children, because one has a grievance against the
present Government, hardly becomes a human being.
The British Cabinet Ministers’ Delegation will soon be in our
midst.  To suspect their bona fides  in advance would also be a variety
of weakness.  As brave people it is our duty to take at its face value the
declaration of the British Ministers that they are coming to restore to
India what is her due.  If a debtor came to your house in contrition to
repay his debt, would it not be your duty to welcome him?  On the
other hand, would it not be unmanly to treat him with insult and
humiliation in rememberance of past injustice? Let the British
1 A Gujarati poet66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIGovernment prove for the final time that they do not mean to act
according to their professions.  It will be time to act, if they do so.
Till then the only manly course is to maintain dignified silence.1

Letters are being received in large numbers from patients
wanting to be admitted to the Nature Cure Clinic at Poona.  Let me
inform them that no such facility exists at present.  The standard of
cleanliness that was intended to be introduced into the institution has
not been reached. Work for the village people has not yet been
started. So long as the preliminary adaptations are not complete,
nothing can be done. The patients have, therefore, to wait. Dr. Dins-
haw Mehta’s Nature Cure Clinic at Bombay is no doubt there. He may
open branches at Poona and Sinhagarh also. But since he has
undertaken heavy responsibility in connection with the Nature Cure
Trust, all this may take time.  For private patients the scale of his fees
will continue as before.

March 12, 1946
Mahatma Gandhi, speaking at the conclusion of the prayers this evening,          
made a reference to the collection of money and ornaments during his recent tour of
Bengal1 and Madras2.  He said that he had recently been on a long tour of Bengal,     
Assam and Madras, and passed through Orissa when he came back to Wardha.  A large
number of sisters and brothers gave him ornaments and money for the Harijan Fund.      
He collected them every day.  But today, he said, somebody had given him some     
presents which he wanted to auction.  He demanded that they should have to pay       
double the price of those presents.3
Mahatma Gandhi announced that he would not sign autographs this evening
and asked the seekers of his autographs to send their books with a sum of Rs. 5 per
autographs to him later.

March 12/13, 19462
Gandhiji repeated to them the advice3 he had previously given to some 
discharged I.N.A. men who had met him in Madras.  He had told them that                        
it should be derogatory to the dignity and self-respect of a soldier to live upon        
charity.  The ideal which they should set before themselves was to earn their bread by
honest industry.  The I. N. A. Relief-Fund was there but it would be wrong to use it for
providing doles.  He described to them how in South Africa he had provided relief to
dependents of satyagrahi prisoners by settling them on Tolstoy Farm where they had
to labour according to capacity.  The merit of this method was that it could be
multiplied to any degree without proving costly and burdensome.  The real test of the
I. N. A., he told them, was to come only now.  In the fighting line there was the
romance and incitement, not so in civil life.  The country was today faced with the
spectre of famine.  Would they help the people to fight it with the same courage,
cohesion, doggedness and resourcefulness which they had shown on the battlefield?
Would they show the same diligence, mastery and skill in handling the spade, the
pickaxe and the hoe as they did in shouldering the rifle?  Digging of wells and
breaking stony ground to grow food, and plying the wheel and the shuttle to clothe
the naked was the nation’s need today.  Would they respend to the call?  They had
physical stamina, discipline and, what was more, a feeling of solidarity and oneness,
untainted by narrow communalism.  All that ought to put them in a singular position
of vantage for introducing non-violent discipline and organization among the
masses.  Constructive activity could absorb every one of the I. N. A. men who was
willing and worthy of his name.  If they took up that work, not one of them need or
would remain unemployed.4
Harijan, 31-3-1946
1 The talk is extracted from Pyarelal’s “Ideals for the I. N. A.“; Pyarelal
explains: “I. N. A. men . . . were anxious . . . to distinguish themselves in national
service on the non-violent lines but unless they were suitably absorbed in civil
activities and properly guided they might be exploited and led into devious ways by
unscrupulous agencies. . . .”

The Bombay High Court has just delivered an illuminating
judgment, allowing two habeas corpus applications of H. K. Shah and
B. E. Sathe against detention orders extended from time to time.
Chief Justice Stone and Justice Lokur have delivered a considered
judgment setting at liberty the two applicants who were evidently
illegally detained and might have remained under detention but for
the fact that Advocate Purushottam Trikumdas assisted them to bring
their cases before the Bombay High Court.  I have just time to give
below the few important extracts from the judgment.
After observing that the two affidavits filed by Mr. Simms,     
Home Secretary, Government of Bombay, in relation to the two    
accused cannot be distinguished from each other except for the
numbers at the tops, the learned judges go on to say :
In the case of Mr. Sathe, there is no suggestion in the reasons given that
he assisted or supported any underground organization or organized anything
underground, though it is suggested that he assisted the activities of an
organization, the object of which was to commit acts of sabotage, and even if
it is to be presumed that such an organization would work underground, the
very fact that these two affidavits of Mr. Simms are in identical terms, though
they deal with the circumstances of two different cases, demonstrates a very
casual approach to the grave responsibilities and duties, which devolve on
every Government servant charged with these wide powers of detention
without trial.
In Gokhale’s case, a full bench of this High Court had occasion to
comment upon detention orders being made on cyclostyled forms
inappropriate to the facts of the particular case, and it now appears that, unless
checked, the era of the cyclostyled affidavits is about to dawn.  Even passing
over such irregular features in Mr. Simms‘s affidavits as referring to an
affidavit without stating whose affidavit it is he refers to, his affidavit does
not even state that all the circumstances of the petitioner’s case were fully
considered before the extension orders of the 7th January, 1946, were made.   
 Commenting upon the further affidavit of Mr. Simms which he
filed after declining to attend the court in order to submit himself to
cross-examination, the judges observe :
That is a very remarkable document for anyone to file who has been given
an opportunity by the Court to attend the Court in order to give viva voce70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIevidence.  It is even more remarkable by its omission than by what it says, for
it leaves unchallenged the affidavits for the 22nd February of the two
petitioners filed in answer to Mr. Simms’s two affidavits which are in identical
terms, and which the last affidavit seeks to amend.
Referring to the extension orders, the learned judges go on to
observe :
But once the original order has run its course, the legislature has    
provided certain safeguards for the protection of the persons detained.    
Before the six months expired, the person detained will have received           
the notice giving him the grounds for his detention, and he may have                
a representation under Section 7.  The extension order itself has to                   
be made within thirty days immediately preceding the expiry of the      
previous order and, lastly, there is added to subjective satisfaction an
objective test that the detaining authority shall have further considered         
all the circumstances of the case.  In our opinion emphasis is to be placed on
the word “all”, and the question at once arises what is the nature of “all the
circumstanes” which have to be considered.  That must be a question of law.
[Upholding]1 the defence plea that the detaining authority had
not considered all the circumstances of the case, the judges observe :
Mr. Purushottam Trikumdas advanced various heads of circumstances
which he submits is obligatory for the detaining authority to consider.  In our
opinion it is clear that such circumstances must include :
1.A consideration of the matters and things which the detenu did, or
was suspected of doing, when the original order was made.
2.These matters and things must be considered in conjunction with,
and in the highlight of, the present state of affairs.  That is to say, the state of
affairs existing in India at the date when the proposed extension order is to be
made.
3.A cosideration of any representation which the person detained may
have made under Section 7 (4), and consideration of the person detained since
his detention, and the present state of his health.
Turning again to the circumstances of the two cases before us, having
given  the whole position our careful cosideration, we are not prepared to
accept the affidavits of Mr. Simms filed on either of these petitions as
affording any reliable answer to the assertion of the petitioners that all the
circumstances of their cases have not been considered in the light of the state
of the state of affairs current in India on the 7th January, 1946.  On that date,
1 The source has “Holding that“.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 71as the petitioners point out, there was no successful prosecution of a war for
the mass movement to hinder, and the various committees of the Congress,
previously unlawful, had been legalized, and the members of the Working
Committee of the Congress Party and its leader had been released from
dentention.  These are all circumstances which already ought to have been
considered before the renewal orders of the 7th January, 1946, were made.
The judges then draw attention to the fact that Mr. Simms did
not state that H. E. the Governor had considered the papers and
agreed to the extension orders of 7th January, 1946, being made.  The
judges say :
It is extremely significant that His Excellency did not consider and    
agree to the making of these extension orders though he had considered        
and agreed to the making of all the orders in both the cases in 1944                
and    1945.    If  he  had  done  so   when  the  orders  of  the  7th  January,  1946
were made, it is inconceivable that Mr. Simms should not have stated that
most important fact which is bound to inspire confidence that any order which
has been so considered and agreed to has been made after due care, attention
and consideration.
Therefore they hold that the two petitioners have
successfully challenged the two extension orders of the 7th of January as not
being validly made, because, having referred to the facts stated by the
petitioners, it is impossible to come to the conclusion that the detaining
authority complied with the objective test of having cosidered all the
circumstances of the petitioners’ cases. . . .  That being so, it is our clear duty
to order their immediate release.
In my opinion the released men are entitled to damages for
illegal detention.  This, however, may be debatable.  But there can be
no doubt that all persons similarly detained, no matter in which
province, should immediately be discharged without a doubt.  There is
no danger of the Government being overturned by reason of the
discharges.

work as  has the fullest approval of Sardar Patel.  I have been acting
on this rule from the beginning, and I have advised others to do the

99. LETTER TO T. PRAKASAM
BOMBAY,
March 13, 1946
BHAI PRAKASAM,
I have your letter dated 2-3-1946 as well as the papers. The
papers were not necessary.
I did not say I saw nothing wrong in your using the money for
your own purpose. I do not have here the copy of my earlier letter.
But as far as I remember I had said that Kala Venkatarao had
expressed that opinion. Read the letter again. In my view, it is wrong
to take money like that for personal expenses. Be that as it may, it is
your duty to explain your position to the public. I am hearing bad
reports.
Sardar has sent me copies of your letters and his reply. I think
Sardar’s reply is appropriate.

1 Nrisinhprasad K. BhattVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 75100.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  BOMBAY1
March 13, 1946
Gandhiji explained a certain bhajan2 —God’s path is that of a brave man.  He
said that the words God and Truth were synonmous.  Of the million names of God, the
best and the choicest was Truth.
Truth itself is God, and non-violence is just a synonym for
truth.3
People ought to be prepared to uphold truth and non-violence at all costs, even
at the cost of death, just as they would be prepared to sacrifice their lives for God, as
was stated in the bhajan.
Briefly referring to the recent disturbance in Bombay, he said that those who
were responsible for looting did it in ignorance and under misguidance.  They did not
do it of their own free will.  Gandhiji said, he would not call them hooligans.4  In
Bombay much violence was indulged in recently and many shops were looted.
Nothing would be gained by such violence and looting.  On the other hand, only truth
and non-violence would achieve the freedom of India.
In the end, Gandhiji exhorted the audience to pray to God so that He may grant
them strength and determination to die in the cause of the country.
Earlier Gandhiji asked for the approval of the audience, if he could speak in
Hindustani at tomorrow evening’s prayers and day after’s.  He offered the option of
Gujarati.  But the approval of the audience went in favour of Hindustani.

creating democray and humanity.  Our non-violene now is a matter of conviction and
not a matter of convenience or cowardice.
But then there are others who. . . . are still thinking in terms of power         
and organization for power.  I personally feel that that is a phase in their
development. . .
There are also many that are confused with this game of politics and find it
difficult to square it with the non-violent way or are rather confused by the spectacle
of many attempting to square non-violence with the game of politics. . . .
I feel that we are fighting a war for humanity and. . .  that only with rugged
fearless experience, and perhaps a few stumblings, shall we be able to grow into non-
violence.
Perhaps there are many who experience my difficulties.

102.  COMMUNAL UNITY  AND  NON-UNTOUCHABILITY
IN  THE  I. N. A.
The Azad Hind movement in East Asia solved many problems.               
And one of them was the major and intricate problem of communal            
unity. Although efforts towards this direction were made ever since the
inception of the movement in 1942, it became a reality only after the      
arrival of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.  There was another question and       
that was of untouchability, though on a minor scale. . . .  Anyhow this ill   
too was remedied as a result of universal training of Indians in the I.N.A.
camps and offices after Netaji‘s arrival. . .  Netaji had asked for ‘total
mobilization‘ for the coming armed struggle for India‘s freedom.  To               
this call . . . all sections of the community. . . offered their service as . . .
volunteers.  Some of these volunteers were absorbed in the Azad Hind Sangh,
the party behind the Azad Hind Fauj and the Azad Hind Government.  Others– a
majority of the volunteers–joined the ranks of the Fauj.  The Sangh had a
network of branches throughout East Asia.  In every branch workers
consisting of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians. . . lived together ate, at
the same table and worked together.  Same was the case in the Indian National
Army. . . .VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 77Note :  Except for repetitions, the foregoing1 is published as it
was received.  The information is revealing.  The natural question is:
Now that these soldiers have returned, will the same comradeship
persist?  It ought to.

I understand H. E.’s proposal to be this : “He, as President,

unreal and, therefore, defeat the purpose in view.  Then you asked   
whether I could see the possibility of Maulana A. K. Azad being
invited to work with me assisting him. I said, there might be a
possibility in   it, I being regarded as an expert in such matters.  But I
added that everything else without an executive of elected represen-

I gladly accepted the dispensation, I thought, when I had slept over the

8-11-1906 in his dispatch dated March 15 to the Secretary of State of India, the
Viceroy, inter alia , said : “I sent Abell to Bombay to see Gandhi, and he saw him on
the 13th evening.  That day Working Committee had decided that an Advisory
Committee on food would be useless without a popular Government at Centre and that
Congress should not co-operate.  Gandhi . . . reminded Abell of long dispute about
representative capacity during his conversations at Bombay with Jinnah.  He was
determined not to be representative of Congress and he admitted that if Azad was put
up by Congress, Jinnah would never accept.  Abell suggested that willingness of
Gandhi and Jinnah to . . . discuss . . . in the interest of India . . . would augur well for
immediate future.  Gandhi said, if he thought it right to do this, he would do it, but his
instinct was strongly against it . . . .  I see no use pursuing matter further and shall
drop it with minimum publicity. . . .  In incidental conversation, Gandhi said to Abell
that Jinnah could certainly have for his Pakistan the genuine Moslem areas.”

Many thanks for your kind note.3  The reason for my putting in

misunderstanding about the position.  I would not like to put you or
me in any false position and certainly not H. E.  As it is you will agree

message you had brought me. Of course I have no intention of
publishing anything.  I have to say something to the Working

5 This paragraph is from The Bombay Chronicle .80 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThe singing of Ramdhun is the most important part of
congregational prayer.  The millions may find it difficult to correctly
recite and understand the Gita verses and the Arabic and Zend-Avesta
prayers, but everybody can join in chanting Ramanama or God’s
name.  It is as simple as it is effective.  Only it must proceed from the
heart. In its simplicity lies its greatness and the secret of its
universality.  Anything that millions can do together becomes charged
with a unique power.
I congratulate you on your success in the mass singing of
Ramdhun  without any previous training.  But it is capable of further
improvement.  You should practise it in your homes.  I am here to
testify that when it is sung in tune to the accompaniment of tala, the
triple accord of the voice, the accompaniment and thought creates an
atmosphere of ineffable sweetness and strength which no words can
describe.
Gandhiji said that my prayer, will-power and mental concentration were
developed.  This lesson he had learnt during his experience over many years, from the
time he first started satyagraha.1
I introduced the practice of having congregational prayer some
time before the commencement of the South African satyagraha
struggle.
He said that in India there were only a few foreigners, and the native
population numbered millions.  Yet the former dominated over the latter.  In South
Africa, on the other hand, Indians were few while Europeans and the natives there
numbered several millions.2
The Indian community there was faced with a grave peril.  We
did all that was humanly possible. All methods of seeking redress,
agitation through the Press and the platform, petitions and deputations
were tried but proved of no avail. What was the Indian community
consisting of a mere handful of illiterate indentured labourers mostly,
with a sprinkling of free merchants, hawkers, etc., to do in the midst of
an overwhelming majority of Negroes and whites?  The whites were
fully armed.
What could a handful of Indians . . . do against the armed might of the South
African Government?  The utmost that they could do was to plead with the
Government in power.  The richer sections might even send deputations to England.

2 This paragraph is from The Hindu.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 81Beyond that they could not go.  In these circumstances there was nothing that one
could do.  He could not give guns in the hands of this handful of men and say :
“Fight”.  He could not drill them into an army and then parade them.1
It was clear that if the Indians were to come into their own, they
must forge a weapon which would be different from, and infinitely
superior to, the force which the white settlers commended in such
ample measure.  It was then that I introduced congregational prayer in
Phoenix and Tolstoy Farm as a means for a training in the use of the
weapon of satyagraha or soul-force.
As a practising satyagrahi and the author of satyagrahas, he could say that its
seed lay in prayers.  Satyagraha could be pitted against all earthly powers for it was a
divine power.2
The root of satyagraha is in prayer. A satyagrahi relies upon
God for protection against the tyranny of brute force. Why should
you then be always afraid of the British or anybody playing you
false? If someone deceives you, he will be the loser. The fight of
satyagraha is for the strong in spirit, not the doubter or the timid.
Satyagraha teaches us the art of living as well as dying. Birth and
death are inevitable among mortals.
These higher attributes of how to live worthily and lay down one’s life nobly,
were what satyagraha could teach man.  A person who did not understand these twin
arts was no true satyagrahi.3  In the vast world every creature had to live, work and die.
It was a very common phenomenon.  But these creatures could not realize the potent
force that could be derived from God.  That was because they did not know the art of
sacrificing their lives, which satyagraha involved.
Gandhiji said that so far as purely animal functions like eating and breeding
and living and dying were concerned, there was no difference between man and beast
and birds.  But man rose above them all, for he alone could recognize the good and the
true, he alone could realize God.4
What distinguishes the man from the brute is his conscious
striving to realize the spirit within. The last eighteen verses of the
second chapter of the Gita which are recited at the prayer give in a
nutshell the secret of the art of living.  It is given there in the form of
a description of a sthitaprajna  or the man of steady wisdom, i. e., a
satyagrahi, in reply to Arjuna’s query to Lord Krishna.
The art of dying follows as a corollary from the art of living.

4 This paragraph is from The Bombay Chronicle.82 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIDeath must come to all. A man may die of a lightning stroke or as a
result of a heart failure or failure of respiration.  But that is not the
death that a satygarahi can wish for or pray for himself.  The art of
dying for a satyagrahi consists in facing death cheerfully in the
performance of one’s duty. That is an art which the people of
Bombay apparently have not yet learnt.
Referring to the mutiny of the ratings of the R. I. N. in Bombay and                 
the distrubances that followed, Mahatma Gandhi said that everything that                   
was   done   during   these  days  was  motivated  by   a  desire  for  freedom.    But  those
who took part in these did not know the art of satyagraha.  Unfortunately many
buildings were looted and burnt, many people were assaulted and many died.1
Judged from these standards, the men who died in the recent disturbances had
thrown away their lives.  It was a waste of many lives.  There was nothing worthy or
artistic in looting ships, and exercising violence on the foreigners who were going
about their business.  The men who did it were no satyagrahis.  The men who looked
on without helping were also no satyagrahis.
It is not enough not to want to hurt or take the life of your
enemy. You are no satyagrahis, if you remain silent or passive
spectators while your enemy is being done to death.  You must protect
him even at the cost of your life.  If thousands in India learnt that art,
the face of India would be changed and no one would be able to point
his finger of scorn at her non-violence as being a cloak for weakness.
We would not then try to shift blame for ugly happenings on the
hooligan elements. We would convert and control the hooligan
elements too.
We are passing through a crisis in our history.  Danger besets us
on all sides.  But we shall convert it into our opportunity, if we realize
the power of satyagraha than which there is nothing more potent on
earth.2
In a brief reference to the impending Cabinet Mission to India, the Mahatma
counselled patience.  He would indicate the next step, if the mission failed to
implement the pledges and promises made to India.

2 What follows is from The Bombay Chronicle.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 83109.  THOUGHTLESSNESS1
[Q.]  You are aware that pari passu  with the growth of popular outbreaks, the
lawlessness of the military is also becoming more and more brutal.  You have
condemned the hooliganism of the masses but you say nothing about the brutality of
the military.
[A.]  This is a specimen of thoughtlessness. People have   no right
to commit excesses whereas the military is the very embodiment of
madness. Condemnation of military madness would be meaningless
when the very institution of the army is condemned.  But criticism of
their conduct becomes necessary as a warning to the Government.
There is a time and occasion for everything.  It would be out of place
when condemning popular excesses.
What is the duty of a satyagrahi general?  Should he reform his
own army or that of the opponent?  If he reforms his own, the power
of the opposing force is sterilized.  If the process continues over a
sufficiently long period, the opponent is ipso facto completely
transformed.  The critic’s remark can only be meant for me.  Others
have already condemned military excesses.  In my opinion, we have
not as yet got sufficient material to judge them.  I expect that this is
being prepared.  The duty of the people, however, is to turn the
searchlight inwards.  Too much brooding over the wrongs of others is
apt to lead one imperceptibly to act likewise.  It would then be a case
of the pot calling the kettle black.

 110.  “A  TEMPLE  TO  GANDHIJI”
Under this strange heading I read a newspaper cutting sent by a
correspondent to the effect that a temple has been erected where my
image is being worshipped. This I consider to be a gross form of
idolatry. The person who erected the temple has wasted his resources
by misusing them, the villagers who are drawn there are misled, and I
am being insulted in that the whole of my life has been caricatured in
that temple. The meaning that I have given to worship is distorted.
Worship of the charkha lies in plying it for a living or as a sacrifice
for ushering in swaraj. The Gita is worshipped not by parrot-like
recitation but by following its teaching.  Recitation is good and proper
only as an aid to action according to its teaching. A man is worsh-
ipped only to the extent that he is followed, not in his weaknesses but
1 Originally written in Gujarati, this appeared under “Notes” as “from
Harijanbandhu ” published simultaneously with the source.84 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIin his strength.  Hinduism is degraded when it is brought down to the
level of the worship of the image of a living being.  No man can be
said to be good before his  death. After death too he is good for the
person who believes him to have possessed certain qualities attributed
to him.  As a matter of fact, God alone knows a man’s heart.  Hence
the safest thing is not to worship any person, living or dead, but to
worship perfection which resides only in God known as Truth.  The
question then certainly arises as to whether possession of photographs
is not a form of worship carrying no merit with it. I have said as much
before now in my writings.  Nevertheless I have tolerated the practice
as it has become an innocent though a costly fashion.  But this
toleration will become ludicrous and harmful, if I were to give directly
or indirectly the slightest encouragement to the practice above
described.  It would be a welcome relief, if the owner of the temple
removed the image and converted the building into a spinning centre
where the poor will card and spin for wages and the others for
sacrifice, and all will be wearers of khaddar.  This will be the teaching
of the Gita in action and true worship of it and me.

CHI.  JIVANJI1,
Pyarelal must have replied to your letter yesterday. This
morning Lilavatibehn drew my attention to a Gujarati article,
“Vicharonun Gharshan ”2 in Harijanbandhu .  I would not call such
Gujarati as lucid or simple.  I have no time to suggest improvements.
Here I will give only guidance.  The translation should not be literal.
The sense should be rendered in Gujarati.  We may keep the English
before us in order to preserve continuity of thought, but the transla-
tion should be free.  The rendering “Praised khichri3 sticks of the
teeth”,4 is no translation at all.  We should think and find an English
equivalent for the Gujarati saying.  One way of saying it would be,
“Praise spoils”5.  Complex sentences in English may be broken up
for facility of translation.  This is not by way of criticism, but a first
lesson.

1Gandhiji left for Poona on the 16th.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 87115.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  BOMBAY1
March 15, 1946
Announcing that this was his parting speech, Gandhiji said that he had been
told that on the previous day many people did not understand what he said.  He asked
those present, if they could follow Hindustani.  On their assenting, he congratulated
them and said that it was the good fortune of India that there were so many languages
in it.  These languages were not barbarous or something to be discarded.  They were
great languages; but in places like Bombay it was necessary for the people to know
more than one language.  Bombay’s women folk had some knowledge of both
Gujarati and Marathi merely by living together.  But he wanted that they                
must make some special effort.  They must learn their mother tongue; otherwise it
would amount to treachery.  They must also know Hindustani.  Every man in whose
heart burnt the flame of Indian freedom must know Hindustani.  In places like Bombay
it would be necessary to know a third language also.2
Gandhiji said, he was leaving Bombay the next day.  Therefore he wanted to
give them a parting message.  He wanted to tell them about nature cure.  He had
written about that subject but had not done much work.  Nature cure was not like a
doctor giving medicine in a bottle.  It was really the natural way of keeping health
and happiness.  They might be surprised to hear him say so; all the same he would
assert that Ramanama was an item in nature cure.
It is not claimed that nature cure can cure all diseases.  No
system of medicine can do that, or else we should all be immortals.
But it enables one to face and bear down with unperturbed equanimity
and peace of mind an illness which it cannot cure.  If once we decide
that what cannot be shared by the millions should be taboo for us, we
are driven to nature as the only cure —all for the rich and the poor
alike.
In the armoury of the nature curist, Ramanama is the most
potent weapon.  Let no one wonder at it.  A noted Ayurvedic physi-
cian3 told  me the other day : ‘All my life I have been administering
drugs. But since you have prescribed Ramanama as a cure for phys-
ical ailments, it has occurred to me that what you say has too the
authority of Vagbhata and Charakha.  The recitation of Ramanama as
a remedy for spiritual ailments is as old as the hills.  But the greater

ailment.’  He will only tell about the all-healing principle that is in
every being and how one can cure oneself by evoking it and making
it an active force in his life.  If India could realize the power of that
principle, not only would be free but we would be a land of healthy
individuals too—not the land of epidemics and ill-health that we are
today.
For a long time he had been preaching that if all India learnt the doctrine of
satyagraha, it would get freedom.  He was so convinced of it that if the whole world
opposed him, he would still assert it.  He was equally convinced that Ramanama could
help a man in ill-health.1
The potency of Ramanama is however subject to certain
conditions and limitations. Ramanama is not like black magic. If
someone suffers from surfeit and wants to be cured of its aftereffects
so that he can again indulge himself at the table, Ramanama is not for
him.  Ramanama can be used only for a good, never for an evil end,
or else thieves and robbers would be the greatest devotees.  Ramanama
is for the pure in heart and for those who want to attain purity and
remain pure. It can never be a means for self-indulgence. The remedy
for surfeit is fasting, not prayer. Prayer can come in only when fasting
has done its work.  It can make fasting easy and bearable. Similarly
the taking of Ramanama will be a meaningless farce when at the same
time you are drugging your system with medicines. A doctor who
uses his talent to pander to the vices of his patient degrades himself
and his patient.  What worse degradation can there be for man than
that, instead of regarding his body as an instrument for worshipping
his Maker, he should make it the object of adoration and waste money
like water to keep it going anyhow.  Ramanama on the other hand
purifies while it cures, and, therefore, it elevates.  Therein lies its use as
well as its limitation.2
Gandhiji explained that he had been practising nature cure even from the days
when he was a barrister.  But the realization had come to him late in life that he could
use it for work in the villages, for the service of the hungry millions.

No, I won’t.  Why can’t you see the beauty of colour in
vegetables?  And then there is beauty in the speckless sky.  But no,
you want the colours of the rainbow which is a mere optical illusion.
We have been taught to believe that what is beautiful need not be
useful, and what is useful cannot be beautiful.  I want to show that
what is useful can also be beautiful.

[On or before March 16, 1946 ]
In the case of the ordinary method of treatment, the patient     
comes to the doctor to take drugs that would cure him. The            
doctors prescribe the drug. With the relief of abnormal symptoms          
in the patient, his function ends and with that his interest in the       
patient.  The nature cure man does not ‘sell a cure’ to the patient. He
teaches him the right way of living in his home which would not only
cure him of his particular ailment but also save him from falling ill I
future. The ordinary doctor or vaidya is interested mostly in the study
of disease.  The nature curist is interested more in the study of health.
His real interest begins where that of the ordinary doctor ends; the
eradication of the patient’s ailment under nature cure marks only the
beginning of a way of life in which there is no room for illness or
disease.  Nature cure is thus a way of life, not a course of ‘treatment’.

120.  WHY  FOR  HARIJANS?  1
Q.The Harijans are specially favoured by the Government.  Special facilities
are provided on an extensive scale for their education, employment and advancement.
Why should you again seek our help on their behalf?  There are equally poor and even
poorer people among the savarnas.  Why don’t you work for their betterment?
A.This is a curious question.  It is no wonder that Harijans are
favoured by the Government.  Whatever the reason, the fact is not to
be deplored, if the favour really does them good.  All Government
favours do not.  The motive behind seems to me to divide them from
the so-called touchables.  The reason lies with the latter.  If touchables
had not misbehaved themselves, there would have been no division
possible.  And even though the Congress has been championing them
all these years, have the savarna Hindu masses improved their
manners?  The answer has to be ‘No’ even though there has been
considerable improvement.  The Congress influence is most powerful
for ending foreign rule. It is weak on social matters. Therefore,
without entering into an unholy competition with the foreign
Government, it is necessary for the reformers to do their duty by the
Harijans until the bar sinister is completely removed. As for the
savarna poor, there are many to look after them.  Some go to the

On the United Press representative drawing his attention to the morning
papers, which contained Mr. Attlee’s speech4 in the House of Commons, and saying
“Bapuji, swaraj is coming”, Gandhiji gave a hearty laughter and said :
Is that so?  But you have been telling me so often that swaraj is
coming.  I shall be glad when you will bring me the news that swaraj
has already come.
On being requested to express his views on the implications of Mr. Attlee’s

anything on it at present.

BOMBAY,
March 16, 1946
Shri Sriramulu is an unknown poor Congressman and servant of
humanity working in Nellore.  He has been labouring single-handed
for the cause of the Harijans of that place.  There was a time when
high hope was entertained about removal of untouchability and other
social work in Nellore.  An ashram was built near Nellore but for a
variety of causes the activity received a set-back. Deshabhakta Konda
Venkatappayya was, and still is, though very old, the moving spirit in
connection with these activities.  It is in this place that Shri Sriramulu
has been quietly and persistently working for the removal, root and
branch, of untouchability. He has been trying to have a temple
opened to Harijans.  He asked me the other day whether, in order to
awaken public conscience in favour of such opening, he could, if all
other efforts failed, undertake a fast.  I sent him my approval.1  Now
the place is astir.  But some persons have asked me to advice Shri
Sriramulu to suspend his fast for removing legal difficulties of which I
have no knowledge.  I have been unable to give such advice.  As I am
anxious that an unobtrusive servant of humanity may not die for want
of public knowledge and support, I bespeak the interest of the
journalists of the South, if not all India, to find out for themselves the
truth of the matter and, if what I say is borne out by facts, shame by
public exposure the opposing parties into doing the right and save a
precious life.2

[On or after March 16, 1946 ]1
[ALEXANDER :]   As outsiders we hope we can play a useful part by providing a
link between the people and the Government.  The Government is not suspicious of
us, and they have the reassurance that we won’t suspect their motives.  What is more,
we are not regarded with suspicion by the people as the Government is.  If you think
that we should go ahead, you might say something which would encourage and help us
and also strengthen the hands of our agents in America in obtaining an adequate quota
of food supplies.
Gandhiji in reply commended the example of Ruey Alley, the New     
Zealander and his companion George Hogg in connection with the organization of
Indusco2 in China. Although they were foreigners, they inspired the Chinese         with
self-confidence. There was, of course, the other side3 of the picture too.  As      for F.
A. U.’s4 Plan of work for the prevention of famine, while generally approv-  ing of it,
Gandhiji did not like the idea of what he called “begging for food from outside”.
If food comes, it would be welcome.  But we should not       
depend on it.  India is the granary of the East and now she has               
to go a-begging for food to America and other countries.  I do             
not like this.  Somehow or other, if we rely on self-help, strength
comes, we do not know from where.  Probably it comes from the
original source, and people feel they need not die.  Moreover arrival
of food in the ports by itself would not solve the problem unless it is
1 The talk appeared under the title “Constructive Non-violence”, as reported      
by Pyarelal on March 23, 1946, from Uruli-Kanchan.  According to Pyarelal,   
Horace Gundry Alexander, a Birmingham lecturer and member of Quakers’ India
Conciliation Group, “accompanied Gandhiji to Poona”, presumbly, when Gandhiji
returned from Bombay on March 16, after the Congress Working Committee
meeting.
2 A war-time plan of Chinese co-operative in India whose activities were
carried on under abnormal circumstances with the backing of the Chinese National
Government
3 According to Harijan, the work of foreign missionary enterprise, which
organized Indusco, “was tainted by the proselytization motive”.
4 Friends Ambulance Unit’s; Horace Alexander was one of its members.
Pyarelal explains that the Unit, formed as a war-time organization in 1914, was in
action during Bihar earthquak (1934), Midnapore cyclone (1942) and Bengal famine
(1943).  Another like-minded body, American Friends Service Committee, joined the
Unit in 1944, and “the two have been working as a single agency . . . operating food
canteens and orphanages for children. . . providing medical relief . . . employment . ..
and forming . . . co-operatives. . . . With the threat of India-wide famine . . . the
Friends Ambulance Unit has again begun to organize for action.”94 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImade available where it is most needed. Distribution is the real
problem.  Unless it is tackled, there is danger that the food will rot in
the ports while people are dying in the interior.  At present it seems
almost a hopeless task through the present corruption.  A Government
official sent a note the other day showing how it would be at least two
months between the arrival of the food ships in the ports and the food
actually reaching the affected areas.  In the mean time what are the
people to do?  I have, therefore, suggested that they should utilize the
sub-soil water to grow whatever they can by their own efforts. If
crores take up the cue, they can do much to save themselves even
before the food arrives from outside.
Horace next told Gandhiji that the F. A. U. are developing work of a more
permanent nature for the upliftment of Bengal villages.  For instance, they are trying
to attack the problem of poverty from four or five different angles simultaneously.
They had discussed the question with Pandit Jawaharlal Nahru who had approved of the
idea for two reasons.  With the coming of freedom, he felt, we might help in post-war
economic rehabilitation so that the high expectations entertained by the people of
the national government might not be belied.  Besides a body of people from the
West serving the people here would act as an antidote to racial feeling which might
otherwise oversweep the country in the first flush of freedom.  Gandhiji agreed
entirely with Pandit Nahru.
Any person who does such work is worth his weight in gold.
Pandit Nehru has done well to point to the danger signal.
But he felt that the danger was even deeper.  The face of the picture as he
viewed it seemed horrifying.  The feeling towards Europeans was rising all though the
East.  There were so many complex forces working on the mass mind.  If the
maelstrom broke out, the F. A. U. might have to bear the brunt of it.  They must be
prepared for that sacrifice.  But whilst they should be prepared for the worst, he
wanted them to share with him the hope that all woould be well in the end.
To see the danger clearly and yet to remain unperturbed in the
face of it, trusting to God’s goodness, is true wisdom.

125.  DECIMAL  COINAGE  AND  ITS  COST
After due sanction required by Section 153 of the Government
of India Act, 1935, a Bill further to amend the Indian Coingage Act,
1906, is said to have been introduced in the Legislative Assembly on
the 18th February, 1946.  If it becomes law, the rupee will be
equivalant to 100 cents instead of 64 pice.  The consequential changesVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 95will naturally follow.  The object1 is stated to be :
Modern trade and commerce demand speed and simplicity in the methods
of computation, to achieve which there is nothing to compete with the
decimal system which has gradually displaced all other systems in most of the
advanced countries of the world.  Public opinion has expressed itself largely in
favour of the adoption of decimal coinage in India . . .
And a note2says :
During the transition period when both the . . . coins will circulate side
by side and prices might be quoted in terms of either . . . the Bill provides for
conversions involving smaller fractions to be made in rupees of any one
transaction. . .
Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala has studied the question carefully
and has come to the conclusion that whilst in theory the introduction
of the decimal coinage may be defensible, in practice, for some years
to come, the poor will be sacrificed as usual in the interests of the
modern trade, i. e., the rich merchants. It is unnecessary here to
summarize his convincing argument in support.  It is given in full in
the columns of the Harijanbandhu .  It is sufficient here to state that
even in the country of the rulers, the decimal coinage has not been
introduced.  Public opinion there commands respect and affects the
decisions of the House of Commons.  In India, public opinion, such as
it is, has very little force and, moreover, the opinion of the millions
who will be the sufferers is inarticulate.  Shri Mashruwala very aptly
points out that the poor  will be taxed without the odium of additional
taxation. Wisdom would have suggested that if the power is to be
transferred inside of a few months to the representatives of the people,
it would be improper for the Government to embark upon an
experiment even though claimed to be scientific and yet manifestly
against the immediate  interests of the poor.  In a poor country like
India, often the immediate  is, as in this case, the decisive factor.  It is
to be hoped that the Central Legislative Assembly will throw out the
Bill if, on re-considration, the Government do not withdraw it.3

Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala writes :1
This letter deserves to be studied.  He has pointed out a few
instances of the immediate impact of decimal system on ordinary
people.  Thoughtful readers can think of other instances which will go
to prove that the loss to the poor on introducing the decimal system is
likely to be very great.  It is easy to support the system on scientific
grounds.  But popular dealings are not based [on science].  India is an
unfortunate country where all manner of experiments are carried on
in a high-handed manner, and at the cost of the public exchequer, and
the people have had to suffer in the name of science.  Would this be
the last gift [of the British] to India on the eve of their leaving?  Even
though the purpose of this Bill may be good, it should be abandoned.
When the people come to power, they may adopt the decimal system.
They may put up with the losses, if any, in adjusting to it.  But it is the
duty of the Legislature to defeat this Bill.

I have gone through some of the chapters of Bhai Jugatram’s
Ashrami Kelavani2.  The language is not only simple and interesting,
but it is apt even for the villagers.  The author has described in a very
interesting way all the trivial as well as vital aspects of the Ashram life.
He has shown that though the Ashram life is a simple one, real joy and
art are to be found in it.  Whether my assessment is right or wrong, the
reader should judge after reading the entire book.

MY  DEAR  SRIRAMULU ,
I write in English because others may understand what I have
written.
Here is a letter from G. Ramachandra Rao.  Your fast is good.  I
know you are suffering.  I do not mind it.  I am doing all I can to
reach a proper solution on merits.  Your fast is intended, or should be
intended, only to quicken lazy conscience, if conscience can ever be
lazy. If what Ramachandra Rao says can be sustained, you may
postpone the fast as distinguished from abandoning it altogether.  If
approval by the Provincial Government is necessary, and if the trustees
honestly work for it, there is no occasion of the fast.  I hope you will
survive the ordeal.

The foregoing statement2 was issued on the 16th instant.  A wire
was received today from Shri Sriramulu to the effect that he yielded to
public pressure and broke his fast3. I can be glad only if the ending of
the fast means that the public has taken over the responsibility of
having the temple opened without delay.  Prof.  Ramachandra Rao’s
letter received by me shows that there is a real legal difficulty about
the opening, and the principal trustee is pledged to have the formality
gone through and the temple opened. It is to be hoped that the temple
would be opened with the willing consent of the temple-going people.

Today it is celebrating the spring carnival in a mood of gaiety.
Gandhi in his turn was happy when I met him, for Mr. Attlee’s speech in the
Indian debate6 had just opened the road to independence.  He looked well and very
much less than his age. . . . His manner was never solemn and often he relaxed in a

15-3-1946100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhumorous chuckle.  In a way, hard to define, one felt that this man was speaking for
India . . . .  He warned me, nonetheless, that he would be speaking only for himself
and not for the Congress.  Our talk took its start from the Prime Minister’s
recognition of India’s right to choose independence.  This, Gandhi welcomed, and not
only this, but the whole tone of the speech.  He went on :
But I can’t forget that the story of Britain’s connection with
India is a tragedy of unfulfilled promises and disappointed hopes. We
must keep an open mind. A seeker of truth will never begin by
discounting his opponent’s statement as unworthy of trust. So I am
hopeful, and, indeed, no responsible Indian feels otherwise. This time
I believe that the British mean business. But the offer has come
suddenly.  Will India be jerked into independence?  I feel today like a
passenger who has been hoisted in a basketchair on to a ship’s deck in
a stormy sea and has not yet found his feet.  There should have been
some psychological preparation, but even now it is not too late. The
tide of bitterness had risen high and that is not good for the soul. The
last two months should have been filled with generous gestures.  This
is a milestone not only in India’s history and Britain’s, but in the
history of the whole world.
Gandhiji’s meaning was clear.  The British Government had done the right
thing, but in its manner of doing it, he missed the big touch.  When I asked him for
concrete illustrations, he chose two.  The release of the political prisoners had been
gradual and was still incomplete.  [He added :]
There was no danger to fear.  If independence is coming, would
these men have opposed it?  A complete amnesty would have captured
the people’s imagination.  When you are about to transfer power, you
should do it boldly.
He went on to speak of the Salt Tax.
Its abolition would be a gesture the poorest peasant could
understand.  It would mean even more to him than independence
itself.  Salt in this climate is a necessity of life, like air and water.  He
needs it for himself, his cattle and his land.  This monopoly will go,
the instant we get independence.  Then why not abolish it today?  By
such acts the Government could have created a feeling among the
masses that the new era has already dawned. . . .
I . . . reminded Gandhi that many Englishmen find it hard to understand why
Indians prefer independence to Dominion Status.  His answer was startling.
There was a time when I used to swear by Dominion Status, and
actually preferred it to independence.  That was my attitude during
the first World War.  I even used, in writing1 to Lord Chelmsford, the
Viceroy of those days, an expression that has often been quoted
1Vide “Letter to Viceroy”, 22-6-1920VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 101against me.  I wanted to evoke in the Indian breast the same loyalty to
the British Crown that there is in the breast of an Englishman.  It was
an English footballer who converted me to independence.
With a laugh, Gandhi explained that he was referring to C. F. Andrews, who
had been a notable athlete at Cambridge, as well as a don.  Gandhi added :
Andrews made me understand the significance of the King-
Emperor’s title.  The British king is king also in the Dominions,         
but he is the Emperor of India.  India alone makes the Empire.          
The Dominions are peopled by your cousins.  But we Indians, with
our different culture and traditions, can never belong to the British
family.  We may belong to a world-wide family of nations, but first we
must cease to be under-dogs.  So I set myself to win independence.
You may object that by so doing I am throwing away the protection
of the  British army and navy.  India would not need them, if she were
truly  non-violent.  If, in the glow of freedom, she could live up to that  
creed, no power on earth would ever cast an evil eye upon her.  That
would be India’s crowning glory and her contribution to the world’s
progress.
If only Englishmen could follow this argument of mine, they
would make their offer of independence in a different tone altogether.
Today they insist that Dominion Staus is the best gift they can
possibly bestow :  ‘For the world’s sake and for ours as well as your
own, you shall have independence today, even as we have it. . . .’
I asked Gandhi to face the anxieties of his English listeners and tell them
whether whether Indian independence would make for Britain’s security and the
world’s.  He answered that the British need never fear an independent India.  If they
leave India as willing friends, she in her turn will always remain friendly.  But
Britain, I told him, might hope for some assurance of friendship.  Would an
independent India be willing to enter into an alliance with Britain?  Gandhi’s answer
came promptly :
Supposing India said ‘No’, would you make the recognition of
India’s independence contingent upon her entering into an alliance
with Britain?  If you did that, it would immediately lower the value of
your offer and rob it of all grace. The proper attitude is to meet
India’s claims as a matter of right, even if she wanted to be unfriendly
and pay you back in your own coin.  No calculations entered into the
British mind, when they settled with the Boers at the end1 of a bloody
war, and the Boers have stayed friends ever since.
I replied that Britain has made up her mind to end the coercive connection  
with India.  But living as she does in a perilous would it is inevitable that she should
ask the question whether as an ally in a defensive war she would be entitled to use
1  On May 31, 1902102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIndia’s strategic bases and ports against India give a reassuring reply?  Gandhiji
answered :
Englishmen must learn to be Brahmins, not Banias.  The Bania, I
should explain, is the trader, or as Napoleon put it, the shopkeeper.
The Brahmin is the man who is intelligent enough to rank the moral
above the material values of life.
A Gujarati novelist has said that Englishmen are soldiers and
Brahmins, but not Banias. That was a generous verdict, but it was
mistaken.  Englishmen have still to evolve the Brahminical spirit. Even
the British soldier still calculates and bargains like a Bania, and fails to
reach the highest type of courage. I still cherish the hope that the
British will respond to the non-violent spirit of India.  As the author of
that movement, I know what it has meant for the world. The non-
violent spirit is the greatest thing in life. I feel it is my responsibility to
help my brothers not to degrade themselves by bargaining.  If you
and we can rise to this moral height, no danger can alarm us.  It is
probable that many members of the Congress will not take this view
and may be willing to discuss an alliance today.  But independence
would come free as air; don’t let us bargain over it.
In reply to a further question, whether a defensive alliance might be discussed
when independence is ratified by treaty, Gandhi replied :
If India feels the glow of independence, she probably would
enter into such a treaty of her own free will. The spontaneous
friendship bet-ween India and Britain would then be extended to other
powers and among them, they would hold the balance, since they
alone would possess moral force.  To see that vision realized, I want to
live for 125 years. . . .
He said that he hoped for a mutually helpful commercial treaty between a
friendly Britain and an independent India.  For goods that India needed to import, he
was even ready to give Britain a preference.
While we talked of Pakistan, Gandhi said that if no other method of solution
succeeded, he was prepared to submit the whole issue to international arbitration.  Nor
should we forget that expedient, if any insoluble question arose between Britain and
India, for example, over debts.  But he saw no blank wall of difficulty ahead.  His last
words were that difficulties make the man.1
Harijan, 14-4-1946
1 Brailsford concluded : “I came away with the sense that I had been talking to a
brave man who has the courage to believe that human society can be built only on
moral principles.  Amid our preoccupations over military perils, he stands aloof and
repeats with unshaken faith his creed that safety is attainable, only when men learn to
treat each other as brothers and equals.  No lesser means will avail.”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 103

143.  STATEMENT  TO  THE  PRESS 2
Course of events has raised the question of South Africa
whiteman’s policy to the highest level.  Unseen, it holds the seeds        
of a world war.  The threatened Land and Franchise Bill which has
brought the South African Indian delegation3 to India, though
superficially it affects the Indians of Natal and the Transvaal, is            
in effect a challenge to Asia and by implication to the Negro races.       
India in her present exalted mood can view it in no other way.        
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is Indian to the core but, being also                 
an internationalist, he has made us used to looking at everything in the
international light instead of the parochial.  India, weak physically and
materially but strong ethically and numerically, has proclaimed from
the house-tops that her independence would be a threat to no one and
no nation, but will be a help to noble effort throughout the world and
promise of relief to all its exploited peoples.  Therefore India regards
the contemplated measure of the Union of  South Africa as an insult
and challenge to them.4
The Indian deputation see in the present measure not merely an
assault on Indian property rights but also on their status as free men.
They do not want merely to exsit in South Africa. They need not have
sent the deputation all the way to India for that purpose.  They want to
be in South Africa as equals of the European settlers of South Africa.
1 Vide “Letter to Mirabehn”, 18-3-1946
2 This appeared under the title “Indians in South Africa”.  According to The
Bombay Chronicle , 20-3-1946, the statement was released on March 19.
3 For their memorandum to the Viceroy, vide “Draft Memorandum to Viceroy”,
8-3-1946. and “South African Indian Deputation’s Memorandum to the Viceroy”,      
12-3-1946
4 For resolution by the Congress Working Committee, vide “Congress
Working Committee Resolution on South Africa”108 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThey know that today they are not.  But they must stop deterioration
and hence move forward. In that forward march India will help, of
course. Indeed all the moral forces will be at their call. The brunt,
however, will have to be borne by them.  They rediscovered the force
of Truth (Satyagraha) and that will be their only and ultimate source
of power.  Time for it is not yet.  Let us hope, it will never come.
They have to try together on their side all the moral forces of the
world. They will have to clear the ground of all the weeds, all sordid-
ness, all personal ambition which always and everywhere creeps in, if
sleepless vigilance is not kept on the watch-tower.  Imagine the plight
of a poor barque sailing when the beacon light in front has gone out.
They must be prepared for accidents and consequent suffering.
If they are in earnest and hardy enough to brave the worst, they are
bound to come out the best in the end.
What about the whites of South Africa?  They invited the
Indians in the first instance.  If they had thought the invitees would
always be like slaves or that they would not be followed by their free
brethren, they (the whites) were soon undeceived.
Does real superiority require outside props in the shape of
legislation? Will they see that every such wall of protection        
weakens them, ultimately rendering them effeminate ? The lesson of
history ought to teach them that might is not right. Right only is
might. Field Marshal Smuts is a great soldier-statesman.  Will he not
perceive that he will be taking the whitemen of South  Africa down the
precipice, if he persists in the policy underlying his measure?  Let him
take counsel with the Allies to whose victory on the battlefield he
contributed not a little.  He will surely throw away its fruits, if he
persists in his plan of protecting the civilization of the West by
artificial means.

144.  FAMINES  AND  BIRTH  RATE
Maj. Gen. Sir John McGaw, President, India Office Medical
Board, is reported by a correspondent to have said :
Famines in India will recur; in fact India is today facing perpetual famine.
Unless something is done to decrease the birth rate in India, the country will
be heading straight for a calamity.
The correspondent asks what I have to say on this grave issue.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 109For me this and some other ways of explaining away famines in
India is to divert the attention from the only cause of recurring
famines in this benighted land.  I have stated1, and repeat here, that
famines of India are not a calamity descended upon us from nature
but is a calamity created by the rulers—whether through ignorant
indifference or whether consciously or otherwise does not matter.
Prevention against drought is not beyond human effort and ingenuity.
Such effort has not proved ineffective in other countries.  In India a
sustained intelligent effort has never been made.
The bogey of increasing birth rate is not a new thing.  It has
been often trotted out.  Increase in population is not, and ought not, to
be regarded as a calamity to be avoided.  Its regulation or restriction
by artificial methods is a calamity of the first grade whether we know
it or not. It is bound to degrade the race, if it becomes universal which,
thank God, it is never likely to be.  Pestilence, wars and famines are
cursed antidotes against cursed lust which is responsible for unwanted
children.  If we would avoid this three-fold curse, we would avoid too
the curse of unwanted children by the sovereign remedy of self-
control.  The evil  consequences  of artificial methods are being seen
by discerning men even now.  Without, however, encroaching upon
the moral domain, let me say that propagation of the race rabbit-wise
must undoubtedly be stopped; but not so as to bring greater evils in its
train.  It should be stopped by methods which in themselves ennoble
the race.  In other words, it is all a matter of proper education which
would embrace every department of life; and dealing with one curse
will take in its orbit all the others.  A way is not to be avoided because
it is upward and therefore uphill.  Man’s upward progress necessarily
means ever-increasing difficulty, which is to be welcomed.

I hope you will arrange for me to stay in the Bhangi colony.

For the nature cure clinic I must select some village.  I am
looking around for it here.  My plan is that the period form February
to the end of July should be spent in a comparatively cool place,
including April and May in the hills.  This arrangement cannot be
made in Gujarat.  Abu is the only hill station, and it does not have a
climate comparable to that of Panchgani or Mahabaleshvar.  Nor have
I found cool climate like that of Poona anywhere in Gujarat.  I am
telling you all this in order that you should have nothing to complain
about later.  However, do you think one could find a place in Gujarat
where nature cure work could be done and also where the above
conditions be satisfied?  And would you really prefer it?  Nature cure
is no longer a hobby with me.  I must try it out in detail.

were uncertain, I had thought of saving time by not writing to you.
But now it is doubtful whether you will get this letter.  Your letter of
the 17th came into my hands just now (after the morning prayers).
I understand about Chi. Kanchan. Since my own plans are
uncertain, I would advise you not to bring along Kanchan.  Moreover
Chi. Kanu has gone over there and is busy with the preparations for
the camp.  It will, therefore, be convenient, if Kanchan is there.  Abha
is here, for very few women are joining the camp, and Kanu has
detained Abha here thinking that she will be able to go in the
company of some lady from the Ashram.
What you say about Annapurna is quite true.
Blessings to you both from

You must learn to strike a balance.  Maybe, it is for you the last
and sole remaining step.  I see no sense in a man undertaking a fast to
get rid of his excess fat resulting from overeating.  It is my experience
that a man who eats a balanced diet and the one who eats little fare
better than one who undertakes fasts.  The place that is then left for
fasting is divine.
I agree that the manager of the Ashram should be of mature age
and experience. I shall understand better, if you elaborate the point

158.  CONGRESSMEN  APATHETIC
Q.I am glad that you have expressed yourself in the matter of
opening a temple to Harijans in Nellore.1  It should open the eyes of
1 Vide “Statement to the Press”, 16-3-1946116 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImany Congressmen.  The reason given for unwillingness to open the
temple was that it might adversely affect the chances of Congress
success in the elections.
A.If this represents the general sentiment, it augurs ill for
Congress.  Even a popular, democratic, India-wide organization like
the Congress cannot afford to be untrue to its policy (if it may not be
called creed) of removing untouchability, root and branch. Through-
out my close contact with the Congress, ever since my return to India
in 1915, I have found that the more the Congress has held to its main
purpose, the more popular it had become.  A democratic organization
has to dare to do the right at all cost. He who panders to the
weaknesses of a people degrades both himself and the people and
leads them not to democratic but mob rule.  The line of demarcation
between democracy and mobocracy is often thin but rigid and
stronger than steel, unbreakable.  The one leads to life and progress,
the other is death, pure and simple. In the ultimate analysis, the cause
of our fall is to be sought from within and not from without.  All the
empires of the world could not have bent us, if as a people we had
been above suspicion and temptation.  This may not be regarded as a
mere truism.  If we recognize the fundamental facts, we would be true
and patient and able to deal with whatever difficulty that may face us
whether from within or without.  Preparedness to lose all elections
rather than sacrifice a principle, is the surest way to success at every
election.  The results prove that the policy laid down by the Congress
in 1920 has led to success from stage to stage, but only to the extent
that the Congress has been true to the fundamentals of the policy, it
accepted during that eventful year.  Untouchability is to go, if India is
to live and thrive as a nation.

matter sufficiently in advance in order that the Navajivan press might
cope with the simultaneous issue of Harijan in English, Hindustani
and Gujarati.  I am, therefore, obliged from time to time to sendVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 117matter of immediate importance to the Press in advance of the
publication of Harijan.  It is likely, I fear, that this would be a regular

CHI.  LILAVATI ,
One should never rush in haste to a conclusion.  An institution
cannot transgress its framework of rules whether good or bad.  What
you write about the medical [technique] is not something which can
be summarily dismissed. Vijaya should firmly stick to her studies.  No
one forbids her to study. In the meanwhile she will have an
opportunity to take the examination.  We can easily absorb her in the
Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Trust work when she is fully
qualified even before her examination.  Don’t let her lose heart.  Nor
should you despair in her case.  Let me know, if there is any hitch in
her attending the classes.  I shall be prepared to have her examined
privately.
All of you have to learn the lesson from Vijaya’s case that a
degree [by itself] does not qualify one, although it will often be a sign
of being qualified.  One does come across such cases nowadays.  If a
person has the same name as a degree-holder’s, or adopts it, then
steals the certificate and puts up a sign-board, would people go to him
for long?  Have there been any such cases?  I have very little
knowledge of all this.  Hence it would be more than having a degree,

163.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  POONA
March 21, 1946
Gandhiji said that he had fought many battles in his life.  There was one more
battle to be fought which was quite different from others and that was of nature cure.
He had known Dr. Dinshaw Mehta for a long time and became a cotrustee with
him of the Nature Cure Trust to turn Dr. Mehta’s clinic into am institute for the poor.
But he had found that he could not serve the poor remaining in Poona.  The rich could
afford to go to hospitals and clinics and get the services of doctors, but the poor could
not move away from their homes and villages.  If he was to teach them the method of
nature cure and serve them, he had to go to them.  He had studied nature cure and
practised it.  Now, in the evening of his life, he had undertaken as part of his life’s
work the bringing of nature cure within the reach of the poor millions.  He was going
to the village of Uruli1 to work and try his experiment there.

173.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  URULI-KANCHAN
March 22, 1946
Gandhiji announced . . . that he would receive patients from the following day,
examine them and prescribe treatment for their maladies.  If he found the place
suitable, and if he had to go elsewhere for some work, he would leave behind two
competent men to continue his work.
Mahatma Gandhi said that Ramdhun  was the most effective remedy for
physical and mental ailments.  He said that no doctor or vaidya could promise cure by
medicine.
1Vide also “Letter to G. E. B. Abell”, 23-3-1946124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIBut God would certainly relieve you of your pains and worries,
if you pray to him.  But for the prayer to be effective, one must
participate in Ramdhun whole-heartedly and then only one would feel
peace and happiness.
In the song that we have just sung the devotee says : “O Hari,
you are the reliever of the people’s distress.” The promise here is
universal.  It is not qualified or restricted to any particular kind of
ailment. . . . If you are subject to anger, eat and sleep for indulgence,
not solely for sustenance, you do not know the meaning of
Ramanama. Your recitation of it is mere lip-service.  Ramanama to be
efficatious must absorb your entire being during its recitation and
express itself in your whole life.1
Gandhiji said that he had come to Uruli because he felt that if he was to serve
the poor through nature cure, he must go to their cottages in villages.  He had been
practising nature cure for the last 50 years, but that was for the benefit of himself and
a few friends.  Until this time he had not felt the urge to extend his activities and now,
in the evening of his life, he had taken this work of propagating nature cure to the
poor.  He believed that the poor would be benefited by nature cure as also the rich.

GANDHIJI :  I am glad to hear that.  For, so far you have mostly
been instrumental in the suppression of Indian freedom.  Have you
heard of Jallianwala Bagh?
Oh, yes.  But those days are past.  We were, in those days, like the proverbial
frog-in-the-well.  We have now seen the world, our eyes have been opened.  We admit
we are mercenaries.  But our hearts are no longer so.
I am glad to hear that.  But, let me tell you, my use of that
1 This paragraph is extracted from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter—I”.
2 This is extracted from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter—II”.  Pyarelal explains : “In
Uruli there is a big military camp.  Hardly a day passed, after Gandhiji’s arrival in
Uruli, when a group of Indian military men did not contact him.  They met him during
his morning walks, they were at his evening prayer gatherings, but particularly
interesting were the two batches who saw him at his residence.”
3 Gandhiji reached Uruli-Kanchan on March 22.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 125expression1 was not intended to cast any reflection upon you.  It was
only descriptive of a soldiery that serves a foreign Government for a
living.  My use of that expression at the time brought a hornet’s nest
round my ears.  But I could not withdraw it; I said, our present army
system should go.
What would be our position when India is independent?
Why, you will fully share that independence and breathe the air
of freedom with your countrymen.  Independent India will have need
of you.  You have had military training. You will give India the
benefit of that training. You have learnt the lesson of comaraderie
under common danger. It would be a bad day, if the moment that
peril is lifted, the lesson is lost. But in free India you won’t be
pampered as you are today. You won’t have these lavish privileges
with which a foreign Government bribes you at the expense of India’s
poor. India is destitute. You cannot serve her unless you are prepared
to share her destitution.  I told2 Capt. Shah Nawaz that if the I. N. A.
people succumb to the lionization of an India pining for freedom, and
forget her destitution, they will earn not the blessings but the silent
execration of their countrymen. The same applies to you.  Unless you
are prepared to forgo your privileges, you will feel sorry when
independence comes, and sigh for the return of old times and old
masters.
There was a time when we were not allowed to read any civil newspapers.  And
now we go and tell our officers that we are going to see our greatest leader, and no one
dares to stop us.
I know, there is a new ferment and a new awakening among all
the army ranks today.  Not a little of the credit for this happy change
belongs to Netaji Bose. I disapprove of his method, but he had
rendered a signal service to India by giving the Indian soldier a new
vision and a new ideal.
How anybody can think of dividing India into two, three or more parts, we
army men are at a loss to understand.  We know only one India for which we have
fought and shed our blood.
Well, it requires all sorts to make the world.
May we shout slogans?

[Before March 23, 1946 ]2
GNADHIJI :   I could have understood it, if they had combined
from top to bottom. That would, of curse, have meant delivering India
over the rabble. I would not want to live up to 125 to witness that
consummation.  I would rather perish in the flames.
The Mission are coming fresh after a bloody victory. They     
have now an opportunity to add to it the laurels of a bloodless        
peace.  It will be a glorious thing for them and the world, if they rise
to the occasion and do justice to India even though it might mean
reducing themselves (it won’t be so in fact) to insignificance.  That
would be the height of non-violence.  But miracles have happened in
the world.
ENGLISH  FRIEND :   So you believe in miracles?
I do and I do not.  God does not work through miracles.  But
the divine mind is revealed in a flash and it appears like a miracle to
man.  We do not know God, we know Him only through the working
of His law.  He and His law are one.  There is nothing outside His law.
Even earthquakes and tempests do not occur without His will—not a
blade of grass grows but He wills it. Satan is here only on His
sufferance, not independently of Him.
By justice do you mean that they should agree to withdraw the British army
without stipulating any conditions?
I do.  Freedom will be truly won only when the British army is
withdrawn from the whole of India, not excluding Indian States.
Otherwise it would be sinister.
Harijan, 7-4-1946
1 This is extracted from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter—II.”  Pyarelal explains :
“Gandhiji was discussing some time back with an English friend the difficult task
ahead of the Cabinet Mission.  There was an unprecedented upsurge for independence
among the masses on the one hand and on the other, what he had called ‘the unholy
combination’ at bottom among the Hindus and Mussalmans for a joint violent
purpose.”

Q.What to do when the local Congress machinery refuses to act
or work in a way which is effective?
A.A person who is a real Congressman will, in such circumst-
ances, himself act singly or in co-operation with others purely in a
spirit of service and give all the credit to the Congress organization.
Supposing that many persons acted thus, Congress would rise from
day to day. Ineffective workers would be shamed into becoming
effective, the Congress machinery always remaining clean and intact.
“In a spirit of service” is here the operative phrase.  If the spirit is
that of aggrandizement, although the work done may be effective,
credit will probably go to the aggressor and the Congress will lose.
That the aggressor will lose in the end need not be stressed.
Q.What should a Congress worker do when he faces a situation
at a place which is outside his area of work?
A.Areas are prescribed for workers for their weakness, not         
for their strength. For a strong Congress worker all India is             
the area of his work, and he will be found every time in the area      
where he is wanted most. Naturally he will be never regarded as an
intruder or as an officious man. Appreciation of the service will be
uppermost in the minds of all.  It would be ludicrous and a sign of
impotence, if a Congressman passing through an area not his own and
finding a battle royal between two factions does not interpose himself
between them, even at the cost of his life, on the untenable plea that
the trouble was outside his area.
Q.Can the same person take up parliamentary work, constru-
ctive work as distinguished from the parliamentary and the organiz-
ation work of the Congress, in addition to working for his own
livelihood?
A.He must be a modern Hercules who can effectively do these
things at the same time. I can conceive the possibility of the same
person managing all these departments with a staff of efficient
secretaries and clerks working under him. The point of the question,
however, is wholly different.  Division of labour is a necessity. One-
man-show is always undesirable and is a positive hindrance to a
system of organization.  An organization like the British kingship is
not personal.  “The King is dead.  Long live the King.” Hence the
saying, “the King can do no wrong.” A king as an individual may be128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIa rascal but personified as an organization he is perfect in the sense
the word ‘perfection’ is understood in a given society.  The moral is
that however inefficient the persons in charge may be in the begin-
ning stages, in a progressive organization, persons taking charg should
be above board and should put the organization first, themselves last.
If an attempt is made to organize work through rascals, the organiza-
tion will always have rescals at its head.
Q.August 1942 has brought a psychological change in the
public mind. They do not await orders from the Congress for
observance of days, etc.  Other parties often take advantage of this
spontaneous effort and associate their programme with it, while
official local Congress either keeps mum or inactive.  It also often
happens that programmes and policies as laid down by the Working
Committee are not automatically adopted by the Provincial Congress
Committees or are sometimes worked out half-heartedly.  Some also
refuse to create a machinary for it, till they are officially called upon
to do so.  In such circumstances, what is expected of Congressmen?
A.This is a good question. If Congressmen have really          
learnt to act for themselves since August 1942, it is a great  thing.  But
I do not believe it. Those only act for themselves who think for
themselves. It does not matter whether in doing so they make
mistakes.  A child often stumbles before it begins to walk.  Therefore
the effort ceases to be spontaneous or individual when one associates
with any programme that comes his way.  The secret of the August
resolution was that when the Congress as an organization ceased to
function every Congressman became his own master, which is wholy
different from becoming a pawn in any other person’s or group’s or
party’s game.
The second part of the question shows also that 1942 did not
teach Congressmen to think and act independently. If they had learnt
that lesson truly and well, any programme laid down by the Working
Committee would be followed by Congressmen whole-heartedly and
the response from Provincial Committees and all constituent elements
would be spon-taneous, such that the whole organization would move
like one man.  Such was my expectation in 1942. That it was not so
fulfilled is a matter of history. That the people acted somehow,
without being paralysed by the wholesale onslaught of the Govern-
ment, stands to their credit. How much more creditable it would have
been, if they had fully carried out the policy of non-violence
explicitly laid down in that resolution!  If my argument is correct, itVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 129follows that Congressmen with understanding would follow implicitly
laid down in the resolution!  If my argument is correct, it follows that
Congressmen with understanding would follow implicitly the Working
Committee’s resolutions without reference to the action of their
neighbours. When organizational effort stops or is neutra-lized or
becomes ineffective, every individual belonging to it holds him-self
responsible for the activity of his organization and then gradually
builds it up.
Q.When sporadic strikes are such as cannot be supported by
the Congress, what should Congressmen and the public do to put an
end to them?
A.In the first place, if the Congress organization were
complete, there would be no sporadic strikes, and any other strike
would be unjustified for the simple reason that a people’s organiza-
tion must shoulder the burden of every justifiable strike within the
sphere of that organization. But today unhappily the Congress,
powerful as it is, has not attained that supreme position.  Hence every
sporadic strike has to be judged on merits irrespective of the party that
has made itself responsible for it.  And, when a strike is indefensible
on merits, the Congress and the public should unequivocally condemn
it.  The natural result would  be that the men on strike would go back
to work.  If the strike is justified, the institution against which it has
been declared would be likewise condemned, if it employs black-legs
or other questionable means to force strikers into submission.

177.  CAPITALISM  AND  STRIKES
How should capital behave when labour strikes?  This question
is in the air and has great importance at the present moment.  One way
is that of suppression named, or nicknamed, ‘American’.  It consists
in suppression of labour through organized goondaism .  Everybody
would consider this as wrong and destructive.  The other way, right
and honourable, consists in considering every strike on its merits and
giving labour its due—not what capital considers as due but what
labour itself would so consider and enlightened public opinion
acclaim as just.
One preliminary question will justly arise : why should there be
a strike at all in any well-regulated concern?  Strikes ought to be130 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIimpossible when there is perfect understanding between capital and
labour, mutual respect and recognition of equality. And since
differences there would be sometimes between employers and
employed even in the best-regulated concerns, why should there not
be a system of arbitration between the parties so that they will always
readily carry out in perfect good faith awards of arbitrators?
But we have to consider things not as they should be but as they
are.  As time progresses, the labour world is getting more insistent in
its demands which are daily increasing, and it does not hesitate to
resort to violence in its impatient enforcement of those demands.  New
methods of enforcing them are being employed. Workers do not
hesitate to injure the property of the employers, dislocate machinery,
harass old men and women who would not join the strike and forcibly
keep out black-legs.  In these circumstances, how are the employers to
behave?
In my opinion, employers and employed are equal partners    
even if employees are not considered superior.  But what we see today
is the reverse.  The reason is that the employers harness intelligance
on their side.  They have the superior advantage which concentration
of capital bring with it, and they know how to make use of it.  One
individual rupee has very little potency, but when  money  combines
as  capital,  the  combine  derives a power different from and far in
excess of the mere sum total of the individual rupees.  A million drops
individually are negligible.  But in combination they make the ocean
carrying on its bosom a fleet of ocean hounds.  Whilst capital in India
is fairly organized, labour is still in a more or less disorganized
condition in spite of unions and their federation.  Therefore it lacks
the power that true combination gives.
Moreover it lacks intelligence, so much so that individuals fight
against individuals, unions against unions.  Lack of intelligence leads
to its exploitation by selfish and unscrupulous men even to the point
of creating and promoting mischief.  They know no better, being
ignorant of the secret of non-violence.  The net result is that the
workers suffer.  If labour were to understand the working of non-
violence, the power generated by combination would any day exceed
the power of dead metal in the hands of a few capitalists.
Hence my advice to the employers would be that they should
willingly regard workers as the real owners of the concerns which they
fancy they have created.  They should further regard it as their duty
to equip the employees with sound education that would draw out theVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 131intelligence dormant in them and gladly promote and welcome the
power that this combination of the workers gives them.
This noble work cannot be done in a day by the employers.
Meanwhile what should those do who have to face the destruction
wrought by strikers in their concerns?  I would unhesitatingly advise
such employers that they should at once offer the strikers full control
of the concern which is as much the strikers’ as theirs.  They will
vacate their premises not in a huff but because it is right, and, to show
their goodwill, they would offer the employees the assistance of their
engineers and other skilled staff.  The employers will find in the end
that they will lose nothing. Indeed their right action will disarm
opposition, and they will earn the blessings of their men.  They will
have made proper use of their capital.  I would not consider such
action as benevolent.  It would be an intelligent use by the capitalists
of their resources and honest dealing in regard to the employees
whom they would have converted into honourable partners.

BHAI  PURUSHOTTAMDAS ,
I have your letter.  I am in a village where I propose to live till
the 30th.  I am here in connection with nature cure.
I have sent today a wire, a copy of which is enclosed.
I think, such a conference4 comes off rarely.  In your absence      
it will lack grace.  Other things can wait but this cannot, I agree     
that the date should be convenient to you.  What can we do about      
it ?  When they enquired of me on the telephone, I did not know that
the call was made in consultation with you.  I, therefore, selected the
earliest date that would suit me and conveyed it; hence the telegram.
So you have again invited cold, have you?  I shall have no
objection to your having somebody to read out your speech.  I
suggest it should be either in Gujarati or Hindustani.  It is all right, if
an English translation is prepared which you may issue to the papers.

Interview to Gandhiji”, 3-4-1946.  For Gandhiji’s account, vide “Letter of Lord
Wavell”, 6-4-1946.
2 Gandhiji, however, arrived in Delhi on April 1, in response to a special
message from Sir Stafford Cripps and Lord Pethick-Lawrence who wanted to meet him
informally before the official proceedings started.
3 This was sent by hand.
4 Presumably, a reference to the meeting of Eastern Citizenship Association of
which the addressee was Chairman.  The conference, however, could not be held as    
the Muslim League planned a sparate one.  Vide also “Letter to Vallabhbhai Patel”, 
25-3-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 133This, however, is only a suggestion.  Please do as it suits you.
Can the road along Chowpatty still accommodate large crowds?
Hasn’t all the space been built upon?  Why not in Shivaji Park?  It
seems that is the only large maidan that remains.  I would not know
much about this.
A draft of the resolution is enclosed.  You may revise the draft,
if you wish.  Your letter will reach me, if you address it to Poona.
Telegrams are delivered here.  This Uruli is on the G. I. P. railway.

It has truly been observed that all mental  and physical ailments

should be a common remedy for them too.  There is a unity of cure
as there is in disease.  The Shastras say so.  Therefore I presribed

to me this morning.  But we have a knack of explaining away the
Shastras in life when they do not suit our convenience.  We have
deluded ourselves into the belief that the Shastras are meant only for
the benefit of the soul in the life to come, that the end of dharma is to
acquire merit after death.  I do not share that view.  If dharma has no
practical use in this life, it has none for me in the next.
There is hardly anyone in this world who is completely free
from ailment whether bodily or mental.  For some of these there is no
earthly cure.  For instance, Ramanama cannot perform the miracle of
restoring to you a lost limb.  But it can perform the still greater
miracle of helping you to enjoy an ineffable peace in spite of the loss
while you live and rob death of its sting and the grave its victory at the
journey’s end.  Since death must come soon or late to everyone, why
should one worry over the time.

Correspondence continues to pour in saying that stored food
material, being declared unfit for human consumption, is thrown
away.  Skimmed milk also is thrown away for want of custom and
condensed milk is lying idle owing to ignorance. Accumulation of
food material at the ports will not mitigate distress unless it is
promptly taken to the places where it is immediately required.  Worse
than this, however, is the triple waste going on now side by side with
ever  growing famine conditions.  All such waste takes place for lack
of a living contact between the people and the rulers.

185.  HAND-WEAVING  AND  HAND-SPINNING 2
Shri Jajuji writes to say that whilst on the one hand hand-spun
yarn is piling up, on the other handloom weavers are day by day
giving up hand-spun yarn in preference to mill yarn. An appeal to the
weavers through the columns of Harijan, whether in English or in any
of the Indian languages, will be good for nothing. Hardly any weaver
reads Harijan and, if attempt is made to read it out to him, he will not
take inte-rest in it. Hence the task of speaking to the weavers on the
suicidal effect of abandoning hand-spun yarn devolves upon the
devoted heads of Charkha Sangh workers.  They have to reason out to
the weavers how they will be ultimately responsible for killing their
own occupation by excluding hand-spun yarn.  As soon as the mill-
owners can do so profitably, they will certainly stop selling mill yarn
and will weave it themselves.  They are not philanthropists.  They have
set up mills in order to make money.  They will stop selling their yarn
to handloom weavers, if they find weaving is more profitable.
Therefore it is a question of time when handloom weavers will be
starved. These are really fed by hand-spinners even as they in their
1 This appeared under “Notes”.
2 Originally written in Gujarati, this appeared as “form Harijanbandhu ”
published simultaneously with the source.136 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIturn are fed by handloom weavers.  They are twins, complementary of
each other.  This fact should be brought home to the weavers by the
Charkha Sangh.  With loving patience and knowledge they should try
to appreciate the difficulties of the weavers and learn how to remove
them. Acharya Vinoba has pointed out one remedy, namely, to
double and twist the yarn at the same time that the cones are
unwound. If this practice becomes universal, there would be no
untwisted hand-spun yarn available for weaving. It is found by
experience that twisted hand-spun yarn is any day as weavable as mill-
spun yarn, if indeed it is not more so.  Since the time of my discharge
from my last imprisonment, I have been proclaiming as vehemently as
I can that the workers should master the art of weaving as well as they
have mastered the art of spinning.  Had they not taken to spinning
themselves, they would not have solved the many difficulties of
spinners. They have now to make up for past neglect, however
unconscious it may have been, by learning the art of weaving and by
practising it assiduously.  Then and then only will they understand the
difficulties that professional weavers experience in weaving hand-spun
yarn and be able to solve them.

March 24, 1946
This is good2 , because it show that those who need nature cure
treatment are coming forward to avail themselves of it.
If the work proceeded according to plan, Gandhiji explained, he intended to
stay for at least four months in the year in their midst.  During his absence his
colleagues would continue to direct and guide them according to his instructions.  [He
said:]
The practice of nature cure does  not require high academic
quali-fications or much erudition.  Simplicity is the  essence of
universality.  Nothing that is meant for the benefit of the rich only.
But India lives in her seven lakhs of villages—obscure, tiny, out-of-
the-way villages—where the population in some cases hardly exceeds
a few hundreds, very often not even a few scores.  I would like to go
and settle down in some such village.  That is real India, my India, for
which I live.  You  cannot take to these humble people the parapher-
nalia of highly qualified doctors and hospital equipment.  In simple,
natural remedies and Ramanama lies their only hope.  
He had been told that there was hardly any disease in Uruli[-Kanchan].      
Probably what was meant was that no epidemic was prevalent, that being the      
popular conception of disease.  But, from the cases that had come to him during the
last two days, it was clear that ill-health there was in plenty in Uruli.  He told          
the villagers:
If you do as I ask you to,  Uruli will become an ideal village, to
see which people will come from far.
Man’s physical body is composed of five natural elements,  i. e.,
air, water, earth, fire or tejas (the energizing principle)  and ether
(space).  The soul quickens it.
The most essential of these is air.  Man can live without food      
for several weeks, without water  for some time, but without air he
cannot live for more than a few minutes.  God has, therefore, made air
universally available. Shortages of food or water there may be at times
but of air never.  In spite of it we foolishly deprive ourselves of God’s

2 The reference is to increase in number of patients from 30 to 43.138 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIblessings of fresh and pure air by sleeping within doors with doors
and windows shut.  One may shut the doors and windows, if he is
afraid of thieves at night. But why should one shut oneself up?
To get fresh air, one must sleep in the open.  But it is no good
sleeping in the open only to breathe dust and dirt-laden air.  The      
place where you sleep must be free from both. Some people cover
their faces as a protection against dust and cold. It is a remedy worse         
than the disease. Then there is the evil habit of breathing through      
the mouth. Mouth is the organ of ingestion. It is not the organ of
breathing. The air passing through the nasal passages is filtered        
and purified and at the same time warmed up before it  enters the       
lungs.
Anyone who fouls the air by spitting about carelessly, throwing
refuse and rubbish or otherwise dirtying the ground, sins against man   
and nature.  Man’s body is the temple of God.  Anyone who fouls the  
air that  is to enter that temple desecrates it.  He takes the name of
Rama in vain.
In the end, he warned them that they should be prepared to  find in him a hard
task-master.  If he stayed in their midst, he would neither spare himself nor them.  He
would visit their homes, inspect their streets, their drains, their kitchens, their
latrines.  He would tolerate neither dust nor dirt anywhere.

187.  WHY  BHANGI  QUARTERS? 1
Friends are puzzled over my keen desire to  reside in Bhangi
quarters in the cities or towns I may visit. To ask why I have not
entertained that desire all  these years would be more pertinent. To
answer why I did not have the desire long ago must be reserved for a
future occasion. Just now I must answer why the desire has come upon
me at all.
I have for some time been saying that we must all be Bhangis     
or untouchables. But it has worried me that I have not accorded          
the statement with corresponding action. It may not be possible           
to establish complete accordance with the wish. But it ought to be
done so far as possible. Whilst this thought was agitating me, I got the
news, which I have already shared with the readers, that in Gujarat
1 Originally written in Hindi, this appeared as “from Harijan Sevak ”  Published
simultaneously with the source.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 139only one well and one temple is shared with Harijans and this in
Karadi.1  Whether the news is true or not is immaterial here. The
material thing is the reaction produced on my mind by the news. To
be angry was madness. The news quickened the desire for residence in
untouchables’quarters. I said to myself: ‘If I lived apart from Harij-
ans, what right had I to question the action of others who went further
in their adherence to untouchability?  But whether the others changed
their mode or not was not for me to judge.  If it was my duty to reside
in Harijan quarters, I must perform it irrespective of the reaction of
the step on the others.’ This is the thought which is possessing me and
goading me to the adumbrated action.
Consequently I have asked Sheth R. D. Birla to arrange, if at all
possible, for my residence in untouchables’ quarters when I happen to
be in Bombay. I have also wired to Sheth G. D. Birla to arrange
likewise for Delhi, and Shri Brijkishen Chandiwala has already asked
for my approval of some arrangement he has made2. It goes without
saying that I must not impose myself on Harijans anywhere. I must
not wound their feelings, if they will not tolerate my presence in their
midst.  But I fear no such thing.
Incidentally I notice that some critics rejoice that I shall no
longer  reside in the Birla House.  They  do not know that I have been
accepting their hospitality for years.  I have accepted donations from
them for my many constructive activities. The critics do not know of
the  changes they have imperceptibly made in their life; nor need they
or the public in general know  these. Such changes are never made for
show.  At the same time it  is  perfectly true that there were wide
differences between them and me in outlook.   This is no cause for
sorrow or wonder.  All true change comes from within.  Any changes
brought about by pressure is worthless.  I am neither so vain nor so
foolish as to hope that all would follow me.  And who can say whether
I  am right or others in what we are doing ?  It is enough, if all of us
abide by what we consider to be right.  We are all His creatures to do
His will, not ours.  Doing so, we should all be friends to one another.

Why have I got involved in nature cure in the evening of my
life?  This question is being asked of me by several people.  Had I not
enough work on my  hands already?  Was I not too old to take up new
things?  Could anyone expect me to add to my existing burdens?  All
these are pertinent questions demanding my careful consideration.
But they did not evoke any echo within me. The still small voice
within me whispers: Why bother about what others say?  I have given
you a colleague like Dr. Dinshaw who understand you, and whom you
understand. You have confidence in your capacity, having followed
nature cure as a hobby for over half a century.  If you hide this talent
and do not make use of it, you will  be as a thief.  It will ill become
you.  Remember the teaching of the first verse of Ishopanishad  and
surrender all you have to Me.  There is nothing that really belongs to
you. Only you fancied that something was yours.  It is all Mine.   Give
it also to My creatures like the rest.  It will not in any way jeopardize
your other work provided only that you have cultivated perfect
detachment.  You have entertained the desire to live up  to 125 years.
Its fulfilment or otherwise should not be your concern.  Yours is only
to understand and do your duty and “be careful for nothing”2.
These are the thoughts that haunt me.  It  is my  third day in this
village. The number of patients who come for help is daily increasing.
They feel happy, and I feel happy in serving them.  I am receiving the
co-operation of  the local people.  I know that if I can enter the hearts
of the people here, illness will be banished and this village will become
a model of cleanliness and health.  But if this does not happen, what is
that to me?  I have only to do the behest of the Master.

have written1 to him.  If the meeting called by the League is to be held
on Sunday, and if you think it would be inadvisable for me to go
there on the same  day, please send me a wire.
Telegrams were delivered here.  We can even get a telephone
connection if we want, but why go in  for all that trouble for only six
days?
My business in naturopathy is flourishing.  I can lose nothing in
it.  And it helps to advance my other work.  If I find I have some
capital with me and do not use it, what a big fool should I be?  One
must hope to live and work for 125 years.  For the rest, God alone is
the master of life and death.  I am positive that my duty is to stay in
the Bhangi quarters.  You must get over the difficulties.

192.  NATURE  CURE  PRESCRIPTIONS-I
URULI [KANCHAN],
March 25, 1946
VITHABAI,
I would advise this.  She should take sun-bath in the nude,
followed by a hip-bath and a function-bath in cold water.  The diet
should consist of only fruit-juice and milk or butter-milk.  She may
possibly be cured,if she has faith in Rama.  If she does this much
regularly, she is sure to get better.  Complete cure is rather difficult.
HIRA
She should chew fruit and throw away the residue; take milk or
butter-milk; also hip-bath and friction-bath; mud-poultice on  the
abdomen.  This will have to be demonstrated to her; also the type of
earth and where to get it .  She should also take sun-bath.
ARJUN
Urine will pass  regularly, if he is seated in hot and cold water by
turns.  He should drink boiled water and take fruit-juices and butter-
milk for nourishment.
SALU
Is it the same trouble?  What is the use of removing cataracts
from a poor person’s eyes?  One should live with it, recite Ramanama
and, when the time is up, depart with Ramanama on one’s lips.  If this
cannot be done, she may be taken  to a  hospital and have cataractsVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 143removed.  I do not  remember any treatment for cataract.
Had she come yesterday?  She should be given sun-bath             
even in this heat so that she perspires and the boils dry up.  I feel that
she might derive some benefit, if she lies down naked with a wet towel
on her head.  While doing so—lying down—she should constantly
utter Ramanama.  She should be given all this treatment here.  We
ought to clean the boils for her and bandage.  She should be advised
about her diet.  If all this is  done here, then only she can improve.         
.  . .1 VITHU
What does he eat?  His diet should consist of milk, fruit,
vegetable and chapatis.  Sun-bath, hip-bath and friction-bath should
be taken.  His asthma can be brought under control, if he does regular
pranayama2 .
HIRUNANA
Fruit-juices for two days; then fruit-juice mixed with milk.  Sun-
bath, hip-bath and friction-bath.  If the motion is not clear, he should
try the syringe after two days.  Mud-poultices.  Tomato juice, if
tomatoes are available.
RAJU
Sun-bath, hip-bath, friction-bath.  Butter-milk and fruit-juices,
absolutely no milk; if he cannot retain  even butter-milk, then initially
only fruit-juices and boiled water.

price.  Ownership may vest in Gram Seva Mandal.  But the possession
may remain with Nayee Talim as long as it  pays vighoti 3 and an
annual rent of one rupee.  We should not hesitate to give as much land
as he wants.  After all, all work is one.  Everything is ours.  Still Gram

URULI-KANCHAN,
March 27, 1946
RESPECTED   BHAI  RANCHHODDAS,
I have your letter.  That your eyes are failing is as much a
matter for rejoicing as for sorrow.  You will not have to see thing
which pain you.  I had gathered from your previous letter that you
did not expect a reply and, therefore, because of heavy pressure of
other work I did not  reply to it.  Since you want a reply to the present
letter, I am dictating this after the morning prayer.  My eyes are still
good enough, but the hand needs rest.  I, therefore, spare it other
exertion so as to be able to write for Harijan.
If your interpretation of ahimsa is correct,what could I achieve
by living up to 125?  For India would have to bear the load of my
ignorance for about 50 years more still.  However, so long as my
ignorance seems to me to be knowledge, may I  not hope to live up to
125 and go on serving up to the end?  You say, moreover, that ahimsa
will work in dealing with friends, but not in dealing with enemies who
do not believe in it; and, in support of you argument, you cite the
example of Rajputs and stories from the Puranas.  Let us, for the
moment, leave aside the examples.  If ahimsa was limited to loving
those who love us, how  could it be described as the supreme dharma?
Even dacoits and robbers do that. How great was the love of Alibaba’s
forty robbers for one another?  Does not the aphorism1 describing
the distinguishing characteristics of ahimsa say that in the presence of
ahimsa all ill-will subsides?  If this is true, ahimsa can be tested only
against an enemy.  Does not the well-known couplet2  of Shamaldas,
“For a bowl of water give a goodly meal,” [etc.], teach the same
lesson in simple but sweet words?  The bravery of the Rajputs cannot
be denied.  If nothing could ever be achieved through violence, would
it have acquired the powerful spell that it has?  Are the successes of
falsehood, too, any the less impressive? We often see falsehood occu-
pying seats of power and truth wandering in rags, but are you
impressed by this fact?  And what do the  Puranas, etc., suggest, if not
that God alone may do as He wills? He who creates may destroy, for
even through destruction He creates. Prahlada  and others displayed

father, but did not give up Rama’s name till the last.
What more need I write?  I do not  wish to drown myself in the
well of the Shastras.  They seem to me like the great oceans, full of
countless alligators.  But do they not contain pearls, too?   Let us,
therefore, churn them to find that nectar in the form of the pearls.
I hope you will not mind your younger brother indulging in
such philosophizing.  Won’t you forgive him?  Do dictate letters to
me whenever you get time.   Paramanand did call on me and also gave
the book he has written.

Bapu wired approval and also sent detailed letter yesterday to Brijkishan.
As regards telephone and electricty, Bapu says that he does not mind if they
can be installed without much difficulty; but their absence won’t make any difference
in regard to his plans.  In case electricity is installed for lighting, he expects that the
arragements will be permanent.  If the wires are removed the moment he goes out of
the Bhangi Nivas, the whole thing will become a force.  There should be some
permanent improvement in the Bhangi Nivas as a result of his stay there.  In
connection with this, Bapu is very particular about plentiful supply of clean water for
bath and drinking.  You are to make arrangements for a bath tub for him too.  So much
for the present.  More when we meet.

were disgraceful enough if and where they happened. I say ‘if’
because whilst I have known of some, I have no knowledge of all that
you have described. But to give them all-India publicity in the
columns of Harijan is to exaggerate the evil out of all proportion. To
advertise an evil is to give it a fresh lease of life. Wisdom, therefore,

4 Gandhiji uses the English word.150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdictates dignified silence and a determination to prepare to face
manfully a repetition.
There are Anglo-Indians who are ashamed of their Indian
parentage and will have nothing to do with Indians. These excite
prejudice and when feelings run high come in for exhibition of such
prejudice resulting even in disgraceful incidents you have described.
Living in the midst of a population which numerically reaches nine
figures, regrettable incidents will sometimes happen. Times of peace
should be devoted [to] think[ing] out ways and means of avoiding the
re-eruption. One that occurs to me is that Anglo-Indians should cease
to think of themselves as separate people requiring special privileges.
These they will not, and should not, enjoy in independent India.
Indeed, nobody should have special privileges. All over the world
theyhave been the bane of foreign rule which is evil itself. It must
breed evil and exist on that breed.
There are Indians who have adopted European manners and
customs and conduct themselves as superiors, much to the discomfort
of their fellow-men. I know that before now even these have come in
for the ill-treatment to which you have drawn my attention, How nice
it would be if all these ugly features of society were removed even
before independence becomes the order of the day in law and in fact !

URULI-KANCHAN,
March 28, 1946
BHAI  MUNSHI,
I have your letter about Kamlesh.  I see that you have had the
same experience that I had.  In these circumstances I don’t think I can
give him the work of Hindustani Harijan.
Dr.  Sharma is a naturopath.  We have bought some land  for
him near Khurja Road and set up a Trust for the same . The trustees
are Sheth Lakshminarayan Gadodia and Jajuji. A difference has arisenVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 151between Gadodiaji and Sharma regarding the latter’s fee1 .  In itself
the dispute is about nothing very important. But it involves determin-
ation of the truth or otherwise of the facts.  They have entrusted that
task to me.  But I cannot undertake it because I myself am deeply
involved in the affair.  Moreover, if I have to decide the dispute, I
would have to go into the minutest details.  I am not in a position to
do so.  I am busy with so many things that if I started giving my time
to individual cases, I would not be able to do justice to the public tasks
I have taken up.  I am therefore, getting out of all such involvements,
and so wish to put this burden on you.
Actually you should be offered a fee for this work.  But I am
not in a position to ensure that.  Godadiaji can pay the fee, but he has
agreed to be  a trustee in this venture for love of public service and,
since I myself am involved in the affair, I cannot ask him to pay you
any fee.  And Dr. Sharma is in no position to pay the fee.  Hence I
must entrust this task to you purely as a form of public service as I
have entrusted to many others.
What I am thinking is that Sharma may give a statement setting
out this case, then Gadodiaji may  do the same, and Sharma may reply
to his statement.  You may then, if you wish, meet both  or call either;
otherwise you may decide on the basis of the statements themeselves.
I think this will not involve much work.
If you express your inability to undertake the work in the
condi-tions I have explained, I will not take it ill.  Nobody should
consider whether I  would be pleased or displeased in any matter
connected with my personal work, for I think I have, or rather God
has, dulled all such feelings in me.  If that were not so, I would be
crushed under the weight that I bear, and would have to give up my
aspiration to live up to 125.
If you feel that you can decide this matter, it will be necessary to
draw up some kind of a rough agreement authorizing you to do so.  I
will get it drawn up and signed by the parties or will do as you wish.
I am arriving there on the 31st. I will be staying in some  
Harijan quarters. I had forgotten that Lilavati2 was the President

205.  IMPLICATIONS  OF  ‘QUIT  INDIA’
In terms of non-violence, ‘Quit India’ is a healthy, potent cry of
the soul.  It is not a slogan.  It means the end, through means purely
truthful and non-violent, of foreign rule and domination.  It does not
mean foreigner’s destruction but his willing conversion to Indian life.
In this scheme, there is no  room for  hatred of the foreigner.  He is a
man, even as we are.  It is fear of him that gives rise to harted.  Fear
gone, there can be no hatred.
Thus his conversion implies our conversion too. If we cease to
be inferiors, he cannot be our superior.  His arsenals  and his weapons,
typified in their extreme in the atom bomb, should have no terror for
us.  It follows that we may not covet them.  We often make the mistake
of thinking that  we must first have things before we cease  to covet
them. This tempting argument leads to the prolongation of the agony.
Must I do all the evil I can, before I learn to shun it?  Is it not enough
to know the evil to shun it?  If not, we should be sincere enough to
admit that we love  evil too well to give it up.
Let us assume that foreign rule is ended. What should the
foreigner do? He could hardly be considered free when he was
protected by British arms. As a free man he will discover that it was
wrong to possess privileges which the millions of India could not
enjoy.  He will live doing his duty as behoves a son of India.  He will
no longer live at India’s expense.  On the contrary, he will give India
all his talents and by his services render himself indispensable to the
land of his adoption.
If this is true of the European, how much more true must                 
it be for those Anglo-Indians and others who have adopted Europen
manners and customs in order to be classed as Europeans demanding
1 Gandhiji, however, says “Tulsidas”.
2 ibid154 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIpreferential   treatment?  All   such   people   will find themselves ill at
ease, if they expect continuation of the favoured treatment hitherto
enjoyed by them.
They should rather feel thankful that they will be disburdened
of preferential treatment to which they had no right by any known
canon of reasoning, and which was derogatory to their dignity.
We have all—rulers and ruled—been living so long in a
stifling,unnatural atmosphere that we might well feel in the beginning
that we have lost the lungs for breathing the invigorating ozone of
freedom.  If the reality comes in an orderly, that is, a non-violent
manner, because the parties feel that it is right, it will be a revealing
lesson for the world.
URULI [-KANCHAN], March 29, 1946
Harijan, 7-4-1946
206.  SPEECH   AT  KASTURBA  GANDHI  NATIONAL
MEMORIAL  TRUST  WOMEN  AGENTS’ MEETING,  URULI-
KANCHAN1
[On or after March 28, 1946 ]2
Tracing his line of thought, Gandhiji explained how it was women’s work, and
how he had felt he must make women shoulder the responsibility of it.  In no other
organization, not even in the Congress, had such a tremendous responsibility been
thrown on women.
The Agent’s post throws all the burden of work on her area.  It is immense but
given the industry and intelligence not only will the work grow but the Agent herself
will grow in stature.  She is there to serve and to give, not to possess.  By this giving
she will become the people’s trusted servant.  This is the royal road to democracy.
Gandhiji gave them a clear answer in respect to political work such as
volunteering at polling booths.  They were not there for that purpose.  It was          
perfectly possible for them not to be in the Congress and yet be of it as he                   
was himself.  The work before them was to make women fit to take their                               
1 This is extracted from Amrit Kaur’s “Inspiring for Women”.  Amrit Kaur,
explains: “Uruli village. .  . was the meeting place of all the women Agents so far
appointed by the Kasturba Trust to organize and supervise work in the different
Provinces. .  . When Thakkar Bapa suggested to Gandhiji that an Agents’ meeting
would be advisable, Gandhiji who talked of democracy should have been party to the
appointment of single persons to run the work of Province instead of the originally
formed committees.”
2 Vide “Kasturba Smark Trust”, 7-4-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 155place in society.  If they  succeeded in teaching them the correct way of life, they
would have taught them all they needed.  Today they were steeped in the Stygian
darkness of ignorance and superstition.  With the removal of that, women would make
freedom worth while.
He cited the good example of Kanu Gandhi who had said that in his camp, soon
to be started, it would be his aim to teach the students how to battle against famine by
tilling the ground, scavenging, cooking, bringing their own expenses with them, so
that they need not be a liability on anyone.  Women have to work in famine areas
with this ideal.  It is ours to  mitigate, not to aggravate the burden.
Asked as to what work he would lay most emphasis on, so far as women were
concerned, Gandhiji felt that sanitation and hygiene, owing to the lack of knowledge
of which our people suffered so greatly, should take first place.  Then there were evil
customs which had to go, the useless expenditure on jewellary; and he made everyone
laugh by his graphic description of a much bejewelled woman patient with a huge
nose ring, earring-necklace, bracelets and anklets complete who had visited him as a
patient that very morning!  It was hard to know what should come first.  “Really all
work in its own place is of equal importance.”  There is the very great necessity of
teaching women the care and upbringing of children, discipline in their own lives in
every department including eating.  He placed maternity almost last in comparison
with the above mentioned.  But nothing could be achieved without friendship with the
women.  That was the first and basic desideratum.
The pay of workers had caused much discussion.  For Gandhiji it was the spirit
of the worker that meant everything.  Inasmuch as the labourer was worthy of his
hire, a decent  living wage must be paid; but it was the work and not the pay that
should attract.
Were the women to be given the wheel as a revolutionary weapon as, he had
said it was, in the  hands of a Jawaharlal?  The answer was ‘No’  How could it be such
in the hands of an ignorant woman? But if every women in India span, then a silent
revolution would certainly be created of which a Jawaharlal could make full use.
Unless steam generated was put to proper use, the engine would not run and the person
generating the steam might himself be scalded by it even unto death.
Amongst the members were some staunch femininists who were anxious for
women alone to run the show.  To them Gandhiji  said that the men who were there
were serving the memory of one who was instinctively a villlage woman.  Long
before he himself had taken to village life as being the ideal life for service, Kasturba
has shown her preference for it.  Her heart was in Phoenix even in the far off South
African days when he himself worked in a town.  The men who were honouring her
memory were only serving until such time as women were ready to take their place.156 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII am the only one whom you may find it hard to get rid of, for I
have always counted myself as a woman.  I believe, I know your sex
and your needs better than you do yourselves.
He said, the Kasturba Trust would have even a bigger place in national service
when freedom was ours than it today.  For all would go to the winds, if women were
not properly trained.  He hoped that every worker in the Trust would have a great deal
to give to the new government.
But we have got to generate that strength within us.  We may not be frightened
of making mistakes.  Man is born to make mistakes, but the great thing is  to see our
mistakes and learn from them.   We should magnify our own errors so as to be deterred
from falling into them again.  Those who imagine that they never make mistakes are
to be feared.
He agreed with one of the members when she said that it was a
great tragedy that the uplift of women had to be an item on the
constructive programme.“Have we yet to find ourselves ?” she asked.
The reply was: Yes, indeed, and to where better can you find yours-
elves than by being true to the highest traditions of Indian women by
serving your unhappy sisters today?1
One worker asked that while he did not advocate their taking any part in
politics, what would  he advise them to do in case of violent oubreaks?
There is no question of any of you keeping aloof from the fiery
furnance, should such ever come your way.  I shall not shed a tear ; I
shall rejoice to hear, if any or all of you are found to have laid down
your lives in tying to quell the disturbance.  To be killed but never to
kill is the law that govern us, and women should surely excel in this
field.

URULI[-KANCHAN],
[On or before] March [30,] 1 1946   
SUBHADRABAI (the female child’s mother)    
Does she pass stools?  She should keep the girl in the sun after
covering her head; mud-poultice on the stomach. The girl should be
given mosambi-juice. She should seat the girl on a stool in lukewarm
water.  This will be enough  to ensure  a clear motion.  If she does not
have a clean motion in spite of all this, she should be treated with the
syringe.  But then all this is for you people to do.
PARU (girl)
Sun-bath, hip-bath, friction-bath.  Only boiled water and butter-
milk to drink.  Mud-poultices.
MANU (girl)
Sun-bath, steam-bath, cold water bath, mud-pouitices.  Milk and
fruit-juice mixture for diet.
SADASHIV
May take tomato-juice besides that milk, and nothing else.  Sun-
bath, hip-bath and friction-bath.
Now the rest may come tomorrow so that we can give the
patients the baths.
AJI (girl)
Fruit-juices, sun-bath, hip-bath and friction-bath.  Her clothes
are very dirty.
KONDIBA/DHONDIBA
The most effective treatment for rickets is sun-bath and taking
milk mixed with  fruit-juices.
SHRIPAD
He must get himself admitted to the hospital.  If he is willing
1 Gandhiji left Uruli-Kanchan on this date.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 159and wants to have a note, he may go with one.  There is no other
remedy for hernia. A strap-belt can also be worn.  If he does not want
to do all this, he should surrender to Rama and rest content.
PARVATI
Only mosambi-juice.  Hip-bath and friction-bath; mud-pack on
the abdomenn, regular sun-bath.  If she does  this much, she is bound
to recover.  In any case she should realize the greatness of Ramanama.
JAI  (or) . .  .1
Advised to take light sun-bath for some minute, then in the
shade and then again in the sun.  She should do this  for an hour.  She
should be given fruit-juices mixed with water.  The water should be
boiled.  She should be regularly bathed to keep her clean.  
SADASHIV
Advised to take milk mixed with fruit-juices.  Sun-bath only in
the nude; the head must always be covered.  Banana or papaya leave
can also be put on the head.2
Should sit in the sun until he perspires.  Does he take the baths?
When he feels very hot after sitting in the sun, he should wipe his
body with a clean piece of cloth soaked in cold water.
Today he should also be shown how to take a hip-bath.
Yes, we should keep him in the sun.  He is to be given hip-bath.
He is also to be given hip-bath.
Can he see at the moment?  If he takes a diet free from chillies,
takes fruit, and hip-bath and friction-bath, he is likely to be all       
right.
Does he pass stools?  What is he fed?  How come, breast-feeding
at this age?  How old is he?  How can a two year old child be allowed
to suckle?  He should be given only fruit-juice.  He needs an enema,   
which can be done only here.  Make the neccessary arrangements.
Joshi should see to all this.  And both of them should be given hip-
bath. The girl is very dirty.  She should take friction-bath and sit in
the sun reciting Ramanama.
How many old patients are there?  How many of them were
asked yesterday to take the baths?  They should be given the baths.
The girls are as good as women.  They must be treated by Prabhavati

complaint?  What has she tied to her abdomen?  In the first place she
should not  gird up so tight.  She should lie prostrate and naked in a
solitary place.  She should give up eating bread, and subsist on milk
and fruit.  Does she pass stools?  What does she do?  With whom has
she come?  Does she have anyone at home?
I hope we have a measure.
In that case you should examine closely.  Send Dhirubhai for
the message.
Send for Dhirubhai also.
All this should be recorded.  Ask him what his name is and what
his complaint is.  What does he eat?  Then ask him  to lie down in the
sun completly nude.  He should take fruit-juice only; he should sit in
hot water and then in cool water and should continue this practise till
he feels better.  If he does not pass stool regularly, he should be
treated with the syringe.  For this, we shall send somebody to his
place.  If he will do this much regularly, the disease would be cured
and then he should practise repetition of Ramanama with faith.

212.  QUESTION  BOX
Q.Horse racing is going on in many important cities.  It is
alike a lure for high and low, rich  and poor, and it leads to moral
degradation and, in some cases, penury.  Many Princes spend lakhs of
their people’s money on buying race horses.  What steps should our
new government take to check this evil?
A.There is no doubt whatsoever about the evil. The good it is
supposed to do is extremely doubtful. And, at this time of growing
distress in the country, it is criminal. The new national government
can  do a great deal to check the evil. But let us recognize their limita-
tions.  Being popular, i. e., people’s governments, they will never be
able to go far in advance of popular opinion. That is specially a
function belonging to reformers. But these governments can certainly,
by their own example, rob the evil of the stamp of fashion that the
bureaucracy has set upon it even to the point of wasting public money
on the luxury.  The Princes will copy the example of good manners
that the national governments may set.
Q.We find that the Congress is reluctant to select women
representatives on a large scale for elective bodies.  It is surely just and
necessary that more women are taken into the various bodies.  How
would you deal with the question?
A. I am not enamoured of equality or  any other proportion in      162 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsuch matters.  Merit should be the only test.  Seeing, however, that it     
has been the custom to decry women, the contrary custom should be
to prefer women, merit being equal, to men even if the preference
should result in men being entirely displaced by  women.  It would be
a dangerous thing to insist on membership on the ground merely of
sex.  Women and for that matter any group should disdain patronage.
They should seek justice, never favour.Therefore the proper thing is
for women as indeed for men to advance the  spread not of English or
Western education among them, but such education on general lines
through their provincial languages as will fit them for the numerous
duties of citizenship.  For men to take a lead in this much-needed
reform would be not a matter of favour but a  simple act of belated
justice due  to women.

213.  HINDUSTANI1
I have no doubt in my mind that Hindustani, i. e., a correct
mixture of Hindi and Urdu, is the national language.  But I have not                     
yet been able to prove this in my own writings or speech.  Let not
readers of Harijan Sevak , however, be irritated.  Perhaps it is as well                    
that the attempt to create a national language has come into the          
hands of an inadept.  After all the general mass of people come in        
this category.  It will be through the efforts of all such that linguistic
pundits will be enabled to create the proper mixture, easily understood
by all.  If readers of Harijan Sevak  will keep on pointing out mistakes
in language, it will help the journal to create and maintain a proper
style.  It will be the aim of Harijan Sevak  to make its language sweet
to the  ear and easily understandable to every Indian.  A language   
which   is  not generally understood  is useless. It is unreal, if it cannot
serve its purpose.  All attempts at having a forced language have
proved futile.

Some years ago it was announced2 in the newspapers that
Subhas Chandra Bose had died.  I believed the report.  Later the news
was proved to have been incorrect.  Since then I  have had a feeling
that Netaji could not leave us until  his dream of swaraj had been
fulfilled.  To lend strength to this feeling was the knowledge of
Netaaji’s great ability to hoodwink his enemies and even the world for
the sake of his cherished goal.  These were the only reasons for my
belief that he  was alive.
I have not the ability for foretelling the future.  I have no
strength except what comes from insistence on truth.  Non-violence
too springs from the same insistence.  God alone knows absolute
truth.  Therefore I have often said, Truth is God.  It  follows that man,
a finite being, cannot know absolute truth.  Therefore I had nothing
but my instinct to tell me that Netaji was alive.  No reliance can  be
placed on such unsupported feeling.
On the other hand, there is strong evidence to counteract the
feeling.  The British Government is party to  that evidence.  Capt.
Habibur Rahman has said,  he was present at the time of Netaji’s death
and has brought back his charred wrist watch. Another of his
companions, Shri Iyer, met and told me that my instinct was wrong
and I should abandon the feeling that Subhas Chandra was alive.  In
the face of these proofs I  appeal to everyone to forget what  I have
said3 and, believing in the evidence before them, reconcile themselves
to the  fact that Nataji has left us.  All man’s ingenuity is as nothing
before the might of the One God.  He alone is Truth and nothing else
stands.

I got your letter.
The mistake is grave enough.  How can such work be assigned
to the poor labourers?  If they pay the fine, understanding its
implication, you should accept it.  But then it ceases to be a fine.  We
will not be benefited, if they pay it per force.  Tell them that, if they
do it again, they  will have to go.  Take what I say as a suggestion
from me, and do what you all think reasonable.  Do not exert yourself
beyond your strength.
You may, if you want, ask for money from home. I find nothing
wrong in it.  But you are not duty bound to do so.  In this matter, too,
do what you think your dharma is.  We shall improve only by making
mistakes.
Have you seen what Bhansali says?  Ask him.  See the enclosed

216. SPEECH  AT  PRAYER   MEETING,  URULI-KANCHAN
May 30, 1946
Before his departure from Uruli, Mahatma Gandhi exhorted the villagers            
of Uruli to lead a clean, healthy life and turn the village into a model village. He also
stressed the importance of spinning, and advised the villagers to take it.
He referred to his activities in the villlage during his nine days’ stay there and
hoped that the villagers would follow the instructions he had given them.2
The Bombay Chronicle, 31-3-1946
1 Pushpa N. Naik
2 The report concluded: “The public of Uruli promised Gandhiji a sum of Rs.
10,000 for opening a nature cure clinic in their village. . .  . A complement of three
doctors and assistants was stationed at Uruli under Gandhiji’s instruction to carry on
the work.”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 165 217.  KASTURBA  SMARAK  TRUST
There were two  meetings at Uruli-Kanchan: on the 28th, 29th
and 30th March; one of the Agents1 of this Trust and the other of the
Executive.  The meeting of the Agents was the first of its kind.  The
Agents had many interesting questions.  Why could not the Agents      
be members of the legislatures?  The obvious answer is that, if they      
are to do justice to their work,  they should have no time for legis-   
lative duties.  The decisive reason is that the villagers will have a  
wrong example set to them,if they  have members of legislatures to   
look up to.
Whatever the  sphere of work they choose, they should not be
non-entities.  It should be remembered that the Agents have displaced
the committees that were appointed for the last year.  If they cover the
whole Province, they have their work cut out from them.  If they
cannot cope with it, they have to run model shibirs 2 in one or more
places to prepare women workers for villages.  These may be teachers,
nurses, spinners, weavers, sanitarians, etc.  Work by women among
women in the villages of India is an unbeaten track.  Men are hardly
fit for it. But the women have so long remained without experiences
of such work that it is difficult, especially in the initial stages.  If the
Agent attempt at intensity and confine their activity to certain centres,
they will find the work to be simple and instructive.
Then they have their advisers.  They are not meant to be
ornamental.  Their advice should always be at the disposal of the
Agents. If they are well-chosen, they must prove towers of strength to
the Agents in their  difficult task.
The experiment of having women only as Agents is new.           
It can only succeed if they are wisely guided by the Centre and           
ably advised by the advisers.  Much as it is to be wished that they too
were women, the fear is that in the beginning they will be mostly men.
The advisers should never aspire to be more than such and never be
less.  It should never aspire to be more than such and never be less.  It
shoud be their proud privilege to give the Agents their advice
whenever it is sought.  The members of the defunct committee, it is
1 Vide “Speech at Kasturba Gandhi Nsational Memorial Trust Women Agents’
Meeting, Uruli-Kanchan”, 28-3-1946
2 Camps166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhoped, will never feel that they have been displaced for any other
reason save the patent and potent one of manning the organization
with women from top to bottom.  The secret of success in this as in
any other organization lies in the spirit of service actuating its every
limb and self being subordinated to the organization.

218.  TEN  SUGGESTIONS  WORTH  CONSIDERING
A worker has made some suggestions for meeting the threatened
calamity.  I give them below with only some minor changes.  Possibly
some of the suggestions might have been made earlier in one form or
the other.  I  have not taken that into consideration.  The best of
suggestion can be misused by a dishonest person.  Let us hope that
the scorching heat of the Holi fire will burn out the impurities in all of
us.
1.There should be a strict and impartial machinery to prevent
the  removal of even a single grain or a blade of grass unless enough
stock of foodgrains and fodder is reserved for the requirement of the
entire rural population including the cattle and livestock for the whole
year.
2.There should be no difference between the purchase and the
sale prices of foodgrains.  The sale prices should be kept on par with
the purchase prices.  The overhead charges should be borne by the
Government alone.
3.Foodgrains should be made easily available in every locality
at controlled prices.  There should be no need for futile treks of five
to seven miles and returning  with empty hands as at present.
4.Arrangements should be made to provide work according to
one’s capacity and to pay remuneration in the form of foodgrains
and or clothes as the case may be to those who do not have neccessary
cash to purchase them.
5.The pay of all categories of low-paid employees should be
raised to meet the cost of living without waiting for  any demands or
agitations, but payment may be made in the form of food-grains.
6.Items of current expenditure in the budget should be
pruned to provide sustenance to the people.  Cuts in the salaries of
highly paid official should be introduced, if neccessary.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 1677.The post-war scheme or other such projects could be easily
suspended till the crisis blows over.
8. It should be so planned that public donations flow into a
central pool from where they are canalized for combating starvation
and also for increasing food production.
9.It should be considered the sacred duty of a Government to
strive sincerely to provide livelihood to the people in some form or
the other.
10.Eating-houses or meal-counters should be introduced
where a person without any discrimination of caste and creed can get
a meal at the lowest cost or by offering some sort of labour instead.

I have read your letter.  I do not think you can do after a month
what you are unable to do today.  And what is that—whether you two
can live together without seeking sexual pleasure?  If you cannot, it
means you do hanker after it in your mind, and doing that while
refraining from physical gratification can do harm.
It is for your own sake that I have not given you specific work.
Your letter itself shows that you are not  ready for such work.  But
you know well enough that there is work you can do.  Go through all
[the language edition of] Harijan carefully and note the errors in the
copies themselves. Also translate the English articles into Hindutani
and show me; and the Gujarati into Hindustani. Master the Urdu
script. Have you done any of these things?  If not, why not?  But
never mind that; correct your error and start again.  Do whichever of
the things mentioned above you have failed to do.
Start working instead of thinking.  From that you will learn the
art of thinking.1

I went through Subbalakshmi’s5 letter.  It is  a nice letter,          
and I am returning it. Write to  her that the appointment of an-         
other woman as Agent6 should not stop her from doing her own      
work. Only one person could be Agent, whereas there could be
thousands of workers. Since this is a new experiment, she should
utilize her intelligence as well as her other qualities as much as she
can.  That will show her real zest.  Let her train the girls as she pleases.
1 The letter is written on a note dated April 1, 1946, by the addressee in which

You have been appointed Agent.  It will be your duty to meet

that your advisory committee should be composed of men only, you
can take women as well.  The committee should be competent to
advice you.  It is not necessary that there must be ten members; you
can have  a smaller number.   To be  in harmony  with all is a sign of

231.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  NEW  DELHI2
April 1, 1946
Untouchability is  the blackest spot  on Hinduism, and the
sooner it  is wiped out the better.  I  have of late been saying that the
Hindus have to become Ati Shudras not merely in name but in
thought, word and deed.   For that token scavenging is not enough.  I
have, therefore, decided that  I must go and actually live among
Harijans in Harijan quarters.
I, however, do not delude myself with the belief  that by staying
here I am sharing the actual life with the Harijans.  I have seen some
Harijan quarters, and squalor, the dirt and the filth in the midst of
which the Harijans live. I know too that this place has been brightened
1 The source, however, has “March”.
2 The speech is extracted from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter”.  According to a
report in The Bombay Chronicle , 2-4-1946, from which the opening sentence is
reproduced, the meeting was held in the Valmiki Temple compound adjoining
Gandhiji’s residence in Harijan Colony. Among those present was Sir Stafford
Cripps, who occupied a chair on the dais, and he accompanied Gandhiji to his room at
the end of the prayers.174 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIup.  Indeed I feel embarassed by the amenities that have been
provided here by Seth Birla for me and my party.  My coming to stay
here,  I hope, is my first step, not the last.  It is my constant prayer,
and I look forward to the day, when I would actually go and stay in a
Harijan hut and partake of the food they may provide me there.  In
the mean time, it gives me some satisfaction to be able to live in this
dharmashala surrounded by Harijan dwellings on all sides.
How can I feel angry with them?1  I can quite understand their
pent up resentment at the way in which they have been treated by the
so-called Savarnas .  They might even want to wreak vengeance.
There is such a glaring contradiction between our profession       
and practice. They have a right to feel impatient. I can only         
plead with them to bear with the Hindu society.  An age-old evil   
cannot be eradicated in a day, I know; it has to go or Hinduism          
must perish. In the mean time the least expiation that we can          
make is to share with the Harijans their disabilities and to deny
ourselves the privilege which the latter cannot share. The present
conditions under which they live should be intolerable even for a day
to a decent-minded person.  I pray for the time when the condition of
life, as regards sanitation, cleanliness, etc., in Harijan quarters will be
such that even a person like myself might he able to go and stay there
without any  compunction.
Gandhiji appealed that no one should come to the prayer gatherings merely for
the sake of darshan.  Only those should come who were earnnest about prayer.2

233.  INTERVIEW  TO  SOUTH  AFRICAN  DELEGATION1
  DELHI,
[After April 1, 1946 ]2
Gandhiji remarked on the presence of divisions among them.  They admitted
divisions but argued that they were there even in Gandhiji’s time.
GANDHIJI:   The difference between then and now is this: that in
those days the black-legs became isolated after a time, and it was
possible to hold monster meetings everywhere.  Parsi Rustomji went
among the indentured labourers and, in the final struggle, they rose
like one man.  Repeat that history today, and you will win.  Do not
repeat it, and you  will fail.  Do you command the sympathy and
support of all the interests?  Will the mercantile community back you?
SORABJI:   The mercantile community was  not with us even then.
But we had Cachalia3 .  If you have one Cachalia amongst  you,
the whole of the merchantile community will be covered.
S.   Suppose no merchant comes forward.  Is not a struggle
possible then?
G. It will then take a different turn and in the end the mercantile
community will be swept out of existence.
A MEMBER:    We are a difficult community at times.
ANOTHER MEMBER:   And quarrelsome too.  
G.  I know, I know.  The South Africa of today is not far
different from the South Africa that I have known.  In the first article                     
1 This appeared under the title “With the South African Delegation”. by
Pyarelal, who  explain that the deputationists headed by Sorabji Rustomji, son of
Parsi Rustomji who was a leading merchant of Natal and close associate of Gandhiji,
“sought Gandhiji’s advice for the starting of successful satyagraha”.
2 Accroding to Pyarelal, the delegation met Gandhiji in Harijan Colony where
he arrived on April 1, 1946.
3 A. M. Cachalia176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII wrote for the Indian Opinion I said that if after all there was              
one true man in South Africa, he will cover all. He will build              
up the whole structure from within. ‘Amidst a whole heap of bad   
coins’, I wrote, ‘If there is one true sovereign, the heap will be        
worth that one sovereign and no more.’ If you produce one civil
resister of merit, he will pull things through.  Do not start the struggle,
therefore, unless you have that stuff. Manage to exist you will
anyhow.  But that should not satisfy you. You have to live as a self-
respecting community with an equal status. Indians have to make
good that position by showing the real stuff.
The discussion then turned on the strategy of the proposed satyagraha.
Gandhiji was definitely opposed to sitting in prohibited seats in trains and railway
carriages by way of satyaraha.  Satyagraha should be on a clear, unequivocal and
impersonal issue and capable of taking thousands in its fold. . . .
Gandhiji mentioned how he had refused to send a measage for a meeting of the
West Africa Federation that was held some time back in London, because they
conceived of a struggle after the way of Europe.  He added:
Probably theirs is not the way of non-violence. One day the
black races will rise  like the avenging Attila against their white
oppressors, unless someone presents to them the wepon of satyagraha.
A MEMBER :  You have said, we should associate with Zulus and
Bantus.  Does it  not mean joining them in a common anti-white
front? 
GANDHIJI:   Yes, I have said that we should associate with Zulus,
Bantus, etc. It means that you take them under your wing when you
have developed that power of non-violence.  It will be good, if you
fire them with the spirit of non-violence. You will be their saviour. But
if you allow yourselves to be overwhelmed and swept off your feet, it
will be their and your ruin.  Their slogan today is no longer merely
‘Asia for the Asiatics’ or ‘Africa for the Africans’ but the unity of all
the exploited races of the earth. On India rests the burden of pointing
the way to all the exploited races. She won’t be able to bear that
burden today, if non-vio-lence does not permeate us more than [what
it is] today.  I have been try-ing to fit ourselves for that mission by
giving a wider bend to our  strug-gle.  India will become a torch-
bearer to the oppressed and exploited races, only if she can vindicate
the principle of non-violence in her own case, not jettison it as soon as
independence of foreign control is achieved.
ANOTHER MEMBER :   Race consciousness is arising all over  South Afria.  WeVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 177Indians take advantage of the Bantus.  We send our children to Native colleges.  But
we are ashamed to call ourselves Natives.  They feel we are arrogant and aloof.  We do
not do enough to make an adequate return for what we have got from them. They are
getting resentful and the white man encourages and promotes that feeling to widen the
gulf.
G.  It will be an evil day for you, if he succeeds.  The trouble is
that you are all worshippers of the golden calf.
Christopher:  Having never seen it, how can we worship it?
G   Worshipping is  different from  seeing.  Don’t we worship
God without seeing Him?
The delegation then asked, if a leader could be sent from India to organize and
lead them.
Gandhiji, in  reply, told them that a leader would have to arise from among
them.  He hoped that they would throw up  one in due time.  He described to them how
he had been arguing with his son Manilal to train up his children for the task.  After
they had finished their education in India,  he hoped, they would go back and settle
down in South Africa and serve the Indian comminity.  Apropos the training that
would equip South Africa born Indian children for service, he mentioned how he had
refused to send his own children to Loveday and Fort Hare.

234.  LETTER  TO  LORD  PETHICK-LAWRENCE
VALMIKI  MANDIR,  READING  ROAD,
NEW  DELHI,
April 2, 1946
DEAR  LORD  LAWRENCE,
Our mutual friend Sudhir Ghosh tells me1 that you would like
me to reduce to writing the points I told him to discuss informally
with you and Sir Stafford.      
One is universal among all independence-minded people, as
distinguished from the dumb millions, whether Congressmen or other.
It is the immediate release of political prisoners irrespective of the
charge of violence or non-violence.  They cannot be a danger to the
State now that the necessity for independence has become common
cause. It seems to be ridiculous to  keep, say Shri Jayaprakash
Narayan and Dr. Lohia, both learned and cultured men of whom any
1Vide footnote 2, “Letter to Sir Frederick Burrows”, 22-3-1946178 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsociety would be proud, nor is there any occasion for treating any
person as an underground worker.  To leave the question of discharge
for disposal by the incoming national government would be a step no
one will understand or appreciate.  Independence will lose its grace.
The other  affects the masses. I  refer to the salt tax.  As a means
of raising revenue, it is insignificant. As a means of harassing                     
the masses, it is a measure of  which  the mischief is  indescribable.    
The masses will hardly appreciate independence, if the burden of the    
salt monopoly continues to affect  them. I must not weary you with
argument. I mention the two measures as a preparation of  the Indian
mind for independence.  They will produce a psychological effect.
I may mention that I discussed both the measures in a different
setting with Mr.  Casey1 , and I am now in correspondence with the
present Governor of Bengal.  I may add that I  have today heard from
Mr. Abell in regard  to the salt tax that “the Government do not find
themselves able to accept the  suggestion.”2

We are ourselves responsible for the creation of this problem.     
We did not know the science of khadi.  We do not know it fully       
even now.  Therefore, like children, we stumble again and again and
thereby learn to  walk.  In order that we may not fall so as never  to
rise again, we made use of a go-cart  and are still using it.  Having
realized this, the A. I. S. A. has to make a  tremendous effort to
vindicate its existence or else be wiped out.  By A. I. S. A. is meant all
its workers and includes even the spinners.  It must be borne in mind
that to make the spinners self-reliant and through their activity to

3 Originally written in Gujarati, this appeared as “from Harijanbandhu”
published simultaneously with the source.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 179achieve India’s freedom is, and ought to be, the Association’s goal.
That we may not reach that goal should not cause undue worry.  It is
enough for us to know that it is  the correct goal and, having started
the activity,  we have to correct our mistakes and go forward. That is
the essence of the scientific method.  No science has  dropped from
the skies in a perfect form.  All sciences develop and are built up
through experience. Perfection is not an attribute of science.
Absolute perfection is not possible either for man or for the  science
that he creates.  For example, astronomy is continually progressing.
Many mistakes have been made and corrected.  The process still
continues.  The same may be said of the science of khadi.
If this is intelligently understood and fearlessly acted upon,
replies to the questions presented from time to time become easy.
The spinners must have full knowledege of all the processes from the
beginning to the end, right up to weaving.  In  this lies the way to
swaraj. Up till now, knowingly or unkowingly, we have been
producing khadi solely for pur-poses of commerce.  But this too has
always been linked with the ideal of swaraj.  Had it not been so, even
commercial khadi would have failed, and most probably khadi for
swaraj would have remained a mere dream.  
Commercial khadi has been, and still is, our  go-cart, so to
speak. To the spinner to have her cotton carded by other has been,
and still is, an additional  prop.  Only as we progressively give up
these props, will we bring into being khadi for swaraj.  Those branches
where commmercial khadi is being produced and carding carried on
as  an independent activity should, if possible, be closed down.  Life is,
however, made  up of compromises. Therefore let it be said that the
props should be given up as quickly as possible. Those who have faith
and knowledge will be the first to do  so. Where sincere and earnest
efforts are made, the question of competition should not arise.
One aspect of the present situation needs attention. Those who
spin for their livelihood will willingly learn the news processes because
thereby their earning capacity will increase.  Today this section is
diminishing because other and easier sources of income are open to
them.  For them it is not a moral question.  They take what  is easiest
as, for  example, collection of leaves for making bidis.  It is our  duty
to impart true knowledge to them and help them up the steep road to
swaraj and make them healthy and hardy in the process of climbing.
If we cannot do this, we shall deservedly lose our existence. Theref-180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIore we can only  have dealings with the man or woman who spins with
understanding.
Another thing that has  to be remembered is that spinning is     
now one of the recognized  avocations   and  will,  therefore, continue.  
So we need not worry about the production of commercial
khadi.  Whatever difficulties may arise from the above have to be
overcome by the workers.  To ask whether this or that comes within
this framework is a sign of mental laziness and ignorance.  He who
cannot draw deductions cannot be said to know geometry.  The same
is true of all sciences.

236. LETTER TO T. PRAKASAM
“VALMIKI MANDIR”,
READING ROAD,
NEW DELHI,
April 3, 1946
MY DEAR PRAKASAM,
I have your letter. Most reluctantly I resume English in the hope
that I will not be able to convince you that you are in error.
The whole question arose out of my discussion with your
secretary, Shri Kala Venkatrao. I began a talk with him about you. I
think I enquired how you were able to carry on your practice and also
public work at the same time. He said you were not carrying on any
practice nor conducting a newspaper but that you were living on
purses presented to you by the public and added that he could see
nothing wrong in it. This news left a bad taste in my mouth. This was
the genesis of our correspondence. I think that it is an extremely bad
example. If it is multiplied, purity of public life will come to an end. I
can understand a public fund for the maintenance of public servants
such, or instance, as was raised by the late Jamnalalji for lawyers who
had given up practice in the heyday of non-co-operation. The nucleus
of this fund exists even now and some workers are being supported
out of it. Mahilashram is being conducted in Wardha for the
education of the families of the late Jamnalalji’s friends who had
become servants of the public, relying for their maintenance upon
Jamnalalji. Some of them even go so far as to collect public fundsVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 181which they hand over to the public work for which they may have
been collected. Of this they render a full account and keep nothing
for themselves. But I have never heard of a single instance in which
what you say has been done or can be defended. All the papers that
you have sent to the Sardar and are now sending to me simply show
how in my opinion you have been instrumental, however unwittingly,
in, as I would put it, corrupting public life. I do not know that
evidence you will put before me to convince me to the contrary. It
does not require conviction of friends who doubt the wisdom of the
course adopted by you. But it requires peremptory correction of your
thought and practice and retracing, so far as possible, what has been
done.
I advise your publication of all your doings from the very
beginning. It will be good for you and good for the public and the
cause you and I stand for. Finally, I would go so far as to suggest that
you should, if you do not accept my reasoning, obtain a ruling from
the Working Committee. The matter is too dangerous to be left
undecided.
I am sending a copy of this to the Sardar.
Yours,

240.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING, NEW  DELHI1
April  3,  1946
Gandhiji dwelt at length on the potency of mass prayers.  He said, it gave him
immense pleasure to see large multitudes of people joining mass prayers, which,  he
added, created strength among the people.  He paid a tribute to the people of Assam,
who, if their thousands, joined in the music at  his daily prayers and responded  to the
rhythm of the Ramdhun .  Gandhiji  thought that the Assamese had a natural gift  for
understanding the meaning of the Ramdhun .
Giving his concept of Rama, Gandhiji said that the Rama to whom his prayers
were addressed was not the Rama described in history as  the son of Dasaratha.  He
emphasizd that Rama, Allah  and God are  the  same.  The word Rama attracted
millions of Hindus, and Allah attracted the Muslims. He invited the people belonging
to all faiths to join his prayers.
He congratulated the huge gathering on  maintaining pin-drop silence
throughout the prayers.
Referring to the talks2 he and the other leader were having with the Cabinet
Mission, Mahatmaji said:
If you are anxious to contribute towards the success of these   
talks, I have a suggestion for you.We have been under foreign
domination for many years. You must all pray to  God to deliver us
from political bondage.  God alone can help us. Nobody else can
help, neither you nor Englishmen.  Let us pray to God guide our talks

members of the Mission for carrying the  talks to a successful termin-
ation.  It is essential at this stage to invoke the help of God.  We want
the attainment of freedom by peaceful means.  God will be our guide
and witness in our efforts towards that  end.
It is unmanly to disbelieve the Cabinet Mission. We must believe
that the Mission has come in good faith.  They will not betray us.
May God give them and us wisdom, and may He be with us in this

NEW DELHI,
April 3, 1946
Gandhiji said that it would be better, if the money they wanted to  spend on
entertaining him were spent on educating a Harijan child.  He appealed  to Harijans to
eradicate the evils of wine, gambling and prostitution.  He said that they should be
Bhangis like him.  Defining the term Bhangis he said, it meant a well-wisher of all.
I shall consider my stay among you amply rewarded, if you give
up  these vices.  I  have enjoyed your hospitality.  You can offer me
goat’s milk.  But I will pay for it.  If you are keen that I should take
food prepared by you, you can come here and cook for me.  My real
aim in staying here is to probe into your real needs.
The Hindustan Times,  5-4-1946

Gandhiji,  one of the volunteers was lightly injured.  “I was with great difficulty that
Gandhiji could get into his car.”  Vide also “Speech at Prayer Meeting, New Delhi”,

NEW  DELHI,
April 4, 1946
Gandhiji asked the people to maintain complete silence.  He    
said:
The business which had brought me to Delhi is an important
one, and people should allow me to work in peace.  By collecting here
in this manner you interfere with my work.  If you want, you can see
me at the evening prayers.  I  know that you do all this out of sheer
love   for me.  But even love, if misplaced, does more harm than good.
Consider the happenings of yesterday.2  While I  was going towards
my car, after the evening prayers, people went out of control  and a
volunteer was injured.  Such incidents should not recur.
In the end, I appeal to you to pray to God that India may win
real freedom.  Neither those who have come here nor anybody from
among us can deceive Him.

Q.God is a creation of man’s imagination.  It is not God who
has created man but man who   has created God.  Is this not true?
A.I have taken this from a correspondent’s [long]4 letter.
There is a semblance to truth in what he says.  The writer has, however,
unwittingly created the illusion by a play upon the two words
‘creation’ and ‘God’.
God Himself is both the  Law and the Law-giver.  The ques-       
tion of anyone creating Him, thereofore, does not arise, least of all         
by an insignificant creature such as man. Man can build a dam, but he
canntot create a  river. He can manufacture a chair, but it is beyond

a. m., he saw a noisy crowd waiting for  him outside the Valmiki Temple.

many ways.  But how can man who is unable to create even a river or
wood create God?  That God has created man is, therefore, the pure
truth. The contrary is an illusion. However anyone may,  if he likes,
say that God is neither the doer nor  the cause.  Either is predicable of
Him.

This work has been going on under Prof. T. N. Jagadisan’s
supervision since May 19, 1945.  He has produced a short summary
of the work done from to day.  Dr.  T. S. S. Rajan  is the chairman of
the committee specially formed for this work.  Dr.  V. P. Ramaswami
has specially trained himself for the work under Dr.  R. G. Conhrane.
He is doing out-patient work as well as conducting surveys of villages.
The first survey in Kandachipuram schools of 655 children
revealed that apart from leprosy there was a high incidence of scabies
and guinea worm.  Over 100 children have to be followed up and 30-
40 treated for leprosy.  In Madavilagam village, 18 definite case of
leprosy have been discovered out of 539 inhabitants.  Four of thes are
infective, and fourteen neural.  Infection is spread by indiscriminate
contact of infective cases with children.
In Adukkam village, 15 cases have found out of a population of
323.  Five of these are infective.  Two other places have 29 and 15
definite cases  respectively of which 9 are lepromatons.  
Dr. Ramaswami has also surveyed five more villages and has so
far detected 300 cases out of which 157 only, being women or
children under seven years, can benefit from the Trust.
Prof. T. N. Jagadisan’s summary points out that poor men
patients though in need of attention cannot get the benefit of the
funds.  This defect cannot be  removed by any departure from the
terms of the Trust, but the professor can easily raise a small fund
locally  and bring them within the scope of his work.

NEW  DELHI,
April 4, 1946
Many foreign and local newspaper reporters have been good        
enough to come to me to ask questions on the topic of the day. A
newspaper man myself, I can sympathize with their desire.  But they
should sympathize and co-operate with me in the delicate mission of     
adviser  to the Cabinet Mission when I tell them that I cannot be
advising and broadcasting to the world on the matters covered by my
advice.  Such a course is calculated to defeat the purpose in view.
Anyway these  friends will attribute my silence not to any discourtesy
on my part but to my desire for successful termination of the labours
of  the Cabinate Mission.

246.  SPEECH  AT   PRAYER  MEETING,  NEW DELHI1
April 4, 1946
Gandhiji said, though his prayers contained selected verses from different
religions, their purport remains the same.  He wanted people to come to the prayers
with calm and peaceful mind and participate in Ramdhun .  Thanking the people                      
for maintaining silence, Gandhiji said that the Sanskrit solakas that were recited               
in the prayer had been culled from those chapters of the Gita 2 in which Lord           
Krishna lays down before Arjuna the characterstics of a sthitaprajna .  [Gandhiji
continued.]
If swaraj is to be won through the non-violent strength of the
millions, they must in some measure develop in them the qualities of a
sthitapajna  or the man of steady wisdom.
The ideal is not meant for jnanis 3 only; it is for all,  even   
ordinary lay  people.  Lord Krishna himself is depicted in the
Mahabharata as a charioteer actually driving a team of white horses
while his pupil Arjuna, to whom the Gita discourses are addressed is
pictured as being plebian in his mental make-up and outlook. What

opening paragraph is form The Hindustan Times.
2 II. 58
3 Men of knowledge188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthen are the characteristics of a sthitaprajna?   He is one who withdraw
his senses from the objects of the senses behind the shield of the spirit,
as a tortoise does its limbs under its shell.  A man whose wisdom is not
steady is liable to be betrayed into anger, evil thoughts or abuse.  On
the contrary, the man with the steady wisdom will remain equally
unaffected by adulation or abuse.  He will realize that abuse fouls
only the tongue that utters it, never  the person against whom it is
hurled.  A man of steady wisdom will, therefore, never wish ill to
anyone, but will pray even for his enemy with his  last breath.  
Is it too difficult an ideal to follow?  No.  On the contrary, the
conduct laid down in it is the only conduct worthy of  the dignity  of
human beings.
Today our minds are clouded  by  delusion.  In our ignorance,
we quarrel with one another and indulge in rowdyism against our own
brethren.  For such as these there is neither salvation nor swaraj.  Self-
discipline or rule over self is the first condition for self-rule or swaraj.
All might find it difficult to correctly recite the Gita verses
which are in Sanskrit.  But all can take part in the singing of
Ramdhun .  The mass singing of Ramdhun  to the accompaniment of
tala is prayer reduced to its simplest terms.
‘But how  can non-Hindus take part in it?  The question was
once raised.
I laugh within myself, when someone objects that Rama or the
chanting of Ramanama is for the Hindus only, [and asks] how can
Mussalmans, therefore, take part in it.  Is there one God for the
Mussalmans and another for the Hindus, Parsis or Christians?  No,
there is only one omnipotent and omnipresent God.  He is named
variously, and we remember Him by the name which is most familiar
to us.
My Rama, the Rama of our prayers, is not the historical Rama,
the son of Dasaratha, the King of Ayodhya.  He is the eternal, the
unborn, the one without a second.  Him alone I worship, His aid alone
I seek, and so should you.  He belongs equally to all.  I, therefore, see
no  reason why a Mussalman or anybody should object to taking His
name.  But he is in no way bound to recognize God as Ramanama.
He may utter to himself Allah or Khuda so as not to mar the
harmony of the sound.
Gandhiji strongly deprecated the wastage of food on marriages and other
ceremonial occasions, and said that those who indulged in such extravagant habitsVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 189were the enemies of the people and unfit even to pray.1
Tracing the cause of famine and the other national calamities that occur in our
day-to-day life as due to our  past sins, Gandhiji added that if people did not commit
sins, there would be no famine even if there were no rains.  He emphasized the
importance of morning prayer.  Referring to day-before-yesterday’s incident2
Mahatmaji said: 
There was orderliness until I came.  But such arrangement ought
to have continued till I left the place.  All of a sudden people rushed
towards us with the result I was also slightly injured.  It was my own
fault as the injury was caused by my chappals .  But an innocent
volunteer was badly injured.  In future, nobody should get up till I
leave this place.  People should give up the habit of touching other’s
feet.  They should not swarm towards us.  After all we are not
monkeys, we are human beings.

247.  WHAT  IS  IN  A  NAME?
Q.From the psychological point of view, I think, the name
‘Harijan’ instills into the minds of the people to whom it is applied a
feeling of inferiority, however sacred that name may be.  This feeling
is very difficult to wipe out from them—to whatever extent they are
advanced—if they are always called ‘Harijan’.  Similarly if a man in
the street is asked about a ‘Harijan’, the first thing he will speak of is
‘untouchability and the Depressed Class’.  Would it not be possible to
save the ‘Harijan’ from involuntarily acquiring such an inferiority  
feeling, and other people from thinking about them without the
‘qualification’ usually ascribed to them?  Would it not be preferable      
to choose a name which could also bring in its fold people from           
other sects?
A.This subject was years ago dealt with in the pages of        
Young India .  The name ‘Harijan’ has sacred associations.  It was
suggested by a Harijan as a substitute for Asprishya  (untouchable),    
Dalita (depressed), or for the different categories of ‘untouchables’        
such as Bhangis, Mehtars, Chamars, Pariahs, etc.3 The Government
1 This paragraph is form  The Hindustan Times , and that which follows is
translated from Hindustan .
2 Vide footnote 1, “Advice to Bhangls”, 3-4-1946
3 Vide “My Notes”, Sub-title The Bengal Murder”190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIofficers put them in a schedule and, therefore, called them the
Scheduled Classes, thus making confusion worse confounded.  Those
who were not untouchables were classed among the Scheduled and the
ones who could be so called were excluded.  We have now arrived at a
stage, thanks to the Government policy, when to be included among
the Scheduled Classes is to be coveted.  The Government have created
a separate electorate agitating for seats in all elective institutions.  I do
not mind such ambition, if it carries honest merit with it.  But it
becomes positively mischievous, when seats are coveted irrespective of
merit.  The wish to be so educated as to be qualified for the highest
post is to be appreciated and encouraged, the wish to be appointed to
such a post on the basis of belonging to a caste or a class is essentially
to be deprecated and discouraged.
The real remedy has been suggested by me.  The feeling of
inferiority must go.  It is going, but too slowly.  The process can be
accelerated, if every Hindu would deliberately shed his superiority and
in practice become a Harijan or, if you like, a master, the  lowest class
among Harijans.  Then we all  will become true children of God as the
word ‘Harijan’ means.  Until this is done, no matter which word
signifies ‘untouchables’, it will smell of inferiority.  The process has
to be carried out thoroughly in every walk of life till the last trace of
untouchability is removed.  When that happy day arrives, every
quarter will be a Harijan quarter and cleanliness of the heart and the
home will be the order of the day.

248.  WHAT  IS  THE  LAW?
‘Confused’ writes :
I grant that Italy, Germany and Japan have lost their power;
but is the loss due to their faith in violence, as you would say1, or
is it due to their exhaustion brought about by fortunes of war?
Will you hold that Britain, Russia and America have been
successful because of their non-violence?
Thus argues a correspondent whom I have paraphrased without
diminishing the force of his argument.  The questioner has failed to
perceive that in the writing quoted by him, I have said nothing about
1Vide “Extract from Talk With A Friend”, 3-3-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 191the so-called victorious Powers.  But I have said elsewhere that their
victory is an empty boast, if they do not learn the lesson while there is
time and do not shape their life in accordance with the law of non-
violence.  I believe wholly in the truth that “those who take the sword
will perish by the sword”. There is no doubt that the victors employed
the same means as the vanquished.  There was only a question of
degree.  The victorious parties already seem to be on the verge of
quarrelling among themselves.  If another war has not already begun,
it is because no one is ready to enter upon it.  After all men are not
machines. They cannot be continually fighting without being reduced
to the state of beasts.  One has to hope, for the sake of humanity, that
they will do some hard thinking and discover the truth that the
common man, of whom the world is composed, gains nothing by
cutting his fellowman’s throat and that the fruits of peace are
infinitely superior to those of war.  Ingenuity employed in devising
methods of destruction lowers, whereas when employed in devising
ways of building it befits mankind.

DEAR  SIR  STAFFORD ,
Many thanks for your affectionate letter2.  Sudhir has given me
1 Which, inter alia , read : “When you and I met at my bungalow on Monday
last, and again at the office on Wednesday, you were. . . prepared to have a personal
talk with Mr. Jinnah. . . . But . . . the position has not yet sufficiently clarified . . .
that a meeting between you now would result in any substantial agreement.  I feel that
I should commuicate this view to you without delay as it may affect your plans, and I
could not ask you to stay in Delhi idefinitely.”
In Gandhiji’s Emissary , “The Lesson of Mudurai”, 10--1946, Sudhir Ghosh
explains that on seeing the letter from the addressee, he “felt that the Secretary of
State had not understood the value of keeping Gandhiji in Delhi”.  He, therefore, met
Sir Stafford Cripps and “urged him to do everything in his power” to make Gandhiji
stay in Delhi, which he at once did in letter of even date which read : “I hear that there
is a chance of your extending your stay here and I very earnestly ask you to do so.  We
have still a number of interviews with separate interests and sections to carry out
before we can come to the closer negotiations with the principal parties interested.
This is, therefore, a time of formulation of possibilities, and I know how valuable
your influence will be upon persons of all kinds who seek your advice.  As soon as the
closer negotiations start, I am sure we too shall want to seek that advice, and we
should indeed most sadly miss your help, if you were to leave.  It is not I, but India
that needs you in New Delhi.  Please stay.”

April 5, 1946
So far, Mahatma Gandhi said, he had refrained from saying anything regarding
I. N. A. men, either from platform or in the Press.  This did not mean that he had no
regard or love for them.  He was always conscious of their sacrifices and all that Netaji
Subhas Chandra Bose did was for the freedom of India.  Ever since his visit to the I. N.
A. men in Delhi Cantonment yesterday, his love for them had increased all the more,
he said, and added that they responded to his love with greater love and affection
Mahatma Gandhi declared :
Let me share with you the thoughts that have been crowding in
1 In Gandhi’s Emissary , “Nature  Cure  Clinic”, 10-2-1946, Sudhir Ghosh says:
“I not only delivered this note of warm friendliness to Cripps but brought back
another friendly little note from him to Gandhiji to say : ‘I am so very glad to hear
that you are staying on.  The long list of your callers shows how much you are
appreciated by us all!’ ”
2 The note is written below the one of even date from Agatha Harrison to the
addresssee inviting him for silent get-together.  In Gandhi’s Emissary , “Nature  Cure
Clinic”, 10-2-1946 Sudhir Ghosh explains :  “Good old Agatha, who was everybody’s
mother, organised a Sunday-morning Quaker Worship meeting in New Delhi,
sometimes on a little hall of the Modern School of Barakhamba Road and sometimes
in a ground-floor room in the Y. W. C. A. on Asoka Road where Agatha was staying.”
In Harijan, 28-4-1946, Pyarelal says in “Communion of Silence” that Gandhiji “has
been attending the Sunday silent prayer meeting every Sunday since his arrival” in
New Delhi.  Vide also “Speech at Prayer Meeting, New Delhi”, 7-4-1946
3 In Harijan, the speech appeared under the title “Message of the I. N. A.” by
Pyarelal.  The opeining paragraph is from The Bombay Chronicle Weekly .194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImy mind since yesterday.  India has accorded to the released I. N. A.
men a right royal welcome.  They have been acclaimed as national
heroes.  Everybody  seems to have been swept off his feel before the
rising tide of popular sentiment.  I must, however, frankly confess to
you that I do not share this indiscriminate hero worship.  I  admire the
ability, sacrifice and partriotism of  the I. N. A. and Netaji Bose.   But
I  cannot    subscribe to the method which they adopted and which is
incompatible with the  one followed by the Congress for the last
twenty-five years for the attainment of independence.  Yesterday I
spoke1 to you of a sthitaprajna, i.e., “the man of steady wisdom”, i.
e., a satyagrahi.  If we accept that ideal, we would not regard anybody
as our enemy; we must shed all enmity and ill will. That ideal is not
meant for the  select few—the saint or  the seer only—it is meant for
all.  I  have descri-bed myself as a scavenger, having become one, not
only in name but in fact, while I was in Phoenix.  It was there that I
took up the bucket and the broom, impelled by the inner urge to
identify myself with the lowest of the low.  As a humble fellow-toiler
then let me bear witness that anyone, even a simple-minded villager
who wants to, and tries, can attain the state of mental equipoise
described in the Gita verses which  are recited at the prayer. We all
lose  our  sanity  at  times,  though  we in peace.  It is a higher and
more difficult work.  We have to die performing our duty and without
killing.  For that we shall need to cultivate the attributes of a
sthitaprajna  as set forth in the Gita.       
Far more potent than the strength of the sword is the strength of
satyagraha.  I said so to the I.N.A. men and they were happy to tell
me, as I was to hear, that they had realized this and would hereafter
strive to serve India as true soldiers of non-violence under the
Congress flag.

There is little doubt that India is about to reach her cherished
goal of political independence. Let the entrance be prayerful.  Prayer
is not an old woman’s idle amusement.  Properly understood and
applied, it is the most potent instrument of action.
Let us then pray and find out what we have meant by non-
violence, and how we shall retain the freedom gained by its use. If our
non-violence is of the weak, it follows that we shall never be able, by
such non-violence,, to retain freedom.  But it follows  also that we shall
not, for some length of time, at any rate, be able to defend ourselves
by force of arms, if only because we have neither them nor the
knowledge of their use.  We have not even the requisite discipline. The
result is that we shall have to rely upon another nation’s help, not  as
equals but as pupils upon their teachers, if the word ‘inferiors’ jars
upon our ears.
Hence there is nothing but non-violence to fall back upon for
retaining our freedom even as we had to do for gaining it. This   
means exercise of non-violence against all those who call themselves  
our opponents.  This should not mean much for a man who has used
himself to non-violence for nearly three decades.  It is summed up in  
“die for your honour and freedom” instead of “kill if necessary and  
be killed in the act”.  What does a brave soldier do ?  He kills only if
necessary and risks his life in the act.  Non-violence demands greater
courage and sacrifice. Why should it be comparatiely easy for a  man
to risk death in the act of a killing and almost super human for  him
to do so in the act of sparing life?  It seems to be gross self-deception
to think that we can risk death, if we learn and practice the art of
killing, but cannot do so otherwise.  But for the hypnotism induced by
the repetition of an untruth we should not grossly deceive ourselves.
But the critic or the scoffer will ask, why bring in prayer if the
matter is so simple  as you put it.  The answer is that prayer is the first
and the last lesson in learning the noble and brave art of sacrificing
self in the various walks of life culminating in the defence of one’s
nation’s liberty and honour.
Undoubtedly prayer requires a living faith in God.  Successful
satyagraha is inconceivable without that faith. God may be called by196 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIany other name so long as it connotes the living Law of Life—in other
words, the Law and the Law-giver rolled into one.

EATING   WITH   HARIJANS1
Q.How can a vegetarian caste Hindu sit down to food in the
home  of a meat-eating Harijan ?
A.A vegetarian caste Hindu can eat vegetarian food in the
home of a meat-eating Harijan.  Inter-dining does not imply that one
should eat everything that is put before one.  All that is necessary is
that the food, the plates on which it is served, and the hands that have
cooked it should be clean. The same applies to water.  Nor does inter-
dining mean that people should eat out of the same plate or drink out
of the same glass.  There should be no breach of hygiene.
RAMANAMA
Q.Is it not enough to have Ramanama in one’s heart, or is
there something special in its recitation ?
A.I believe there is special merit in the recitation of
Ramanama.  If anyone knows that God is in truth residing in his heart,
I admit that for him there is no need for recitation.  But I have not
known such a person.  On the contrary, my personal experience tells
me that there is something quite extraordinary in the recitation of
Ramanama.  Why or how is not necessary to know.
MINISTERIAL   SALARIES
Ministers and members of the provincial assemblies are in  
their respective places as servants of the people in every sense of the
term. The British scale of pay cannot be copied by them except at
their cost. Nor need all draw payments because a certain scale is
allowed. The scale fixes the limit up to which they may draw. It will be
ludicrous for a monied man to draw the full or any payment. The
payments are meant for those who cannot easily afford to render free

DEAR  FRIEND,
I write this about two things that I discussed before the Cabinet
Delegation on the 3rd instant.
Sir Archibald Rowlands1 was with me last night in order to   have
a talk with me about the salt tax.  At the conclusion of our talk  he was
frank enough to tell me that, had he met me three months   ago, the
tax would have been abolished.2 I omit the rest of our important
conversation in order to make my letter as brief as   possible.  Regard
being had to the admission, I sent to Sir Archibald Rowlands Shri
Sudhir Ghosh, whom he knows well, to have further   talks with him.
He now contemplates abolition within three months or so.  I know that
nothing can be done by a single official, however strong or able he
may be, unless he is supported by his superiors. And so I invoke your
assistance in this humanitarian work.  But     more even than that is the
consideration that I put before the Cabinet Delegation, viz., that
independence should be ushered in with the greatest good grace
which the poorest villager in the remotest village can at once realize.
More of this you can glean from Sudhir Babu,  if you feel   inclined

2 Pyarelal explains : “In the course of their conversation, Sir Archibald
Rowlands, while admitting to Gandhiji that he had been converted to the propo-
sition for the abolition of the salt tax, seemed to favour the retention of the salt
monopoly by the Government even after the salt tax was abolished.  Gandhiji felt
that this would largely defeat the end in view.  In compliance with Sir Archibald’s
request, he sent him [on April 25] a draft of a proclamation announcing the
termination of the levying of the salt tax and a note on the proposed proclamation.”198 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIand  can  spare  the time. He  is  carrying  this  note.1

257.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI1
April 6, 1946
Twenty-seven years ago when the late Swami Shraddhanandji2
was alive, satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act was inaugurated  on this
day.  History was made the following week.  For the first time theentire masses of India from one end to the other rose like one man.  It    
was an entirely spontaneou s demonstration.
3 I had myself not
imagined that its outcome could be so miraculous.  I could feel God’shand in this miracle.
That was the time when Hindus and Muslims for the time forgot
all their difference.  The Ali Brothers
4 and I used to go all over the
country together like blood-brothers.  We spoke with one voice anddelivered the message of Hindu-Musli m unity and swaraj to the
masses.  We resolved that thereafter we should address our prayers toGod alone, instead of the British Government, and so satyagraha wasborn in India after it was first initiated in South Africa.  On April 13,unarmed civilians were subjected to firing.  The Ali brothers readilyfell in with the programme of a national day of fasting and prayer.People fasted on the 6th and 13th of April.  They realized that theywere all children of the one God, destined to live together and dietogether in the land of their birth, which was India.  They asemebledtogether in their thousands and offered prayers in temples, churchesand mosques. The climax was reached when in Delhi a monster
gathering, consisting of both Hindus and Mussalman, was held in theJuma Mosque and was addressed by the late Swami Shraddhanand.  Itwas a glorious day in India’s histroy, the memory of which we shallalways treasure.
But the situatio n has changed today.  We have gone wrong
1 Gandhiji spoke in Hindustani.  The Harijan report, which appeared under the
title “The Sacred Week” by Pyarelal, has been collated with the Hindi version inHarijan Sevak  published simultaneously with the source.
2 Munshira m Manekchan d (1856-1926) , known as Mahatma Munshiram

3 The following two sentences are translated from Harijan Sevak .
4 Mahomed Ali and Shaukat Ali. The rest of this sentence and the one that
follows are translated from Harijan Sevak .200 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsomewhere.   The hearts of Hindus and Muslims are sundered.  The
air is poisoned with  communal bitternes and rancour.  A section of
the Muslims has begun to  claim that they are a separate nation.   This,
however, is not the time to go into the reason  for it.  I confess that it
baffles my understanding.
Since then we commence our proceedings as today,with prayer1.
If we believe in prayer, we cannot fly at one another’s throat, or
regard anybody as our enemy. At Amritsar people lost their heads.
But we promptly confessed our mistake and made expiation for it by
fasting and praying to God for foregiveness.  To err is human.  By
confessing we convert our mistakes into stepping stones for  advance.  
On the contrary, a person who tries to hide his mistake becomes a
living fraud and sinks down. Man is neither brute nor God but a
creature of God striving to realize his divinity.  Repentance and self-
purification are the means.  The moment we  repent and ask God for
forgiveness  for our lapse, we purged of our sin and new life begins
for us.  True repentance is an essential prerequisite of prayer.
Prayer is not mere lip-service. It must express itself through
action.  How shall we then pray during the Sacred Week?  We can
pray  by purging our  hearts of any taint of communal hatred and ill
will that might be lurking there and invoking God’s aid for the same.
Achievement of communal harmony would thus be one form of
prayer. Then we can pray by doing sacrificial spinning for the
attainment of non-violent swaraj. I  have a vivid recollection of how in
1919 every home in the Punjab hummed with the music of the
spinning-wheel.  A mountain of yarn was presented to me on one
occasion during my tour, which was never equalled before, nor has it
been since, except  recently at Madura during my Madras tour. What
are the sisters of the Punjab doing today?  That is the question which
you must ask yourselves during this week of introspection.  If the four
hundred millions of India took spinning in earnest, and span for
sacrifice, i. e., not for self, with the name of God in their hearts and
with common purpose of winning India’s  freedom through non-
violence, their united effort would not only bring us freedom
assuredly, but also provide us the means for safeguarding it after it is
won, and enable us to point the way out of  darkness to the whole
world.
1 This sentence and the paragraph that precedes are translated from Harijan
Sevak.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 201The other day I  was talking1 to the I. N. A. men in the Red Fort.
We were discussing as to what they should do on their release. They
assured me  that they would, on their release, serve India as true
soldiers of non-violence under the Congress flag.  I told them that
today a true soldier of India is he who spins to clothe the naked, and
tills the soil to grow more food to meet the threatening food crisis.
The Congress has declared that she would carry on the struggle for
India’s independence through the method of non-violence.  But she
has not yet decided whether she would adhere to that method for the
protection of that freedom against possible foreign aggression. To me
it is a self-evident truth that if freedom is to be shared equally by all—
even physically the weakest, the lame and the halt—they must be able
to contribute an equal share in its defence. How that can be possible
when reliance is placed on armaments, my plebeian mind fails to
understand. I therefore, swear and shall continue to swear by non-
violence, i.e, by satyagraha or soul force.  In it physical incapacity is
no handicap and even  a frail woman or a child can put herself or
himself on equal terms against a giant, armed with the most powerful
weapons.
The eighteen-fold constructive programme with the spinning-
wheel as its centre is the concrete expression of that spirit in organized
society.  Let us realize that spirit by devoting ourselves prayerfully to
the carrying out of the constructive programme  during the National
Week.
Harijan, 21-4-1946
258.  A  REMARK2
[April 7, 1946 ]3
I have been praying to God to give me the right word, so that it
will induce those to  whom it is addressed to  act with the courage and
wisdom which the occasion demands.
Harijan, 14-4-1946
1 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting, New Delhi”, 5-4-1946
2  The remark is extracted from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter”. Pyarelal explains
that Gandhiji was “describing to one of his companions” how he “kept awake for
better part of the night on Saturday”, April 6, 1946.  Being aware of the people’s
“deep hatred of the British rule”, Gandhiji was “concerned as to how they would
behave” at the dawn of independence “after the long servitude. . . full of bitter
memories”, and apprehended “conflagration”.
3  ibid202 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI259.  SPEECH  AT   PRAYER  MEETING,  NEW  DELHI 1
April 7, 1946
Mahatma Gandhi referred to his visit to the Quakers’ silent prayer meeting this
morning, and said that people at this meeting sat in absolute silence for half an hour.
They were busy in worship of God and realized the sense of God’s presence in their
midst.   Mahatma Gandhi said that he had himself felt the presence of God during
silence.  He asked the people to observe silence once a week as it played an important
part in the individual’s life.
Gandhiji described how his own experience tallied with that of the Quakers.
Emptying of the mind of all conscious process of thought, and
filling it with the spirit of God unmanifest, brings one ineffable peace
and attunes the soul with the infinite.
The question may, however be raised: Should not one’s whole life be an
unbroken hymn of praise and prayer to the Maker?  Why then have a separate time for
prayer at all?  Brother Lawrence testified that “with him the set times of prayers were
no different from other times, that he retired to pray according to the directions of his
superior, but that he did not want such retirement, nor asked for it.  because his
greatest business did not divert him from God.”  Gandhiji does not question that view.
He observed:
I agree that if a man could practise the presence of God all the
twenty-four hours, there could be no need for a separate time for
prayer.
When the mind is compeletely filled with His spirit one cannot
harbour ill will or hatred towards anyone and reciprocally the enemy
will shed his enemity and become a friend.  It is not my claim that I
have always succeded in converting enemies into friends, but in
numerous cases it has  been my  experience that when the mind is
filled with His peace all hatred ceases.  An unbroken succession of
world teachers since the beginning of time have borne testimory to the
same.  I claim no merit for it.  I know it is the due entirely to God’s
grace.  Let us then in the Sacred Week seek His grace through the
communion of silence and, maybe, the experience will abide us ever
afterwards.
Harijan, 28-4-1946; also The Bombay Chronicle,  8-4-1946
   
1 The speech is extracted from  Pyarelal’s “Communion of Silence”.  The
opening paragraph is from The Bombay Chronicle.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 203260.  VANASPATI  AND  GHEE
Sardar Sir Datar Singh has been putting up a fight on behalf of
the cow in India.  The cow includes the buffalo.  In that case both can
live.  If the baffalo includes the cow then both die.“The cow is the
mother of prosperity.” To understand how this is so, the reader
should see Shri Satis Chandra  Das Gupta’s two instructive volumes1 .
Here I want  to confine myself to ghee which is in danger of being
swamped by vanaspati , as the so-called vegetable ghee is called.  In
reality ghee is pure animal product. One thoughtlessly uses the
expression vegetable ghee or vanaspati , but it is a contradiction in
terms.  Sardar Datar Singh has shown in a considered note that the
sale of vanaspati  has risen from 26,000 tons in 1937 to 1, 37,000 tons
in 11945, i.e., it has increased more than 400 percent during seven
years.  Pari passu  the ghee industry has declined.  Those who would
study the whole note should procure a copy from Sardar Datar Singh
or the Goseva Sangh in Wardha.  I condense below the Sardar’s
conclusions:
1. Vanaspati as an article of diet is a very poor substitute
for ghee. It not only lacks absorption by the hunan system, but
has no vitamin potency.
2.Due to its similarity with ghee in texture and flavour,
most of it is being used as an adulterant or is passed off as
genuine ghee, and is, therefore, a great menace to ghee.
3.Due to great margin of profit in this industry, it has
developed from 26 thousands tons per annum in 1937 to 105
thousands tons in 1943, and there are proposals afoot to at least
double this production in the near future.
4.The ghee industry is India’s greatest cottage industry
involving production of 2,30, 00, 000 maunds of ghee per
annum at a cost of one hundred crores of rupees.
5.The destruction of the ghee industry will not only
adversely affect the welfare of  the cultivators, but it will have a
very delecterious effect on the cattle industry upon which the
prosperiy of the whole nation directly depends.
In order to overcome the difficulties explained above, the
following remedial measures are suggested:
1The Cow in India204 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI1.If, due to  some reasons, the Government cannot
actually ban the manufacture altogether of vanaspati , it must at
least be brought under strict control immediately.
2.All manufacturers and wholesale and retail dealers of
vanaspati  should be licensed. Such person should not be
permitted to trade in  or stock ghee on their premises.
3.It should be made compulsory to colour all vanaspati
at the source of its manufacture in India, and to colour all such
imported product immediately on its landing at an Indian port.
Manufacturers must mix ten per cent of til oil with vanaspati .
The advantage of this would be that, if pure ghee is adultereated
with vanaspati containing 10% til1 oil, the detection will become
extremely simple.  The presence of til  oil can be most easily
detected by well-known chemical reactions.
4.The addition of synthetic essences to give vanaspati  a
semblance of ghee should be prohibited.
5.Persons selling food products in the preparation of
which they use vanaspati  should be required, under marketing
law, to display a sign to that  effect.  The presence of vanaspati
on the premises not displaying the sign should be made an
offence  under law.  This will eradicate the evil of halwais 2 and
confectioners using vanaspati  for their preparations and passing
them off as made from genuine ghee.
6.Vanaspati  should not be allowed to go in the market
under names such as ‘Vegetable Ghee’ or ‘ Vanaspati Ghee’  or
any other name which is apt to deceive the customers as to its
real origin of composition.
7. Vanaspati  should not be allowed to be marketed in
packages of the same pattern as used for packing ghee and all
pakages containing vanaspati   should be distinctly labelled.
It is clear that the mischief arises principally from the greed   of
the very persons who worship the cow. Vanaspati is wholly
superfluous. Oils may be refined of injurious property, but they  do
not need to be solidified nor need they  be made to look like ghee.
An honest manufacturer will not stoop to counterfeits. The market is
flooded with them. Counterfeit coins are heavily punishable. Why not
counterfeit ghee, since the genuine article  is much more precious
than coins?  But the sovereign remedy lies in all round honesty

Boiled milk is certainly better. Add some potassium

It is good to throw some lime into the well.  You may also throw
some bleaching powder.  If pure water is available, then there is no
need of disinfectants.
It irks me that the grinding stone cannot be stopped even for
two minutes for the sake of silence.  Two minutes is nothing.  Just the
same, Babaji1 may do what he thinks right.

275.  LETTER  TO G. RAMACHANDRA  RAO
      HARIJAN   MANDIR ,   NEW   DELHI,
April 9, 1946
DEAR  RAMACHANDRA  RAO,
I  have your letter1 . Though there is a resemblance between
your thought and practice and mine superficially, I must own that
yours is far superior to mine.  Having made that admission let me
emphasise the fact that deep down there is  a fundamental difference
between you and me and, therefore, your thought and mine.  For you
consciously ignore God. Equally consciously, probably more prog-
ressively, I rely upon God.  Therefore your complaint is hasty.  You
will be better able to judge, if you survive me  and vice versa.
Do not think of passing any time with me  whilst I am
wandering.  I may be said to be not wandering when I am in
Sevagram.  Therefore come to me whenever I  am there.
yours2

It was written in another hand and Bapuji signed the letter.  The letter was closed at
first with ‘Yours sincerely’; but when Bapuji signed it, he scored out ‘sincerely’ left
‘Yours’ stand.  I did not underestand why ‘sincerely’ was scored out and so I wrote to
Bapuji.. . . I got the following reply from. . . Amrit Kaur . . . .‘“Yours sincerely” is
too formal; therefore the word was struck out.  What else could there be in it?’”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 213276.  LETTER  TO  LAKSMINARAYAN  GADODIA

I have your letter.  How can one be called a naturopath, if one

Why don’t you give up the land and house since you are resting

Your statement of complaint is not as it ought to be, but I have
sent it over to Gadodaji for his reply3. The letter of authority for

April 9, 1946
Referring to  the Quakers’ Association of New Delhi, Gandhiji said that people
from different religions observed silence there for long time.  According to him, there
is only one God or Allah in every religion.  We should thus not hate followers of
others religions.  We should also learn the method of keeping peace by observing
silence like the Quakers.  Peace is a great strength.  If we fail to understand the way of
keeping peace, no doubt  the country will  get independence but the freedom thus
achieved would serve no purpose.  If plunder and pillage and murders were still there,
you would soon lose interest in swaraj.
Gandhiji said that we should not kill or torture others.  We should rather learn
how to kill ourselves and never others.  Those who know how to die, also know how
to live.  But those who torture and kill others remain as burden on earth.
In the end, Gandhiji appealed to women to maintain silence in the prayer
meeting in future.

NEW DELHI,
April 10, 1946
MY DEAR KALESWAR RAO,
I have your letter. If all that you say about the state of affairs in
Andhra is correct it is terrible and only Andhra people themselves can
put things right.
Your defence of Shri Prakasam is wholly unwarranted by facts.
If every Congressman were to make use of money presented to him
by the public for personal needs the Congress as an organization
would cease to exist. I have not known such a thing during the long
course of my public life.
I met and had a long talk last night with the Madras M.L.A.s of
whom Shri Prakasam was one. His philosophy of the correctness of
which he is convinced appals me. I have gone so far as to tell him that
1 The report said: “Contrary to his practice of addressing only after the  
prayer, Gandhiji, who heard some noise from the side of women, spoke even  before
the  prayer and particularly advised the women on the importance of maintaining
silence.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 215he should take a back seat, i.e., not dream of taking ministership and
not even retain his seat in the legislature. You and he may think
differently and even the Congress Working Committee may not
subscribe to my views. But I have suggested that he should seek the
decision of the Working Committee in this matter.1

MY DEAR PRAKASAM,
I have received your long exposition with which I heartily
disagree. The worst form of receiving money you have considered to
be the best. It is pity that you do not see the danger behind it. I tried
to explain but I failed.
There were two things which I did not want to discuss in the
midst of the company we had last night. You had from the Congress a
sum of money which you never returned; similarly, from the
Provincial Congress Committee, which also you did not return. This
news has come to me without seeking. If the information is wrong,
you will tell me. If it is not, you will see how wrong it was.
The Swarajya2 affair also seems not to have been creditable.
All these things have come to me after our correspondence. I
wish you would make a clean breast of all your affairs and produce an
accurate account of all your doings. If they have been questionable,
or if there is anything that cannot be defended by sane people, you
should retire into private life and think out what your obvious duty is.
It grieves me to write this letter and yet I must if I am to be
absolutely frank with you. I would have discussed these things with

CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
I have your letter.  Why ‘Yours’ only?
The letter is not good.  It stinks of pride.  Bhansali is a     noble
soul.   One should not mind, if he says anything.  You should   not
feel hurt, if anyone says anything.  These are he qualties of a

Let noble people be our watchmen.  It does not mean that we should
do all that they say, but we should be more alert when they say things
to us.  Where is the point in laying down a condition for me?  When I
lose faith in you I will tell you so, as I did in the case of Dahyalal.

283. TALK WITH SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS
NEW DELHI,
April 10, 1946
After a few preliminaries I told Sir Stafford that I had come in
response to the message he had sent and added “I am at your service
now.”
CRIPPS : I am glad you have been good enough to come for this chat. The whole
thing is off the record and let us have a free and frank talk. Will you please let me have
your appraisal of the situation ?
GANDHIJI : It is too soon for me to give any definite appraisal. Day
to day developments are as much within your knowledge as mine. So
far as I am able to say, you and the Mission have come out with two
objectives —the setting up of a machinery for framing the new
constitution and the formation of an Interim Government at the
Centre. Are you hopeful of solving both the problems on this visit ?
C. I am quite hopeful. I can tell you that we do not mean to go back from this
country without solving both of them.
G. Cutting across both those problems is the issue of Pakistan. If
you are hopeful of solving both those problems it means that you
have in the first instance to reach a decision on the issue of Pakistan.
C. Yes, you are right. I would only add that we propose to reach a decision on
the preliminary issue by bringing about an agreement.
G. The prospects of an agreement do not seem to look bright.
You have no doubt been reading the statements and interviews given
recently by Jinnah and the speeches which have been made at the
Muslim Legislators’ Convention.
C. Of course, I have. They breathe fire and brimstone. But you can take it from
me that they do not disturb us. I am quite accustomed to such things in my own218 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcountry.G. That may be so. But the effect of such statements and
utterances may not be the same in this country as it is in your country
with seasoned politics.
C. When I find a person getting louder and more violent in his denunciations
of his opponents. I get the feeling, as with your experience you will get under the
same circumstances, that he is beginning to recognise that the extreme case for which
he stands is becoming desperate.
G. I am very glad that the Mission whose advent to and presence
in this country are the immediate provocation for these intensified
denunciations, is not taking them at their face value. But you were
mentioning that you hoped to reach a solution on Pakistan by
agreement. In the present tempers of the two main parties, particu-
larly of the Muslim League, it is difficult to see how an agreement
could be reached.
C. Has not the issue been reduced to a narrow one ? The question is about the
machinery for the administration of common subjects like defence, foreign affairs,
etc. Jinnah says that arrangements for their administration should be made by treaty
between Pakistan and the rest of India. The Congress says you must have a federal
centre for administering them. The gulf between these two points of view is by no
means unbridgeable.
G. But are not the two points of view fundamentally different ?
The one is thinking of two independent sovereign states having treaty
relation with each other, while the other is thinking in terms of a single
federal State in which these common subjects would be assigned for
administration to a Centre.
C. That of course is so; but where differences of opinion of
such a nature do crop up it is quite possible for the two parties to
come to an agreement if only they will meet, sit down and try to
arrive at a solution by a process of give and take. From my
experience I could tell you that the issue is dispute and the difference
to be reconciled cannot be considered too difficult for arriving at an
agreed solution. In international affairs much bigger issues between
Governments have been and are being settled by that process. It will
be necessary for the Congress and the League each to come down a
bit and meet.
G. Where are they to meet ? What is the half-way house that you
want them to meet at ?
C. There is something like a confederation and a confederal
Centre.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 219G. Would not a confederal Centre mean merely a gathering of
representatives of Governments of Independent States ?
C. Yes.
G. And there would be no legislature of other auxiliary things
which you find in a Centre of the usual type ?
C. No.
G. What  about  the  sanction  behind  the  decision  which such a
confederate machinery will take ? C. No doubt it will be a loose unit. But it is
unnecessary for me to point out to you that the States of the American Union formed
first a confederation which later on developed into a federation. There is no reason
why a similar thing should not happen in India.
G. But you forget, however, some rather fundamental differences
between the two cases. In the case of America the states were
independent units which first formed a loose kind of union. They
found that union did not satisfy their requirements and therefore
developed the closer federal union that now exists. In India we have
now a unitary state with a common Centre. You propose to scatter the
units in this state.
C. Oh, no. No, I am not scattering them.
G. When I said you are now scattering them I did not intend to
convey that you personally were doing or wanted to do so. I am only
trying to put to you my understanding of the proposal that you
apparently have under consideration, of forming a confederal union
between the proposed Pakistan and the rest of India. To resume what I
was saying, the units of the existing unitary Indian State will, if the
Pakistan idea is accepted, be scattered and then given the option of
grouping themselves as they like into two or more independent States
and come together in a loose confederation in the hope that later on
the deficiencies of such a confederal arrangement will compel them to
convert the confederal into a closer federal union. In other words the
ultimate development visualised is, so far as inter-relations between the
units and the administration on common subjects are concerned, to
bring them into more or less the condition in which they are today.
C. I see your point, but if agreement has to be arrived at, we cannot altogether
justify an acceptable or accepted solution on the basis of argument alone. We have
got to take psychological considerations into account. All the same I do not wish you
to take away from this conversation the idea that I am finally committed to the
solution being found in the shape of a confederation.
G. I understand, but what psychological consideration are you220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthinking of ?
C. Rightly or wrongly the Muslims have now very widespread amongst them
the fear of Hindu domination and if India is to get on peacefully in the future they have
to be convinced that the political system that is to be set up will be one which will
remove this fear.
G. I am all for doing everything that in reason is possible for
removing this fear. But in the conditions of this country and taking
into account the members of Muslims involved and the manner in
which they are distributed it is difficult for anybody to agree that the
removal of this fear can be accomplished only or even most
successfully by setting up an independent State where, though the
Muslims may be in a majority, there will be a very large population
ofnon-Muslims to reckon with. What are the grounds for your hope
that an agreement could be reached between the parties and how
could the reaching of such an agreement be furthered ?
C. Between you and me, I may tell you that in spite of all the violent speeches
that have been made within the last two days at the Muslim Convention, leading
representatives of the Muslim community are, even as we are talking now furiously
thinking as to how best they could moderate their published demands so as to arrive at
a settlement with the other party and if a gentleman like you could go round Delhi and
speak to your Muslim friends and bring them round to realise that if they did not show
a spirit of accommodation they stood the risk of the decision of the Mission going
against them on the issue of Pakistan, it would be of great assistance.
G. All advice which may come from people like me is suspect in
Muslim circles. Emotionally worked up as Muslim sentiment is today,
the more effective method of making them climb down from their
extravagantly high perch is for you or other members of the Mission
giving to Jinnah as early as you can a broad hint that there was no
likelihood of Pakistan being agreed to by the Mission or His
Majesty’s Government.
C. No doubt that would be more effective, but the time is not yet for your
making known even in an informal way what might be our ultimate decision even if
we had reached one already.
G. I should have thought that there could be no hesitation in this
matter. With all the background of your history in this country, your
present position and the state system you have built up, it is impossible
for a person like me to imagine that if you were put on your
conscience and asked to give a fair decision on the merits your
judgment would be in favour of dividing the country into two or moreVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 221independent States.
C. I  quite appreciate  your point of view, but where agreement has to be arrived
at, it  may be necessary for  the party even  with the  strongest case agreeing to accept
something  less than what it may rightly be considered entitled to in order to avoid a
possible  decision against them. Often in  my practice at  the Bar, parties with a very
strong case for whom I  was appearing have come to me and said, “no doubt our  case
is very strong, but we do not know what the judge might finally decide. Meanwhile
the other  side is offering to  compromise on terms which although less than what we
are rightfully entitled to are still sure and certain. We have to place this against a
possible adverse finding of the judge. Shall we accept those terms ?”
G. If  the two main protagonists do come to a settlement, nothing
could  be more satisfactory. But the danger of a compromise is that
the terms may be such, especially when they are dictated by pressure
from a  third  party, as would  not in the long run satisfy or be in the
interests of the one party or the other or perhaps even both.
C. There   is  that  point  no   doubt  but  has  not  it  happened
in   Indian   history  already  that   the  country  has  settled  down  to
decisions   which   when  given  did  not  please  any  party,  as   the
Communal Award for instance.    G. The  Communal Award has no
doubt been aquiesced in though everybody not excluding the
Muslims have been loudly complaining against it. But its successful
enforcement is due primarily to the fact that the British have been in
power and also strong enough to force down even an unpopular
decision of that sort. The conditions will, however, be very different if
on the issue of Pakistan you give a decision of a similar nature. India
will be declared independent. You will not be here to face the risk that
will inevitably follow such a decision. You will not be doing a service
to the country by giving a decision which will intensify communal
conflict and lead perhaps to a civil war, the responsibility for tackling
which will not be yours. So any decision that you give has more
chance of being implemented successfully after you leave if it is one
which is justifiable on the merits. If on the other hand it is one which
attempts merely to decide the dispute between two antagonists by
denying to each a portion of his claim, whatever the merits may be, it
will leave a trail of trouble behind.
C. I agree that there are risks but we are determined to see that a settlement is
reached and if it is not reached by ageement between the parties, to give a decision
ourselves.
G. I have always been a staunch supporter of the view that if the222 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIparties in this country do not come to an agreement, the British
Government which is in power today cannot escape the responsibility
of giving a decision. There are suggestions for arbitration.
C. I know, but if the parties concerned agree to refer an issue like Pakistan for
decision of a committee consisting of a Russain, a Turk and a Chinese, I cannot see
why we should stand in the way. No doubt in view of all the connections that exist
between us and India and the knowledge that we possess of conditions here there is
justification for your view that the British should give a decision; but if the parties to
the dispute themselves prefer to agree to abide by the decision of an outside
committee of the sort I mentioned, I cannot see why I should stand in the way. The
main thing is the reaching of a settlement which both parties will accept.
G. Sir Stafford, as regards the constitution-making machinery, I
presume you will agree that you cannot have two constitution-making
bodies or I understand the suggestion has been made of two
compartments of a single constitution-making body unless the
decision is first taken in favour of Pakistan. Such a decision
necessarily implies that provinces will have to decide beforehand
which constitution-making body or compartment of a single
constitution-making body they will go into.
C. Yes.
G. Similarly,  Indian States  will have to choose in a similar way.
C. Yes, but we cannot rule out the possibility in that case of the
Indian States wishing to have a constitution-making body of  their
own! 
G. Are you contemplating seriously of these complications ?
C. There are complications but the whole thing will depend upon the
agreement reached on the question of Pakistan. That hurdle has to be crossed before
everything else.
G. How  do  you  propose to  set  up  the  constitution-making
body? What is the authority which will constitute it ? By Act of
Parliament ?
C. (After some hesitation) I am afraid we have not thought this out. I should
not think that an Act of Parliament is necessary for this purpose.
G. If not an Act of Parliament, there should be at least a
proclamation of His Majesty. The matter is, you will agree, big
enough not to be left to be provided for by a Press communique of
the present Government of India or even by an announcement by the
Viceroy.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 223C. We shall no doubt go into this question. The main thing is that we should
reach an agreement first on the issue of substance. When such agreement is reached we
shall take the best advice that is available and implement it in the form most suitable.
G. What about the Indian States ? Do you think they will come
in without standing out for things which it might be difficult to agree
to ?
C. I do not foresee any great difficulty from that quarter.
G. What about Paramountcy ? Where will it rest after you
transfer power ?
C. Paramountcy when we go will have to disappear. When India gets
independence not only British India but every one of the Indian States will become
independent.
G. All the 562 or 601 of them ?
C. Yes, and when they so become independent it will be for each of them to
negotiate fresh arrangement with the new Government of India.
G. This will be another additional complication which you will
introduce as the result of your quitting power in India. It is difficult
for me to think that you should expect 562 States each to negotiate
seperately a new arrangement with the Government of India. Even
now there are only about 40 States with treaties and they as well as the
rest of the States are all really held together by the British power
exercising paramountcy.
C. But it is difficult to expect a State like Hyderabad with permanent treaty
relations with the British Crown to agree to any arrangement over its head. It might
well say whatever you and the new Government may do we refuse to recognise it.
G. With such experience of Indian States as I possess, it is difficult for me to
believe that an Indian State, even  if  it be Hydera-bad, could  maintain  the position
that  it  will  not acquiesce in the arrangements which are made by the paramount
power.    C. You are probably right in saying that even Hyderabad could not maintain
such an attitude for long. But we cannot ignore our obligations. What is that you
yourself would suggest ?
G. The natural thing. British power over Indian States is
exercised through paramountcy. You are transferring power to Indian
hands. The authority which takes your place in British India should
exercise that paramountcy after you hand over power.
C. That is not the law.
G. I cannot follow you. Was not it law in 1858 and in 1935 ?
C. But surely if bad law was perpetrated in the past you would224 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHInot advise us to follow that example now.
G. You are not squarely facing the problem. That bad law has
been in force and all States have settled down to it for nearly a
century.
C. We have certain obligations to States under paramountcy-protection for
instance. We were able to discharge this obligation because there was the Royal Navy
and the Royal Air Force at our disposal. But the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force
will not be available after India becomes independent. It would not be right for us to
tell the States that as we are quitting India we are handing over our obligations to a
new Indian Government which [do not] have such forces at its disposal and which
therefore will not be in a position to implement those obligations. It is for the States
to look out for themselves and if they are so minded, to make fresh trials with the new
Government of India.
G. What do you mean when you say that the new Indian
Government will not be in a position to implement their obligations of
protection of Indian States ?
C. It is obvious that the new Government will not have at its disposal a Navy
and Air Force sufficient to defend even itself.
G. You  are  exaggerating the position. It is true that the Indian
Navy and  the Indian Air Force  have to  be greatly developed  before
they  can be  considered efficient parts of  the armed  forces of an
independent  India. But while they are being developed new India will
certainly make other arrangements, for example by treaty with Britain,
for having at its disposal their Naval and Air units to  help her in
defending the country. Defending the country will include defending
the Indian States as  well and  it should not  be  impossible  so to make
arrangements  with Britain that  the New  India Government  will be in
a position to  implement  the obligations of  paramountcy which it
will inherit  from the British power. Again, you surely do not think
that in protecting Indian States British  power  had to place any
reliance worth mentioning on the Navy and Air Force. That protection
was largely given by the Indian army and even from the
commencement of the new regime, we shall have, according to the
Commander-in-chief, an Indian Army which would be quite capable
of providing fully for the internal defence requirements of the
country.
C. There is the other point that the treaties were made by the British Crown and
therefore except with their consent the obligations could not be transferred by the
Crown to any other authority.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 225G. I have already said that you have effected these transfers twice
in recent history. On the first occasion Rulers of States were not even
consulted, I believe. That was in 1858 when the Crown took over the
relations with Indian States from the East India Company and
administered those relations through the Governor-General in
Council, that is the Government of India. In 1935 this arrangement
gave place to a new one under which the Crown withdrew the powers
from the Governor-General in Council and vested them in a Crown
Representative. Under independent India both the Governor-General
in Council and the Crown Representative will presumably disappear.
Their places will have to be taken by the new Government of what is
now British India. If the transfer of paramountcy to this new
Government could be effected with consent of Indian States and on
terms, perhaps, which might be made more acceptable to them than
those on which paramountcy is exercised today by the Crown
Representative it will be to the good, but if all or some of the States
should hesitate as regards this transfer it has to be made in spite of
such hesitation, for otherwise not merely the defence and foreign
policy of India, but even the efficient internal administration of
common economic and other matters will become almost impossible.
C. Formerly it was the Governor-General that was controlling the Indian
States.
G. You are mistaken. The authority that was in law responsible
for the conduct of relations with Indian States was, from 1858 to
1935, the Governor-General in Council and not the Governor-
General.
C. But then the Governor-General under that system was an autocrat and
exercised all powers.
G. That may have been so but I thought you were placing
insistence on the letter of the treaties and on the legal position as
regards the obligations of paramountcy and you cannot deny that
from those two points of view the authority concerned was the
Governor-General in Council and not the Governor-General up to
1935.
C. Have nothing more to say on the subject of Indian States.
G. There is one point I would like to draw your attention to. The
enormous proportions which communal tension has reached in the
country are directly traceable to separate electorates. You cannot have
healthy political life in any country where the electorates which226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIshould exercise the sovereign controlling power are based upon
religion, race, creed or caste. If in connection with the negotiations
you are now engaged in, it is possible as part of the agreement which
you propose to see arrived at between the parties you can put pressure
on them for substituting joint electorates for separate electorates, it will
be a service of incalculabe value to the future political development of
India.
C. I am all with you as regards separate electorates. But don’t you think that we
should rather not touch that question but leave it to the Interim Government and the
constitution-making body ?
G. The immediate matter for settlement no doubt is the issue of
Pakistan, the formation of an Indian Government and the convening
of a constitution-making body. But I thought it would be helpful to
the Interim Government and the constitution-making body if while
pressure is being applied on both parties for a settlement on the major
issue of Pakistan this important problem of electorates is also tackled
and that even if a final decision is not arrived at on it now the way
could be paved for a fairly satisfactory solution at the proper time. Let
me add that separate electorates are unhealthy not only to the
Government of a united India; in fact if Jinnah has his way about
Pakistan—which God forbid—separate electorates will prove a greater
headache to Pakistan than to Hindustan. The Muslim minority in the
Hindustan of Jinnah’s conception will be 20 millions against a Hindu
population in the same area of about 150 millions. On the other hand
the non-Muslim minority in Pakistan will be 44 millions against a
Muslim population therein of about 70 millions.
C. Oh ! That is Jinnah’s Pakistan ! It is an impossible idea. To think of setting
up a new State of Pakistan with so heavy a Hindu minority of 44 millions which will
always be in opposition to the Government of Pakistan ! It is inconceivable. I think
you will agree that this question of electorates is left over for decision by the
constitution-making body.
After a few final words of courtesy we parted. At the door  Sir
Stafford said he hoped he would have an opportunity of meeting me
again and added with a twinkle in his eye “before we leave this
country at the end of July”. I turned round to him and said, “July !”
Sir Stafford then said, “I do hope we shall be able to leave earlier but
I thought I would mention a safe limit !”

April 10, 1946
In that hymn there is an assurance that whom God protects, no
power on earth can injure.  The message of that hymn has a particular
relevancy in the present times when the whole world is plunged in
strife.  Although the war has ended, the causes that bought it about   
still continue.  This is not peace; it is only silent preparation for
another war.
Look at the mutual recrimination, abuse and threats of violence
that poison the atmosphere in Delhi itself.  But, if  you have  faith in
God, you will remain unaffected by all these threats and abuse, and
feel secure in the assurance that not a hair of your head will be injured
so long as you are under God’s protecting care.  There is a saying to
the effect that the outer is only the reflection of the inner.  If you are
good, the whole world will be good to you.  On the contrary, if you    
feel tempted to regard anybody as evil, the odds are that the evil is
within you.
The Choudhari Saheb2 has had great regard for me.  If,  
therefore, somebody comes and tells me that he has abused the   
Hindus and called them names, I must refuse to believe it or think ill
of him. How can a person who till yesterday was  like a blood-brother
to me turn all of a sudden into a hater of  Hindus?  I would rather
think that some Hindus has exasprated  him by their behavior and
made him  lose his  balance. Similarly I am quite sure that if the
Choudhary Saheb were to meet me today and I were to ask him if he
really believed that the whole mass of Hindus had turned bad
overnight, he would laugh at the remarks attributed to him and dismiss
them as absured.  We must neither think evil about others nor suspect
others of thinking evil about us.  Proneness to lend ear to evil reports
is a sign of lack of faith.

April 11,1946
What particularly delighted Gandhiji during both these visits2 was to see so
many officers and men representing so meny different religions and races of India
drawn together in a common cause—the cause of India’s freedom—and living together
like members of one   family.  It was like a whiff of fresh invigorating air from the
free India that is to be.  The absence of the third party had enabled them to obliterate
all communal distinctions and develop a perfect spirit of comaraderie  in exile, but in
detention, these distinctions were again being brought home to them. 
“We never felt any distinction of creed or religion in the I. N. A.” remarked
one of them.  “But here we are faced with ‘Hindu tea’  and  ‘Mussalman tea’.  What are
we to do?” Gandhiji asked:
Why do you suffer it?
“No, we do not,” they replied. “We mix ‘Hindu tea’ and Musalman tea’  exactly
half and half, and then serve.  The same with food.   Gandhiji replied (laughing):
That is very good.3

289.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  NEW  DELHI
April  11, 1946
Summing up his reactions of his second visit4, Gandhiji, in course   of his
remarks at the evening prayer, narrated how Col. Niranjan Singh Gill,     speaking for
the I.N.A. prisoners in the Red Fort, had told him that they  were finally convinced
that India could not win or retain her independence   except through non-violence.
1 This and the following items are extracted from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter”.
Pyarelal explains that Gandhiji met “some 35 I.N.A. prisoners. . . detained in the Red
Fort”.  According to report in The Bombay Chronicle, 12-4-1946, Gandhiji, who was
accompanied by Vallabhbhai Patel and Pyarelal, met the officers in the afternoon for
about half an hour.

Meeting, New Delhi”, 5-4-1946
3Vide also the following item.
4Vide the preceding item.230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThey had further assured him that after their release they would serve India as true
soldiers of non-violence.  “We shall disdain to depend on anybody’s charity for our
support,” they had told him.  “We would rather dig the ground and till the land than
compromise our self-respect by living on subscriptions.”  Gandhiji said :
I told them that they would be sadly disillusioned, if they
thought that a free India would be able to provide them all those
emoluments, honours and perquisites which a foreign Government
gave to the army men by the exploitation of the masses, while
education, public health and the allied nation-building activities were
starved.  India was  a poor country, her children were born in poverty
and grew up in poverty into anaemic, stunted specimens of humanity.
If they wanted to become true soldiers of India, they must be prepared
to share her destitution and try to ameliorate it to the best of their
capacity, not expect to be pampered at the cost of the poor.   A true
soldier would prefer death to charity.  In reply, they assured me that
Netaji had inculcated upon them the twin lessons of poverty and
equality.
Among us, officers and men live together and dine together without any
distinction.  There is no high, no low.1
Continuing, Mahatma Gandhi mentioned how he had asked the military
officer-in-charge of the camp whether the I.N.A. personnel were well-behaved.  The
officer had replied that he was very pleased with their behaviour.  The I.N.A. people
on their part had no complaint to make about the treatment they were receiving.  He
considered all that to be a very healthy sign.  He interpreted it as indication of things
to come.  A free India would not want to harbour bitter memories against anyone and
would like to make friends with all including the Britishers.
In conclusion, he referred to the labours of the Cabinet Mission and suggested
that all should pray during the National Week so that God might guide them as well as
the people into right at this critical juncture in India’s history.

1 What follows is from The Bombay Chronicle .VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 231290.  WHAT  ABOUT  WOMEN? 1
I am glad to read your reply2 to the complaint that enough women have
not been put up for elections or selected for official posts. . . . Neither in the
ministries and legislatures nor in local bodies is merit given first cosideration
in the matter of selection of candidates.  Consideration in the matter of
selection of candidates.  Consideration of caste, community and province
come into the picture and are the determinig factors.  The argument proffered in
favour of such action is that none of these interest can be ignored.  If the
argument holds, what about the interests of women ? . . .
The above is from the letter3 of an esteemed sister.  The sister’s
argument boils down to this, that where everything is on a wrong basis,
another wrong will not matter.  But, if we go on thus, the evil will grow
and we shall be hopelessly caught in a vicious circle.  My appeal to
women, therefore, is that they should intelligently become the personi-
fication of renunciation and thereby not only adorn but also raise the
status of their sex and the nation.
So long as considerations of caste and community continue to
weigh with us and rule our choice, women will be well-advised to
remain aloof and thereby build up their prestige.  The question is as
to how best this can be done. Today few women take part in politics
and most of these do not do independent thinking. They are content
to carry out their parents’ or their husband’s behests. Realizing their
dependence, they cry out for women’s rights. Instead of doing this,
however, women workers should enrol womenas voters, impart or have
imparted to them practical education, teach them to think indepen-
dently, release them from the chains of caste that bind them so as to
bring about a change in them which will compell men to realize
women’s strength and capacity for sacrifice and give her places of
honour.  If they will do this, they will purify the present unclean
atmosphere.  So much for women.
As to men, they should consider it their duty to come out of the
impure atmosphere wherever it exists.  They will not beguided by
cosiderations of caste and community, if these are banished from their
own minds.  The best and easiest way to achieve this is for both men

3 Of which only extracts are reproduced here.232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIand women to stoop to conquer by becoming Harijans and that too of
the last class., i.e., Bhangis or Mehtars.  
Where capable women have been left out, men should make
amends.  It is their duty to give such encouragement to women as will
enable them to outshine men. If both parties act as suggested, the
atmosphere will soon become pure. Whether men do so or not,
women’s duty is, to my mind, clear.

DEAR  SIR  STAFFORD,
What I wanted to say and forgot last night was about the States
of India. Pandit Nehru is the President of the States’ People’s
Conference and Sheikh Abdullah of Kashmir its Vice-President. I met
the committee of the Conference last Wednesday. Their complaint was
that they were ignored by the Cabinet Delegation whereas the Princes
were receiving more than their due attention. Of course this may be
good policy.  It may also be bad policy and morally indefensible. The
ultimate result may be quite good, as it must be, if the whole of India
becomes independent.  It will then be bad to irrritate the people of the
States by ignoring them. After all the people are everything and, the
Princes apart from them nothing.  They owe their artificial status to
the Government of India but their existence to the people residing in
the respective States.  This may be shared with your colleagues or not
as you wish.  It is wholly unofficial as our talk last night was.
Yours sincerely,

When I look at you I find very few people wearing khaddar.  It
is a sign of our misfortune.  It is estimated that we pay over sevenVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 233crores of rupees in purchasing foreign cloth.  We used to supply cloth
to the whole world, but today all of our trade in textiles is gone.
Since 1919 we have been trying to revive it.  The Charkha
Sangh has chalked out a programme for the revival of khadi.  Some
people sell away all the yarn they spin because they get money for it,
and when asked if they have kept yarn for their own use, they say that
they could get cheaper cloth made in Manchester or Japan.  Khaddar
should occupy a higher status, if we really want to attain swaraj
through it.  The yarn should be spun and woven into cloth in the
villages.
People should go to Khadi Bhandars and get the cloth in return
for handspun yarn.

293.  FASTING  IN  THE  AIR1
Fasting has become a veritable epidemic.  The blame lies at your door.
So writes a correspondent and adds :
One can understand the efficacy of a fast for purpose of inward
purification as also for the outward.  But fasts are undertaken nowadays for an
increment in one’s own pay or in that of one’s group, for being selected as a
candidate for the Assembly or for various other causes.  You encourage one
man for fasting for the removal of untouchability and yet you are willing to let
another die who is doing the same for a different cause.  Is this not injustice ?
Should you not lay down rules as to when to fast and when not to, what should
be its duration, should fruit-juices be taken or only water ?  You talk of the
inner voice where you are concerned.  Would it not really be best, if you were
to stop undertaking fasts yourself and stop others too?
There is force in the above argument.  It is, however, impossible
to lay down rules.  Experience alone can suggest rules.  In particular
cases it is open to a person to frame his own law or he can refer to me,
if he believes me to be an authority.  I have had the temerity to claim
that fasting is an infallible weapon in the armoury of satyagraha.  I
have used it myself, being the author of satyagraha .  Anyone whose
fast is related to satyagraha should seek my permission and obtain it
in writing before embarking on it.  If this advice is followed, there is
1 Originally written in Gujarati, this appeared as “from Harijanbandhu ”
published simultaneously with the source.234 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIno need for framing rules, at any rate, in my lifetime.
One general principle, however, I would like to enunciate.  A
satyagrahi should fast only as a last resort when all other avenues of
redress have been explored and have failed.  There is no room for
imitation in fasts.  He who has no inner strength should not dream of
it, and never with attachment to success.  But, if a satyagrahi once
undertakes a fast from conviction, he must stick to his resolve whether
there is a chance of his action bearing fruit or not.  This does not
mean that fasting cannot bear fruit [or is fruitless]1. He who fasts in
the expectation of fruit generally fails.  And even if he does not
seemingly fail, he loses all the inner joy which a true fast holds.
Whether one should take fruit-juice or not depends on one’s
physical powers of endurance. But no more fruit-juice than is absol-
utely necessary for the body should be taken.  He probably has the
greatest inner strength who takes only water.
It is wrong to fast for selfish ends, e. g. for increase in one’s
own salary.  Under certain circumstances it is permissible to fast for an
increase in wages on behalf of one’s group.
Ridiculous fasts spread like plague and are harmful.  But when
fasting becomes a duty, it cannot be given up.  Therefore I do fast
when I consider it to be necessary and cannot abstain from it on any
score.  What I do myself I cannot prevent others from doing under
similar circumstances.  It is common kowledge that the best of good
things are often abused.  We see this happening every day.

April 13, 1946
Today is the last day of the National Week which I have also
called the Sacred Week.  It was on this day that the tragedy of the
Jallianwala Bagh was enacted.  The 6th of April [1919] saw the birth
of satyagraha in India.  The awakening among the masses resulting
from it was so phenomenal that the Government could suppress it
only by having recourse to the method of frightfulness.  It culminated
in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, when Gen. Dyer with a party of fifty
sepoys opened fire on an unarmed people and the wounding of thrice
that number. There was only one exit and it was held by the firing   
party so that the innocent men and women who were trapped there
1 The addressee in his letter had objected to T. Prakasam’s inclusion in the
Cabinet.
2  This was reported under the title “Signs of the Time” by Pyarelal.236 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhad no alternative but to be shot down like rabbits in a hole.  It is true
some excesses were committed by the mob before the massacre. But
they were nothing as compared to the savage reprisals taken  by the
Government.  That is the way of all imperialisms.  In no other way
could a handful of foreigners maintain their rule over a nation of 400
millions.
Why have I recalled these incidents? Not to stir up bitter old
memories or to keep alive the embers of hatred, but only to emphasize
the distinction between the old order which they symbolized and the
new that is in sight.  I have not the slightest doubt as to the bona fides
of the Cabinet Mission.  I am convinced that they have finally made
up their mind to withdraw in toto.  The question which is exercising
their mind is how to effect the withdrawal in an orderly manner and to
that end their energies are bent.  This is not the occasion to rake up
old sores.1 Gentlemanliness requires that if a person is sincerely trying
to make amends, he should be thanked and congratulated for it, not
that his past should be flung in his face.
You know Shri Jayaprakash Narayan and Dr. Lohia2.  Both of
them are daring men of action and scholars.  They could easily have
become rich.  But they chose the way of renunciation and service.  
To break the chains of their country’s slavery was their one passion.
Naturally the alien Government regarded them as dangerous to its
existence and put them into prison.  We, however, have different scales
to weigh merit, and we regard them as patriots who have sacrificed
their all for the love of the country which has given them birth.  That
they would be found wanting in the scales of non-violence is
irrelevant today.  What is relevant is that independence  of  India  is
today common ground between the British and ourselves. Their
freedom, therefore, is no longer considered dangerous by the
Government.  Viewed  in that light, their release as also the release of
the I.N.A. men yesterday, must be regarded as an earnest of the
honesty of the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy.  We must be thankful
to them for this earnest, and prayer of thankfulness should ascend to
heaven for the wisdom with which God seems to be endowing them.
The Satyagraha Week which is closing today is devoted always
to communal unity and khaddar.  Communal unity is not confined to
Hindus and Muslims only, it extends to all including Englishmen.  It

297.  DISCUSSION  WITH  WOODROW  WYATT1
[April 13, 1946 ]2
WOODROW  WYATT :  Do you think we are getting off your backs at last ?
[GANDHIJI : ] I have no doubt as to the sincerity of your intention.
The question is whether you will have the strength and courage
needed for it.  It is so difficult to get out of conventional groves of
thought and action.
We must not precipitate a solution.  We must let India decide for herself.  At
the same time, one does not want to leave the country to chaos when an unprecedented
famine threatens it.
Your difficulty will remain so long as you retain the belief that
your rule that benefited India.  None of us believes it.
One or two have testified to the contrary.
That is neither here nor there.  I too believed it once.  Such
benefit as has really accrued to India is not part of foreign rule but is
the result of contact with a robust people.  The good is incidental, the
evil of foreign rule is inherent and far outweighs the good.  Commual
division in India can be demonstrably proved to be a British creation.
Even famine as we know it today is your creation.3
Mark the true meaning of my words.  Famines may be said to
be godsend.  But a well-equipped country should be able to pull
through a deficiency period and not helplessly succumb.  Famines in
India today are not due to rain or lack of it merely, but due to the fact
that India is ill-equipped to tide over the dry periods.  Nothing has
been done to safeguard her population against the threat of recurring
famines.  Take south Africa.  There they fight against the locusts,
drought, etc., manfully and with infinite resourcefulness.  Here famine
1 The Harijan  report, which appeared under the title “Heart Searching” by
Pyarelal, has been collated with the version in Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase.
2 From The Transfer of Power
3 Here Pyarelal adds : “The last remark startled the visitor; Gandhiji noted the
effect his words had produced.”238 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIis simply blamed on the rain gods, and there is nothing to be done for
it.
Would India have been better equipped, if Britain had not been here ?
Yes, there would have been no railways.1  If there were no
railways, etc., we would be living in a natural state as they used to in
England and Europe in the Middle-Ages when every feudal baron
had his castle with its stocks of grain and water.  Before the advent of
railways in India, every village had its granary.  In that sense we were
better equipped.  Moreover we had our system of domestic crafts to
fall backupon, if crops failed.  Now railways have depleted the
countryside of its stocks and killed the handicrafts.  Whatever cash the
cultivator gets in return for his produce runs through his fingers like
water, thanks to the invasion of his economy by the revenue collector
and the imported foreign goods without which he thinks he can no
longer do.  The British have told him : ‘Do not stock grain, do not
hoard silver.’There is no provision made for a deficit period.
Railways have become a snare, cheap transport, a trap.  The Princes
practised tyranny in olden times too.  But it could not go far. The
natural means of redress, viz. insurrection, retreat or migration, were
still open to the people.  They were not then disarmed or emasculated.
Odds were even.  Today the odds are so heavy that a handful of
British soldiers can terrorize millions.  That is what British rule has
done to us.  It is most domoralizing.  The British must realize this and
leave us in an exemplary manner.  If the virus has gone so deep that it
cannot  be cured without applying a strong blister, even then they
must go.  A few lakhs might be killed in internecine warfare but, real
peace will come at last.
But it is a big responsibility to leave India with anarchy.
Not a bigger responsibility than you were prepared to face
during the war out of strategic cosiderations.2
Supposing we imposed what we considered to be a just solution and went?
All would be upset.
So it must be left to India’s decision ?
1 Here Pyarelal remarks : “This was another shock to the visitor who . . . with
most Westerners regarded railways as the proudest achievement of the British rule in
India to combat famine. . . .”
2 What follows is from The Last Phase .  Pyarelal explains : “Mr. Wyatt
mentioned the difficulty created by the Muslim League’s demand for Pakistan.”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 239Yes, leave it to the Congress and the League. Thanks to Jinnah’s
genius and British co-operation, he had built up a powerful
organization comprehending not all but the major part of the
Muslims.  I will advise you to try him and, if you feel he cannot
deliver the goods, take the Congress into your confidence. . . .  But in
any case the British occupation must end forth with.
And what happens after the British leave ?
Probably there will be arbitration. . . . But there might be a
blood-bath.  It will be settled in two days by non-violence, if I can
persuade India to go my way, or the ordeal may last longer.  Even so
it would not be worse than what it is under the British rule. .. .
Suppose we set up an Interim Government and went ?  . . . .  If the Congress
concedes Pakistan, it will then be their job.
That will be a good beginning.  Even if the whole of India goes
under the League in this way, it won’t matter.  It won’t be the Pakistan
of Jinnah’s conception.  India would then have something to live for
and die for.
Whom shall we put in the place of the present Government?
You can ask the elected legislators to nominate their represen-
tatives. Supposing the Congress has an overwhelming majority, she
will choose the names for the Interim Government.  If the Congress
can   come to terms with the League, there will be no difficulty.  But if
Jinnah should ultimately choose not to come in, Congress and you
must not be frightened.  Or, as I have already said, you let Jinnah
nominate out of the present legislators. Supposing the Muslim League starts
destruction, will you jail them ?
I won’t.  But, maybe, the Congress will decide to fight.  It will
then be a clean fight, not the cowardly hit-and-run that you see today
or taking of a hundred lives for one a la  the British.1

under this title by Anand T. Hingorani, who explains in Preface that, after the death of
his wife Vidya on July 20, 1943, during his eight-week stay in Sevagram from
September 30, 1944, Gandhiji would greet him “every morning, after the prayer . . .
speak words of sympathy and solace, and . . . write down something to meditate upon
. . . From October 13, 1944, onwards, he wrote continuously for a fortnight, and then
off and on . . .” Before leaving Sevagram for nature cure treatment at  Bhimavaram,
Hingorani had requested Gandhiji to write  something for him daily, which Gandhiji
began to do from November 20, 1944.  In June 1946, when Hingorani sought
Gandhiji’s permission to publish the ‘thoughts’ in a book form, Gandhiji remarked :
“What is there about them that you are so keen on publishing them?  If, however, you
wish to publish them, do so after my death.  Such writings are generally never
published during the lifetime of their authors.  Who knows I may not be able to live
up to what I have written!  But if I live up to it till the last breath of my life, then
alone will it be worth while to publish these thoughts.”  Gandhiji, however,
discontinued the practice by the end of 1946, which he explained : “For the sake of
my Noakhali mission, I renounced practically everything . . . I gave up the Ashram,
all my companions and even writing for the Harijan.  So I said to myself, why not
give up writing these daily thoughts as well. . . .”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 241possible must be done to undo the wrong.

Dr.  Katju1 sends the following note2 :
Owing to the comparative failure to winter crops. . . rationing has been
introduced in many urban areas in the United Provinces. . . The Government of
India has suggested to Provincial Governments that in order to ensure
continuous supplies, it would be desirable to  enforce compulsory levies on
agricultural produce in surplus districts. . . This question of a compulsory levy
is greatly agitating the public mind.   It is said that the control price fixed by
the Government is too low and should be  raised.  The answer to that is, that
the price structure is an all-India affair and it is not possible to raise the price
in any particular province without affecting the structure as a whole. . .  There
is bound to be a black market where selfish people can buy foodstuffs at higher
prices to satisfy their individual needs.  No compulsion would be necessary if
cultivators realize that it us their social and patriotic duty to do their utmost to
feed their brothers and sisters. . . I ask you to appeal to him at this  critical
juncture not to hoard, not to sell  in the black market but to supply in the
greatest measure possible to the Government stores. . . We are doing our very
best to  encouragee the ‘Grow More Food’ and ‘Grow More Vegitables’
campaigns in the United Provinces.  The various suggestions3 made by you
have all been adopted. . . .
This note from Dr.  Katju is worthy of close attention by the
kisan4 and his guides as also urban people. The impending calamity
can be turned to good use.  Then it will be a blessing in disguise.  
Otherwise, curse it is and curse it wil remain.
Dr. Katju writes as a responsible minister. Therefore, people      
can either make or mar him. They can remove him and replace him
by a better.  But so long as ministers of the people’s choice are in

300.  INDIAN  PRESSMEN v.  EUROPEAN
An Indian journalist complains that our great men have a
weakness for foreign journalists  to the extent of excluding Indians at
their Press conferences, and wonders whether I am  myself free from
this weakness.  For myself, I can say without fear of contradiction that
I have never been  guilty of such partiality.  Having suffered to good
deal for the crime of  being an Asiatic, I  am not likely to be guilty of
such weakness.  And I must say that I know of no such example as my
friend adverts to, if only because pubic men can ill afford to face a
boycott by Indian Pressmen.  What has happened with me and, so far
as I am aware, with others too is  that they and I  found it necessary at
times to  give special interviews  to foreign journalists when it has been
found necessary in the interest of the common cause to gate messages
across the seas.  It is impossible in the present circumstances to do
otherwise.  It would be as foolish to  invite a boycott by foreign
journalists as by Indian.  Any industrious person will find out that
Indian journalists have been more  often than not preferred by Indian
pubic men again for the sake  of the common cause.  As a fellow
journalist I would urge journalists, whether Indian or foreign, to prefer
their particular causes to their employers’ pockets or to  descending
to recriminations or personalities.

say that the student of Hindi shoud learn Urdu and vice versa .  Then

302.  WHAT  A   KHADI-LOVER   SHOULD  KNOW
The foregoing article3 is full of useful information.  Khadilovers
will not have  read it in vain.
Every day I am getting more and more convinced that we      
should as soon as possible stop  using machine-made slivers.  They
present us from making the villages self-supporting and they will     
surely let us down at the time of real need.  Again, it is not  in            
the least consistent with our way of thinking that these slivers       
should go to or be sold at Madras or Bombay.  Neither the poor            
nor the rich are benefited thereby. The only purpose served is             
that somehow khadi is supplied to those who wear it.  I do not think
that this is the aim of the Charkha Sangh. The experiment being
carried on by Shri Vinoba these days  is signficant and is worth
knowing.  One of his  experiments  eliminates carding.  In the cotton-
growing areas the cotton pods are picked up directly from the fields,
the  shell is removed, the seeds are separated from the cotton with the
help of a roller and the cotton is  spun straightway.   Shri Vinobaji has

Hindi and Urdu, are not translated here.
3 In his letter, not reproduced here, Jugatram Dave had described in detail the
enthusiasm and self-sufficiency of the khadi workers in the Surat district as also the
new experiment of Dilkhush Diwanji.252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcoined the expression punai 1 to denote this  process. But hand-
carding has to be there and wil remain. There also carding is
eliminated, if desired.  This process simplifies the work to a great
extent.  The results so far are encouraging.  The yarn spun by this
process has already been woven.   If this thing works well, much time
and labour will be saved. Whatever the count of yarn that is spun by
this process, it is found to be strong to that extent.  Wherever men like
Shri Diwanji are making experiments we should, I  think watch the
results carefully. Every worker should decide for himself how
speedily these improvements can be introduced in his area.  
As a general rule, machine-carding should cease immediately
and slivers should not be sold beyond the taluka.
The second experiment is to reel the yarn in double thread
before weaving.  This experiment has already proved a  success.  Shri
Vinoba is examining what further improvements are possible in this
direction.  Double-thread reeling is an easy process and all should
learn it. Vinobaji is of the opinion that weaving will become easier and
less costly if people who exchange yarn for cloth will give double-
reeled  yarn.  That means, the yarn reeled in this way can compare
well with mill-yarn.  Such yarn does not need any starching.

303.  QUESTION   BOX2
Q.On what principle is the question of the salaries of ministers in Congress
majoriy provinces going to be settled this time?  Does the Karachi  resolutionin this
regard still hold?  If the question is to be settled on the basis of the present high
prices, is it possible, within the limits of their revenues, for the provincial budgets
to increase the pays of all their servants threefold?  If not, will it be proper for the
ministers to be paid Rs.  1,500 while a chaprasi or a teacher is told to make the two
ends meet on Rs. 15 and 12 p. m.  and not make a fuss about it because Congress has
to run the administration?
1 From puni, meaning a sliver
2  The Hindi original appeared in Harijan Sevak , 21-4-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 253A.The question is apt.  Why should a minister draw Rs. 1,500
and a chaprasi or a teacher Rs. 15 p. m.?  But the question cannot  be
solved by the mere raising of it.  Such differences have existed for
ages.  Why shoud an elephant require an enormous quantity of food
and a mere grain suffice for the ant?  The question carries its own
answer.  God gives to each one according to his need.  If we could as
definitely know the variations in the needs of men as those of the
elephant and the ant, no doubts would arise.  Experience tells us that
differences in requirements do exist in society1 .  But we do not know
the law governing them.  All therefore that is possible today is to try
to reduce the differences as far as possible.  The reduction can be
brought about by  peacefu agitation and by  the creation of public
opinion.  It cannot be done by force or by duragraha  in the name of
satyagraha.  The ministers are the people’s men.  Their wants even
before they took office were not those of  chaprasis .  I would love to
see a chaprasi become worthy of holding the office of a minister and
yet not increase his needs.  It should also be clearly understood that
no minister need draw up  to the maximum of the salary fixed.
It is worth while pondering over one thing that arise out of      
the questions.  Is it possible for the chaprasi to support himself           
and his family on Rs. 15 p. m. without taking bribe?  Should he          
not be given enough to keep him above temptation?  The remedy for
this is that as far as  possible we should we our own chaprasis .  But
even so if we need them we must pay them enough for their
requirements.  In this way the big gulf that exists between a minister
and a chaprasi will be bridged.
It is another matter as to   why the pay of the ministers has been
raised from Rs.  500 to 1,500 p.m. But this is nothing as compared
with, and does not solve, the main problem. With the solution of the
latter it will ipso facto   be solved.

305.  “ROMAN  URDU”
If there is Roman Urdu, why nat Roman Hindi?  The next step
will be to Romanize the alphabets of all the languages of India.  They
have done this for Zulu which had no alphabet of its own. The attempt
in India would be  on a par with the attempt to foist Esperanto on the
world.  It cannot succeed in the near future.  Believers in the Roman
script in the place of all the known Indian scripts will have a circle of
adherents but the movement cannot permeate the masses.  It should
not.  Crores of people need not become so lazy as not to learn their
own respective scripts. A laudable attempt is being made not to
replace the alphabets in vogue in India but to teach Nagari in addition
in the hope that in course of time millions may learn to read the
Indian languages in  the Nagari character.  And since Urdu characters
cannot for well-known reasons be replaced by Nagari, it should be
learnt by all the patriots who love their country too well to find the
learning of the Urdu alphabet a burden.  All these attempts seem to
me to be worthy.
With all my readiness to grasp new ideas, I have failed to find a
substantial reason for inducing the spread of the Roman alphabet for
the purpose of replacing the Nagari or Urdu script. It is true that in
the Indian Army, the Roman alphabet has  been largely used.  I
should hope that the Indian soldier, if he is saturated with the national
spirit , will not mind learning both Nagari and Urdu charachers. After
all, amid the ocean of Indian humanity, the Indian soldier is a mere
drop. He must shed the Eng-lish mode. Probably the reason for
Romanizing Urdu will be found in the English officer being too lazy
to learn to read Urdu or Nagari characters.

NEW  DELHI,
April 15, 1946
Shri Prakasam2 I have known as a worker for many years. He
has somehow developed a philosophy that a public worker is entitled
to receive purses from the public for his expenses.  In pursuance of
that phiosophy he has received a considerable sum in the shape of
purses.  Those who  collected them have wired or written to me that
they saw nothing wrong in so doing or in Shri Prakasam receiving
them.  Some have gone so far as to say that Shri Prakasam should
even became a member of the Madras ministry, if not the Prime
Minister.
With the greatest reluctance I must dissent from the whole view.
I know that Shri Prakasam says that he has changed his mind.  Sudden
conversions  are not unknown.  But they are cast in a different mould.
A ministership cannot be the end of genuine repentance and
conversion.  My advice to Shri Prakasam is that he should retire even
from the Legislative Assembly and brood over the bad example he
has set.  There is ample field open to everyone for silent service which
is often much greater than service done  in the limelight.

Sweepers’ grievances come in this category.  I do not want to go into
others here.  My opinion against sweepers’ strikes  dates back to
about 1897 when I was4 in Durban.  A general strike was mooted there
and the question arose as to whether scavengers should join in it.  My
vote was registered against the proposal.  Just as man cannot live

surroundings are not clean.  One or other epidemic is bound to break
out especially when modern drainage is put out of action.
Therefore I was perturbed when I read about the sweepers’
strike in Bombay.  Fortunately it has come  to an end.  I understand,
however, that the sweepers, both men and women, refused to submit
their case to  arbitration.1
In spite of my close attachment   to sweepers, better because of
it, I must denounce the coercive methods they are said to  have
employed.  They will thereby be losers in the long run. City folk will
not always be cowed down.  If they were, it would mean the collapse
of municipal administration.  Coercion cannot but result in the end in
chaos.  An impartial tribunal for settling disputes should always be
accepted.  Refusal is a sign of weakness.  A Bhangi may not give up
his work even for a day.  And there are many other ways open to him
of securing justice.
Towns people should on the other hand, forget that  there is    
such a thing as untouchability and learn the art of cleaning their  own      
and the city’s drains, so that if a similar occasion arises they are         
not nonplussed and can render the necessary temporary service.  They
may not be coerced.  I go so far as to say that the military  who know
this work should be used for such emergency. If swaraj is round the
bend, we can now look  upon the military as ours and need have no
hesitation in taking all the constructive work we can from them.  Up    
till now they have only been employed in indiscriminate firing on us.
Today they must plough the land, dig wells, clean latrines and do
every other constructive work that they can, and thus turn the people’s
hatred of them into love.
Now that the hartal 2 is at an end, it is the duty of everyone, to
stretch out the hand of fellowship to the Bhangis,  educate them,  see
that they are properly housed, permit them, like anyone  else,  to live
wherever they choose, look into the matter of an equitable wage for
them and see that justice is meted out to them without their having to

had their demand accepted without obtaining a decision as to its propriety or
otherwise.”

ourselves worthy of swaraj and be able also to maintain it.

CHI. MATHURADAS,
I have instructed Rajkumari to reply to your letters. I cannot
even write letters, because there is no time.
I have been thinking about Dilip. I have talked over the matter. I
had a long talk with Usha’s father as well. I feel the girl is nice. I even
had a talk with her. The father says that the boy and the girl may meet
and marry if they feel so inclined. As I am writing this, Sushila gives
me your letter. Seeing that your letter is in English, it occurs to me
that the matter should be kept from Delhi. I find the talk of dark and
fair irksome. And I would not be happy if the decision to marry was
guided by consideration of external beauty. Now you may do
whatever you think fit. We should not do anything by which the father
and daughter may be left in the lurch. Hence write to me a prompt
reply.
Are you still having allergy rashes or have they subsided ?

311.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER   MEETING2
April 15, 19463
In a moment of introspection the poet asks himself:
O man, why have you left off taking God’s name?  You
have not given up anger or lust or greed, but you have forgotton
truth.  What a tragedy to save worthless pennies and to  let go
the priceless gem of God’s love! Why would you not, O fool,
renounce all vanities and throw yourself on the grace of God
alone?
This does not mean that if one has  wealth, it should be thrown
away and wife and children should be turned  out of doors.  It simply
means that  one must give up attachment to these things and dedicate
one’s all to God and make use of His gifts to serve Him only.  It also
means that if we take His name with all our being we are automatically
weaned from all lust, untruth and baser passions.

Baba Raghavadas; hailed from Konkan but settled down in Gorakhpur; joined
Congress in 1920; established various institutions  for social, moral uplift of the
people; started Geeta Press  at Gorakhpur.
The addressee, who had just been released from  jail, met Gandhiji and apprised
him of the scramble for power among Congressmen.  It being his silence day
Gandhiji replied in writing.
2 Reproduced from Pyarelal’s report “Prayer Discourses”
3 From The Hindustan Times,  16-4-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 259In the first shloka 1 of Ishopanishad  that is repeated every day at
the beginning of the prayer, one is asked to dedicate everything to
God and then use it to the required extent.  The principal condition
laid down is that one must not covet what belongs to another.  These
two maxims contain the quintessence of the Hindu religion.
In another shloka  which is recited during the morning prayer it
is said:
I do not ask for temporal power, nor do I ask  to go to
heaven, nor  even to attain nirvana2 .  What I ask for is that I
may be able to relieve the pain of  those who are in pain.
The pain might be physical, mental or spiritual.  Spiritual pain
due to slavery to one’s passions is sometimes greater even than
physical.
But God does not come down in person to relieve suffering.  He
works through human agency.  Therefore, prayer to God to enable
one to relieve the sufferings of others must mean a longing and
readiness on one’s part to labour for it.
The prayer, you will note, is not  exclusive.  It is not restricted to
one’s own caste or community.  It is all-inclusive.  It comprehends the
whole of humanity.  Its realization would thus mean the establishment
of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.

Gandhiji’s reply covered not only the I. N. A. but all Indian army men.
Although the I. N. A. men had declared open rebellion under Netaji’s5 lead                   
the spirit of rebellion was not confined to them.  It  had permeated even the

5 Subhas Chandra Bose (1897-1945); General Secretary of the Indian National
Congress, 1927, its President, 1938 and 1939; resigned from Congress and founded

National Army.260 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIndian Army ranks. Some of the latter had seen him at Poona and sought                     
his advice1 .  Gandhiji had told them that it was open to them to give notice to the
authorities that  though they were in their pay their loyalty was mortgaged to India,
not to the King of England.  Hitherto they had yielded obedience to military orders
and been prepared even to shoot down their countrymen to order.  But now that the
spirit of independence had taken possession of them they would do so no more under a
foreign Government’s order.
For the I. N. A. men theref were two alternatives.  They could serve free India
as soldiers-in-arms or  they could convert themselves into soldiers of  non-violence if
they were convinced that non-violence was the higher and the more efficacious way.
They should make use of their training and discipline to introduce non-violent
organization among the masses, learn spinning and become veteran constructive
workers.  If they did that, they would set a glorious example to the whole world.
The I. N. A. men  have shown great strength, heroism and
resourcefulnes.  But I must confess that their achievements have not
dazzled my eyes.  To die without killing requires more heroism.
There is nothing very wonderful in killing and being killed in the
process.  But the man who offers his neck to the enemy for execution
but refuses to bend to his will shows courage of a far higher  type.
Troublous times lie ahead of us.  Our non-violence has broght
us o the gate of independence.  Shall we renounce it after we have
entered that gate?  I for one am firmly convinced that non-violence of
the brave, such as I have envisaged, provides the surest and the most
efficacious means to face foreign aggression and internal disorder just
as it has done for winning independence.
The British were going to quit.  What place would India have in the comity of
nations?  Would she be satisfied with being a fifth-rate power like China? China was
independence only in name.  India would have long to wait before she could become a
first-class military power.
And for that she would have to go under the tutelage of some
Western power.  A trully non-violent India will have nothing to fear
any foreign power nor will it look to British navy and air force for
her defence.  I know that we have not as yet the non-violence of the
brave.

April 16, 1946
Speaking after prayers on Tuesday evening Gandhiji  explained the meaning of
swadeshi.  It  hurt him deeply to see that after 25 years of repeeated exhortations the
people had still not taken to swadeshi.  Some people regarded Indian mill cloth as
swadeshi.   In his opinion, khadi alone was real swadeshi.  The machinery in the mills
was not made in India.  Supposing in a free India they had their own engineers and
were able to produce the machinery in India, he would still not call it  swadeshi.  He
did not want anything that might ruin the villages.  Honest servants of the people
would devote themselves to the service of the villages and to that purpose become
poor with the poorest. 
Gandhiji expected all of them to take at  least to  khadi.  What was the use of
their attending the prayers, if they did not follow what they heard there?  He had cried
himself hoarse over khadi for  the last 25 years.  But his non-violence taught him that
he was to go on proclaiming what he considered to be the truth.  It was not for him to
lose temper or feel disappointed if the people did not listen to him.
They might well ask him how they were to wear khadi when they could not get
it in the khadi bhandars.  Lack of khadi in the bhandars was of his doing.  Just as
foreign cloth even if it appeared to be cheap was not cheap in reality, similarly khadi
produced at one place and sold at another could not serve the purpose that it was
intended to serve.  It was no use their wearing khadi without grasping the spirit
behind it.  Khadi had been called the livery of swaraj. It gave the wearer a certain
respectable status. 
 But if khadi was to be the symbol of non-violence and the livery of swaraj it
had to be produced and used locally.  Therefore he had asked the bhandars not to
import khadi from other provinces.  He had also asked them to sell it in exchange for
yarn and to see that those who span for wages also wore khadi themselves.  They were
not to accept the yarn from those spinners who  span for   wages but  did not wear
khadi themselves even though it might result in a temporary shortage of khadi.
People were taking to the idea, but during the transition stage, some inconvenience
might be experienced.  The remedy was that they should spin for themselves and  even
engage handloom-weavers for weaving khaddar.  There were many rich people in
Delhi who could easily undertake this work.

No matter from what infectious disease a patient may be
suffering, if  the tub has been cleaned with burning-hot ash after that
patient has bathed in it, I would, if asked, unhesitatingly bathe in it.
For breakfast, I think it will be better if you eat home-made crisp
biscuits which require to be chewed, together with fruit, instead of
eating ghensh3. This may be followed with  milk. Or you may drink
milk  at noon.  This is only by way of suggestion. I am glad that Joshi

April 17, 19462
It was the fault of the parents, Gandhiji remarked.3 He had never seen children
playing in a church or a mosque.
True culture requires that there should be perfect peace in the
prayer ground at the time of the  prayer.
There should be an atmosphere of solemnity as in a church, a  mosque or a
temple. He knew that many of the temples  were full of clamour. It had hurt him
deeply.
We go to the temple to worship not the stone or the metal image
but God who resides in it.  The image becomes what man makes of it.
It has no power independently of the sancitity with which it is invested
by the worshipper. Therefore everyone, including children, should
observe perfect silence at the time of prayer.4

Death has removed not  only from us but from the  world one
of India’s best sons.5  That he loved India passionately, everyone who
knew him could see.  When I saw him last in Madrass, he could talk of
nothing but India and her culture for which he lived and died.6  I am
sure that he had no thought  of himself even when he seemed to be on
his  death-bed. His Sanskrit  learning was as great if no greater than
his English. I must not permit myself to say more, save this that
though we differed in politics, our hearts were one and I  could never
think that his patriotism was less than that of the tallet patriot.   Sastri
the man lives though his body is  reduced to ashes.

HARIJAN MANDIR,
NEW DELHI,
April 18, 1946
DEAR PRAKASAM,
I wrote the enclosed note1 for Harijan. It absolutely represents
my confirmed view which I told you personally. But the members of
the Working Committee were here last night, among them Pandit
Nehru and others. They had seen a copy of my note and they all
thought that I should not publish it. I defended it strenuously but on
turning it over in my mind last night I came to the conclusion that I
would be taking perhaps an undue advantage of my public position to
air my personal view. Instead, therefore,  of allowing the note to be
published in Harijan, I feel I should satisfy my conscience by sending
a copy to you and letting you make what use you like of it. I would,
however, like to emphasize the fact that if you allow yourself to be
chosen as Prime Minister or hold any office or even be a member of
Parliament, it will be bad for the country and of course for yourself.
As I have said in the note, it will be apparent to you that your
reconsideration against your minstership of your philosophy will be
perfectly valueless and ludicrous.
Yours,

from Krishnachandra’s letter today that you are likely to have

I have carefully gone through your writing on the Roman script.
I appreciate  the pains you have taken over it and also the erudition
that is behind it.  But the thing does  not seem to me to be opportune.
We are not immediately  seized of the subject. If it is being discussed
the discus-sions  are confined to pundits. I see no use of it for the
people.  Besides,  I have already expressed  a contrary opinion,4 which
has nothing to do with your pamphlet.  It was with reference  to a

April 18, 1946
You would have covered me with shame if you  had come to me
instead of my going to you.
Why do you lend a ready ear to such gossip?2  Why can’t you
take a leaf out of my book?  If someone comes to me and talks to  me
about the Indian States, I send him off to Pandit Nehru. If it is about
internal politics of the Congress, I  give him Azad’s address.  In this
way I have rigorously restricted my ambit of work.  Even so, I have
hardly a moment’s respite. Unless I did that would have to give up the
desire to live up to the age of 125 which I must not  do, if any dream
of non-violence as a world-conquering force is to be realized. You are
a man of religion and purity of soul. It should need no  argument on
my part to convince you that if you completely empty your mind of
outward things and fixing all  your thoughts on Him inwardly pray,
you will have more than contributed your share to the struggle for
independence. You must complete your century. It is perfectly
feasible if you will listen to my advice.

you in talk any further,” he remarked, “I know you are always busy.“

326.  SPEECH  AT   PRAYER  MEETING3
April 18, 19464
As a result of his remarks5 children had ceased to play about in the prayer
ground today and this quick response from parents and children evoked
congratulations from Gandhiji and he emphasized the necessity of children coming to
prayers in clean clothes and with clean bodies.  Next he drew their attention to the
growing number of newspapers and the undue importance that was being attached to
1 Reporting this in his article “Young at Eighty-five ” Pyarelal writes: “On
reaching Delhi he wanted to come and see Gandhiji in Bhangi Nivas, but Gandhiji
anticipated him by meeting him at 5, Canning Road.”
2 Gandhiji had heared that a lot of people came and disturbed Malaviyaji’s
peace by retailing all kinds of idle rumours.

The newspaper man has become a walking plague. In the East         
as in  the West newspapers are fast becoming the people’s Bible,   
Koran, Zend Avesta and Bhagavad Gita,  rolled into one. All that
appear in the  papers is looked upon as God’s truth.  For instance, a
peper predicts that riots are coming, that all the stricks and knives in        
Delhi have been sold out and the news throws everybody into a panic.
That is bed.  Another newspaper reports the occurrence of riot  here    
and there and blames the police of taking sides with the Hindus in one
place and the Muslims in  another.  Again, the man in the street  is
upset.  I want you all to shed this craven fear.  It is not becoming of
men and women, who believe in God and take part in the  prayers, to
be afraid of anyone.
What if riots do actually take place and some people get       
killed?  Everyone must die  one day. I will expect you to go in          
the midst of the fracas and tell the rowdies to be sensible. A friend
remarked in the course of the conversation the other day that whilst it
was poor rowdies that killed and got killed in the riots, the real
responsibility lay not with them but with educatad people, real
responsibility lay not with them but with educated people, some of
them occupying respectable places in society.  It  is they who incite
others to violence from behind the scenes.  It is for these educated and
cultured people to stop the  riots by laying down their lives  in the
process if necessary.  Even a  little girl can go up to the hooligans and
tell them to desist.  Most probably they will.  But supposing they do
not and kill her, it will be well with her all the same. She will live
through her pure sacrifice.  It is always well with those who believe in
God and try to do His will to the best of their ability.
Independence is coming.  But our lungs appear to have lost the
capacity to breathe the air freedom.  But when freedom actually
comes, you will find that the loss of the capacity was only apparent.
Maybe, the first impact of freedom will give you a rude shock, and
before you regain your equilibrium some undesirable things might
take place.  All that you need to do is to keep yourselves on the alert
and undaunted and it will be well with you in the end.

[Before April 19, 1946 ]2
In talking to a friend the other day who was suggesting an expedient to     
solve the political tangle, contrary to his inner conviction of the wrong of it,
Gandhiji told him that it was unworthy for a man of faith ever to believe                  
that anything but evil could be born out of a poisonous germ.  The friend         
replied, “The Cross was poisonous, full of hatred and ill will and yet redemption
camed out of it.”
That is not my interpretation of the Cross.  There was no poison
there, no hatred, no fear. It was the way of self-suffering and therefore
of love and hence the story of redemption.
Harijan, 28-4-1946
328.  SOVEREIGN  REMEDY
. . . Your new note in nature cure—reciting of Ramanama as the sure
remedy—leaves me completely bewildered.  The modern youth refrains from
challenging some of your views out of toleration.  Their attitude may be
summed up in the following : ‘Well, Gandhiji has taught us a whole lot of
things; he has elevated us to unimaginable heights; he has, above all, brought
swaraj within our reach; why not ‘suffer’ his Ramanama ‘fad’?
Inter alia you have said the following :
“No matter what the ailment from which a man may be suffering,
recitation of Ramanama from the heart is the sure cure” ( Harijan,   3-3-’46)3
“Man should seek out and be content to confine he means of cure to the
five elements of which the body is composed, i. e., earth, water, akasha4, sun
and air” ( Harijan, 3-3-’46).5
“And my claim is that the recitation of Ramanama is a sovereign
remedy for our physical ailments also” ( Harijan, 7-4-’46).6
At first, when you introduced this new note in the system of nature cure, I
thought you were merely putting in other words a kind of psycho-therapy or
Christian Science based on faith. . . .  I interpreted my first quotation above in
that light.  The second sentence quoted above is difficult to grasp.  After all, it

6 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting, Bombay”, 15-3-1946272 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIis physically impossible for medicines to be composed of anything but the
five elements to which you refer, and which you say must be the sole means of
cure.
If faith is what you insist on I have no quarrel; it is necessary for the
patient to co-operate in getting well also by faith.  But it is difficult to accept
that faith alone would cure “our physical ailment also”.  Two years ago, my
little daughter was struck by infantile paralysis; it was the most modern
treatment that saved the child from becoming a cripple for life.  You would
agree that it would not avail to ask a two-and-a-half-year-old child to recite
Ramanama to be rid of infantile paralysis; and I would like to see you persuade
any mother to do the recitation (and recitation alone) on her child’s behalf.
The authority from Charka1 that you have quoted in the issue of March
24,2 leaves me cold; you have taught me not to accept anything, however
ancient and however authoritative it may be, if it does not appeal to my heart.
Thus writes a teacher of youth.3  While I am eager to be in the
good graces of the student world, my eagerness has well-defined
limitations.  For one, I must please them with the rest of the world,
which is admittedly much larger.  In no case should a servant of the
public pander to any person or class.
If those whom my correspondent represents really think that
anything I have done has taken India to unimaginable heights, they
should extend to my so-called fads slightly more than toleration.
Toleration by itself will do them and me no good.  It may easily
promote lazineses in them, and false self-assurance in me.  Let them
think well before rejecting even a fad.  Faddists are not always to be
despised.  Fads have before now made owners mount the gallows.
Ramanama has the flavour of faith-healing and Christian
Science; yet, it is quite distinct from them.  Recitation of Ramanama is
a mere symbol of the reality for which it stands.  If one of knowingly
filled with the presence of God within, one is that moment free from
all ailments, physical, mental or moral.  That we do not see the type in
life is not to disprove the truth of the statement.  My argument is
admittedly useless for those who have no faith in God.
Christian scientists, faith-healers and psychotherapists may, if
they will, bear witness somewhat to the truth underlying Ramanama.  I
cannot take the reader a long way with me through reason.  How is
one to prove to a person who has never tasted sugar, that sugar is
sweet, except by asking him to taste it?
I must not reiterate here the conditions attendant upon the heart

3 Only excerpts from the letter are reproduced here.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 273recitation of the sacred syllable.
The authority of Charka is good for those who have some belief
in Ramanama. Other may dismiss the authority from their consi-
deration.
Children are irresponsible.  Ramanama is undoubtedly not for
them.  They are helpless beings at the mercy of their parents.   They
show what tremendous responsibility parents bear to them and society.
I have known parents who have trifled with their children’s diseases
even to the extent  of trusting them to their (the parent’s) recitation of
Ramanama.
Lastly, the argument about everything, even medicines, being
from panch mahabhutas1 betrays a hasty confusion of thought. I have
only to point it out to remove it.

DELHI,
April 19, 1946
CHI.  BHANSALI,
I have gone through your letter three times—twice word by
word and the third time for dictating a  reply.  By clinging to the letter
of the pledge we often come to observe it only in form.  The spirit is
the  real thing which alone makes us aware of our understanding of it.
Flawless observance is possible only after we achieve a harmonious
blend of the letter and the  spirit.  It has always been painful to me
because I have expressed such an opinion in the context of my vow      
to abjure milk. I see there is a subtle pride in being content with        
the observance of a vow in its spirit. I therefore do not deceive    
myself. Literally according to my vow I gave up animal milk for      
all time, but since by milk is generally meant buffalo’s or cow’s     
milk and also because at the time of taking the vow I was not at all  
aware of any other milk, I took advantage of my own ignorance and
started taking goat’s milk. Even then it did hurt my soul but some
how I consoled my mind.  Had I been able to stick to my resolve of
abjuring all animal milk, possibly I might have been freed of this
body. Nevertheless, my heart bears testimony to the fact that I have
fulfilled  my vow in letter as well as in spirit.  If I were to apply the
same rule to you, and I ought to, you should observe your pledge
literally and  stick to the Ashram.  And by staying on you will also be
observing it  in spirit.
Whereas other people felt that  the movement1 had been in vain I
never had any such feeling.  Failure has no place in the vocabulary of
satyagraha. Satyagraha has endless time [to operate]. It may not
therefore care for [any outside] help.  There is much more to it than I
have said here.  If I begin to expound it I will have to devote a lot of
time to it, which you also would not want me to do.   Let me therefore
be quite having shown you what your dhrama is.

336.  SPEECH   AT  PRAYER   MEETING
April 19, 1946
Speaking after prayers on Friday, Gandhiji referred to his latest love—nature
cure.  He had believed in it  for years.  He felt that what he had  shared with his     
freind and close associates so far should be shared with the masses poor villagers.       
He had been thinking of the villagers in particular in connection with the      
Kasturba2  work.
Medical help had become an elaborate and costly affair nowadays.  Those who
could afford it called in a doctor who wrote out a prescription in a language
unintelligible to the layman.  The latter carried the prescription to the chemist, took
the medicine and counted upon it to cure him.  Apart from the utility of this method of
treatment, it  was beyond the reach of the masses.
During his recent tour of Bengal and Madras lots of people had joined the
prayers and in the mass singing of Ramdhun .  He had since introduced Ramanama in
1 The addressee’s second, to Gangi.  His first wife, Vidya, had passed away in
1944.
2 Kasturba  Gandhi National Memorial Trust278 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHInature cure as a panacea for all ailments whether physical, mental or spiritual.
Physical ailments, Gandhiji continued, were not always the most serious.
Those born of anger, lust, greed, infatuation, etc., were worse.  
Bad as is the loss of a limb, the loss of reason would be worse.
Ramanama when it is uttered not merely by the lips but proceeds from
the heart is the sovereign remedy for the triple woes1 to which man is
subject.  Reason follows the heart.  It does not guide it.  A pure heart
is thus the most essential requisite not only for mental health but for
physical too, and that could be had only through waiting on God—
repeating Ramanama.
No remedy on earth, Mahatma Gandhi proceeded, could cure all physical
ailments.  But Ramanama enabled one to put up with suffering bravely and calmly
when it could not cure.  Ramanama also stood for the natural and right way of living.
That was why he had taken to nature cure in the evening of his life and thereby added
another to his numerous burdens.

337.  TALK  WITH  S.  A.  AYER2
[Before  April 20, 1946 ]3
Shri S. A. Ayer of the Azad Hind Government came to discuss with Gandhiji
the other day the question of issuing a news bulletin in the Roman script for the I. N.
A. as proposed by the central I. N. A. Relief Committee. . .. “The men had got used to
the Roman script while they were in the Indian Army and so retained it when they
were operating in South East Asia.”
You forget that you are not working  in South East Asia today,
but in India.  May I ask if these men ever write to their wives and
children in the Roman script?
Never, they write one and all in Hindi, Urdu, Tamil or any of  the other Indian
scripts.
This means that they all know one or the other Indian script.  I
could understand your wanting to adopt the Roman script as a
temporary makeshift if we had no script of our own.  But to adopt the
Roman script for Hindustani which has got two acknowledged scripts
1 Viz., physical, mental and spiritual
2 Reproduced from Pyarelal’s report entitled “Cultural Conquest and Roman
Script” dated “New Delhi, April 20, 1946”
3 ibidVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 279is only a sign of the psychological conquest that the English have
made over us.   In order to conquer the English who had conquered
you, you adopted the English garb, i. e., Roman script,  for your
bulletins in South East Asia.  You should have discarded this symbol
of the cultural conquest and insisted on having your bulletin in the
two Indian scripts rather than in Roman.  The latter was primarilly
adopted for the sake of the British officers and men who had to learn
Hindustani in order to rule over us. They solved the difficulty
presented by the permutations and combinations of the Urdu alphabet
and tempted us by their typerwriters, telegraph and printing machines
which use Roman script.  We succumbed.  We may not hark back to
the symbol of our cultural conques when we are out to end India’s
slavery in toto.  When you served in the British army it was with the
prospect of getting rewards in the form of decorations, comfortable
pay and pensions, grants of land, etc. But now you don’t want such
temptations.  You serve only for the independence and honour of
your country.  You do not want the easy way.
India will soon have independence.  Do not think that there will
be one script for Hindustani all at once.  It will come when you  and I
have honestly and diligently learnt both the scripts—not before.  That
is the least price we have to pay for independence.
In support of his argument he cited the parallel of South Africa where they
have everything in two languages.  The Government gazette is published in two
languages and so are the textbooks for use in schools.
And it is not called partition, but Union of South Africa.  To
maintain this union they have four capitals one for each province.
That is the way of a free and freedom-living people.
Shri Ayer agreed and said, “We shall have the Hindustani bulletin in Nagari and
Urdu scripts, not in Roman.

338.  GOSHALAS  AND  PINJRAPOLES
The following condensation from a scheme propounded by
Sardar Sir Datar Singh1 will be of general interest:
It is estimated that there are at present 3,000 goshalas in
the country with a population of over six lakh head of cattle.
These organizations, besides taking up the improvement of their
institutions as envisaged by the Government of India, in the
1 Agricultural  expert and pioneer of animal husbandry in the Punjab280 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIpresent threatened famine conditions can come to the country’s
help by production of more milk in the institutions. The
number of  well-organized gashalas and pinjrapoles  can be
taken as half, i. e., 1,500.  The cattle may be classified as:
1.Good dairy type 20% 1,20,000
2.Fair type—good for breeding, though not
highly productive 20% 1,20,000
3.Old, infirm  and unfit for further breeding 60% 3,60,000
It is the first and second class that could be exploited for
milk production and breeding.  Out of these 2,40,000
half will be milch and half dry.
Better feeding, management, organization, etc., would
mean an increase in production of 1,20,000 seers or, say, 3,000
maunds of milk per day.
In order to achieve this end immediately, a skeleton plan is
suggested below:
1.Productive animals should be separated from those
that are aged, infirm or otherwise useless. The latter should be
removed to rural areas, preferably to forest rakhs 1 in order to
relieve congestion and allow better feeding of productive. Their
care, as well as that of dry stock farms, may be in the hands of a
committee.
2.For the achievement of this end, the stock should be
divided in the following manner:
a.Milch animals about to calve should be kept at the
goshala premises.
b.Dry animals fit for breeding should be kept on the
lands,  if any, belonging to the goshala in the neighbourhood or
may provided for at  a place from where they could be returned
when about to calve, and the animals which go dry in the
goshala, should be sent there.
3.The congestion relieved,  goshalas  and pinjrapoles
will have enough space to house cattle properly, feed  them
scientifically and carry out other improvements.
4.To further help, encourage and stimulate these
institutions in this direction, it is suggested to help them
financially by giving them 50% reduction on concentrates and
fodder on the condition that these institution will increase their
1 ReservesVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 281milk production immediately either by keeping milch cattle of
the owners who not able to keep  them during the famine days
or bybuying cattle where their finances permit. The Government
will have the option of purchasing one-third of their milk
supply for the needy people of the locality and in the
neighbourhood, if required.
5.Attempts should be made  to feed cattle more on feeds
which are not generally required for direct human consumption
such as oil-cakes, cotton seeds, etc.
6.It may also be stated here that by feeding by-products
of grains to the cattle, not only can the production of available
food be increased the form of additional milk from these
animals as compared to the food value of these by-products of
food in case they are directly consumed, but it will also be more
economical method of using the latter.  Within limits, it will have
double effect.  It will help in the production of human food and
will also protect the cattle from being underfed during the
scarcity period.
 7.All possible facilities should be provided for transport
and supply of concentrates and other cattle-feeds to these
institutions. Collection of data as to the requirements of the
goshalas and the available stocks in these organizations should
immediatey be taken in hand.  Provision should be made well in
advance for the supply of these essential requirements from
surplus to deficit zones. All this must be done in advance
through Goshala Development Officers, who will be responsible
for the working of the whole scheme.
The Sardar suggests to every province the appointment of
Goshala Development Officers, training of workers and the supply of
bulls.  He rightly says that for real success there must be genuine co-
operation between Government and the public. He has no doubt that
goshalas, humanitarian and cattle welfare and such other bodies will
give the co-operation if approached.
Another friend of cattle writes as follows: 1
I want you to consider one or two suggestions for saving our cattle
during the coming famine. . . .
My concrete suggestion is that well-to-do people.. . should be
generous enough to permit cattle belonging to less fortunate people to graze
1 Only excerpts from the letter are reproduced here.282 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIin their compounds.
Provincial government should establish a chain of goshalas  where
owners of cattle, who are unable to maintain them during the period of famine,
may leave them to be fed and maintained at State expense unitl the crisis is
over.

Centre bent upon meeting the crisis and inspiring the masses with
confidence.

‘SILK KHADI’
If particle  payment in yarn is necessary for buying cotton khadi why shoud
the same not apply to ‘silk khadi’?
There can be only one answer to this question.   Silk khadi too
is khadi and its purchase should, therefore, also be contingent on the
requisite payment of yarn.
WHY  ONLY  YARN?
Since spinning is a part of the constructive programme, why should not all
constructive workers be exempt from paying for khadi in yarn?
There is some confusion of thought in this question.The      
reason for part payment in yarn, instead of in money, is to give khadi     
its rightful place, and in time make yarn current coin.  That yarn is a
part of the constructive work has no bearing on the present argument.  
Let us leave aside for the moment the fact that the wheel is the central
1 In the article, not reproduced here, Sushila Nayyar had suggested how the
research institutions could help ward off the famine by “finding out alternative food”,
“efficient husbanding of the available food resources” and  proper storge of grain and
by working out austerity meals.

that swaraj hangs by the hand-spun thread, then it is clear that the    
value of yarn will be far greater than glad and silver currency.
Constructive workers are not exempt from spinning.  How can there
be any such exemption from yajna?  Spinning is the necessary yajna
for everyone.

an advantage for us to be there?  Will not such work as we want done be        
done in one session of the legislature, whereas ordinarily it would take       
years to do?
So writes a sister.  But there seem to be three flaws in her line of
argument.
Firstly, I have not made any distinction between the present and
the future Assembly under swaraj.  It is unnecessary for my argument.
Secondly, it is an illusion to think that M. L. A.s are the guides
of the voters.  Voters do not send representatives to the Assemblies in
order to be guided by them.  On the contrary, they are sent there
loyally to carry out the people’s wishes.  The people are, therefore,
the guides, not the M. L. A.s. The latter are servants, the former
masters. The illusion is due to the present system of government.
When the   illusion disappears, the existing unseemly comptition to get
into the legislature will also be much less.  There will be a few whose
duty it will be to go there, and they will go to do the people’s will.
Today  they go to the Assembly in order to fight there for swaraj, but
it has  now dawned on most people that they cannot achieve much
there even in this line.
The third mistake in the argument is that Assemblies are best
fitted to guide the people. If we look around the world we shall find

rot  would set in all governments, because the field for guidance is vast
and the Assembly is a very small thing. Parliaments are, after all, a
mere drop in the ocean of national life.

With regard to a Press report in which Mahatma Gandhi was reported                 
to have stated that the Madras Congress Legislature Party was free to electany leader it
liked and he had no objection to  Mr.  Prakasam of anybody  being elected leader,
Gandhiji stated today  that he said nothing of the   kind to anybody but he had written
a private letter to Mr.  prakasam, which Mr.  Prakasam was at liberty to publish and
which should be read out to the persons concerned in case of doubt.3

Your letter is good but it is next to impossible for me to go
anywhere for the present. Once the work here is finished I shall have
to go directly to Poona. I am not in a condition any more to break
journey anywhere on the way. The best course for you would be to
read and ponder what I have written and then put into effect as much
of it as you can digest in your own life and in the affairs of your state.
The moment Ramarajya  has been established in Awagarh, I am
certain it will attract me like a magnet. You should also have that faith.
Yours sincerely,

MAULANA SAHEB,
Read the enclosed clippings. Whatever is written about me is
without foundation. I have not expressed my opinion to anybody.
When one or two members of the Committee asked me about it I told
them that it is not proper to have the same president. In fact I feel
unhappy that a Muslim should remain president at this juncture. If
you agree with this view I would like you to read the enclosed
clippings. You should issue a statement announcing that you do not
wish to remain the president. It would be appropriate if some other
person becomes the president. Badshah Khan’s name had already
been proposed but I strongly opposed it. I even had a discussion with
Badshah Khan.
If my opinion were sought this time, I would prefer Jawaharlal.
There are several reasons for it. I do not want to go into them.
Yours,
M. K. G ANDHI

April 20, 1946
I attach far more importanc to the cultural aspect of education
than to the literary2. Culture is the foundation, the primary thing
which the girls ought to get from here. It should show in the smallest
detail of your conduct and personal behaviour, how you sit, how you
walk, how you dress, etc., so that anybody might be able to see at a
glance that you are the products of this institution. Inner culture must
be reflected in your speech, the way in which you treat visitor and
guests, and behave towards one another and your teachers and elders.
I was pleased too that you walked all the distance to and from
Bhangi Nivas, when you came to see me.  But if you came only to
please me, your trudging had no merit. It will do you no good.  You
must make it a rule to prefer walking to using a  conveyance.  Motor-
car is not for the millions. You will therefore shun it.  Million cannot
afford even train journey. Their world is their village. It is a very small
thing but  if you faithfully adhere to this rule it will transform your
entire life and fill it with a sweetness that natural simplicity carries with
it.
Education here won’t qualify you for luxurious living. I          
want the Harijan girls here to show such a degree of culture               
that everybody should feel ashamed to regard them as untouch-        
ables.  That   is   the   goal  of  the  Harijan  Sevak  Sangh’s activities.
This institution should demonstrate to the whole world the heights to
which Harijans can rise, if they are free from the incubus of untouch-
ability and conversely the sacrilege and inhumanity of the institution
of untouchability itself. I look forward to the day when this institution
will fill the whole country with its fragrance and become a centre of
attraction for girls from near and far.

[April 20, 1946 ]2
I have proved my claim to being a member of the family by
coming without previous notice,
Gandhiji remarked, touched by the spontaneous welcome.  He then invited
questions.
One student asked, “What can the students do to bring about Hindu-Muslim
unity?”
The way is simple.  Even if all the Hindus turn rowdies and
abuse you, you may not cease to regard them as your blood-brothers
and vice versa .  Is it imposible?  No, rather the contrary. And what is
possible for the individual is possible for the mass.
Today the whole atmosphere is poisoned. All kinds of wild.
rumours are circulated by the press  and are indiscriminately swal-    
lowed by the people. Panic results and both Hindus and Muslmans   
forget their humanity and behave towards one another like wild   
brutes. It behoves men to act decently, irrespective of what the other
party might or might not do.  If one returns decency for decency, it is
a bargain. Even thieves and dacoits do that. There is no merit in it.
Humanity disdains to  calculate profits and losses. It enjoins on one a
unilateral obligation to put up decent behaviour. If all the Hindus
listened to my advice, or in the alternative the Muslims listened to     
me, there would be peace in India which neither daggers nor lathis         
would be able to shatter. The mischief-maker will soon be weary of
the sorry business of stabbing, when there is no retaliation or counter-
pro-vocation.  An Unseen Power will arrest his uplifted arm and it will
refuse to obey his wicked will. You may throw dust at the sun, it won’t
dim his lustre.  All it needs is to hold one’s soul in faith and patience.
God is good and does not allow wickness to proced beyond a certain
length.
I had a hand in the bulding up of this institution.1  It, therefore,

of returning  to his residence from the Balika Ashram, but a number of students and
some members of the staff from Jamia Millia came and requested him to pay a  visit
some time, to their institution too.  “Some time must mean now”, replied Gandhiji.
“Having come  so  far I cannot go back without going to  you.”

348.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER   MEETING
April 20, 1946
Addressing the gathering after th e prayers on Saturday evening Mahatma
Gandhi emphasized the fact that Ramanama recited from the heart was the never-failing remedy for all the ills—physical, mental of spiritual.  He watched them takingpart in th e Ramdhun  but whether  they did it from the heart God alone knew.  They
themselves might know.  But self-deception was quite possible.  It was so very easy.One thing was clear.  If a man or a woman who claimed to recite Ramanama from theheart was always ailing or was given to outbursts of anger the claim was eventuallyunproved.
Tolstoy had said that if man dismissed God from his heart even for a single
moment Satan occupied the vacancy.  Ramanama would expel Satan.  Honest men andwomen had said to him that with all their efforts they could not say tha Ramanamacame to them from the heart.  His reply to them was that they must go on and haveinfinite patience.  A boy required at least 16 years’ hard study in order to become adoctor.  How mcuh more time must be necessary to establish Ramanama in the heart?
While he was endeavouring to enthrone God in the hear t and believed in
nature’s way he would confine to the five elements as curative means.  He would givefirst place to pure air.  It was the prime necessity.  That implied  that their houses andsocial surroundings should be perfectly clean.  They must not live in air-tight boxesmiscalled houses.  They should live as free practically as they were on the prayerground.

Shri J. C. Kumarappa, writing in th e Gram Udyog Patrika , says
that to rely on or encourage imports from abroad is wholly wrong inprinciple.  In the matter of the expected shortage of sugar owing tothe failure of winter rains in the U. P. and Bihar and by frost in thePunjab and N. W. F. P., he suggests  that the deficit in sugar should bemade good b y tapping  palm trees in jungle areas for nira

In regard to the import of a primary necessity like kerasne oil,
he suggests further extraction of vegetable oils to meet our needs.
Imports will entail export of some of our own production to pay for
them, and will only cause further distress in the long run.
He also draws attention to the insidious scheme for the
development of Virginia cigarette tobacco in Bihar sponsored by Sir
Herbert Stewart (Vice-Chairman of the Imperial Council of Agricul-
tural Research). Under the scheme a nember of research stations on
tobacco are to be opened in various places  and the places and the
Imperial Tobacco Company have given two studentships of £500 per
annum for  training in tobacco cultivation abroad.  At such a time the
obvious duty of a government should have been not to waste good
money or time on tobacco research, but to devote both to reclaim all
available land for food cultivation.  But Imperial Councial can only
think in terms of either tobacco, long staple cotton or thick rind
sugar-cane for mills and ground-nut for export, and thus serve
foreign business masquerading as “India, Ltd.”.

Harijan is variously described as ‘ Harijan Sevak’  when it is the
Hindustani and Harijanbandhu  when it is  the Gujarati edition.
Hindustani was Hindi when it was Nagari type only.  Now, for reasons
already known, it is Hindustani in the two scripts—Nagari and Urdu.
The Urdu edition would have been published simultaneously, if the
arrangement could have been completed.  But there were difficulties
of official permission and type  to be surmounted. Litho printing
became well-nigh impossible, and expert advice favoured Urdu type.
The type could not be had for the wanting.  But it is now hoped
definitely to bring out the Urdu edition on 5th May next.
Whilst the matter in the three editions is not as a rule mere
translation, one of another, and to an extent differs in the three
editions, the Nagari and Urdu will be the same, word for word. An
endeavour will be made to produce Hindustani which will neither be
Sanskritized Hindi nor Persianized Urdu.  Whether the Hindustani will
be popular or not will depend as much upon the writers for the
Hindustani Harijan as upon its readers.

351.  IS  IT  GENUINE?
Q.In one of your post-prayer discourese last week you stressed the use of
khadi to the exclusion of all other cloth.1  I love the very touch of khadi as it links
me, in my heart and thoughts, to my poor sisters and brothers, to whom it brings a
well-earned morsel of food.  I love it  from every point of view—on hygienic,
aesthetic, humanitarian, moral and spiritual grounds.  But I have so far never been
able to take to spinning, much as I like the soothing hum of the wheel, and thanks  to
our system of education, my hands are utterly untrained and unfit to learn spinning at
this stage.  I am, therefore, unable to comply in a straightforward manner with the
condition now imposed on the sale  of khadi, and it is galling to me to have to go in
for mill cloth .
A.If the love for khadi is so genuine as to cover moral and
spiritual  values, surely the writer should be able to learn spinning
easily at his age.  The late Pandit Motilal Nehru learnt it, after he was
1Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 16-4-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 291fifty.  The late Ali Brothers learnt it,  though they did not practise it
regularly.  And all these three learnt it for its national and political
value in the highest sense of the term.  As a matter of fact most of the
public workers learnet it late in life.
The writer should learn spinning without delay. There is nothing
wrong with his fingers.  All who can write can spin. And spinning for
swaraj is any day more valuable than writing.  
I agree that for one like the writer the only straight forward way
to give his quota of yarn for buying khadi is self-spinning.  If he was
incapable for any cause, it would be perfectly right for him to get his
many friends or relations to spin the required quota for him.
As an earnest student of affairs, he shold know, too, that while
khadi is good for the poor as an honourable occupation for earning
bread, it  has an additional and far greater value as an instrument of
winning swaraj through non-violent means.  Let  it not be said of men
like him that they could write eloquently about moral values without
realizing the implications of the statement.

352.  MERCY v.  RUTHLESSNESS1
The virtues of mercy, non-violence, love and truth in any man
can be truly tested only when they are pitted against ruthlessness,
violence, hate and untruth.
If this is true, then it is incorrect to say that ahimsa is of            
no avail before a murderer. It can certainly be said that to expe-      
riment with ahimsa in the face of a murderer  is to seek self-destruc-   
tion. But this is the real test of ahimsa. He who gets himself killed out
of sheer helplessness, however,  can in nowise be said to  have passed
the test.  He who when being killed bears no anger against his
murderer and even ask God to forgive him is trulymnon-violent.
History relates this of Jesus Christ. With his dying breath on the cross,
he is reported to have said: “Father, forgive them for they know not
what they do.” We can get similar instances from other religions but
the quotation is given because it is world-famous.
It is another matter that our non-violence has not reached such
heights. It would be wholly wrong for us to lower the standard of
1 The Gujarati original appeared in Harijanbandhu , 28-4-1946.292 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIahimsa by reason of our own frailty or lack of experience. Without
true understanding of the ideal, we can never hope to reach it. It is
necessary for us, therefore, to apply our reason to understand the
power of non-violence.

April 21, 1946
Gandhiji had noticed that several men and women did not take part in    
beating time with Ramdhun .  He pulled them up in his after-prayer discourses on
Sunday.   There was nothing to be ashamed  of in repeating the name of God and in
beating time with it.  Modesty was an admirable virtue, but out of place it became       
a fault.
Reverting to the subject of the previous evening, i. e., nature cure, Gandhiji
spoke about pure water, the second in importance among the five natural elements,
the first one being air about which he had spoken on Saturday3 .  Large numbers of
men and women in this country drank impure water and washed their clothes with and
bathed in water which made the body and the clothes dirtier than before.

gutter water?  Yet many of the small  tanks where people bathe and   
wash and even drink from are no cleaner  than the gutter.  Nature is
lenient.  If often does not punish us for our sins immediately.  Thus
we  can go  on breathing impure air and drinking impure water over
long periods without any dramatic ill effects.  But there is not the
slightest doubt that such a thing lowers the vitality and makes one fall
an easy prey to  disease.
Gandhiji  told the audience what he had seen on the banks of the sacred Ganges
at Hardwar.  People went there  to wast off their sins, but they made the place so dirty
that it  could not  even wash their bodies clean.  He used to find it difficult to bathe at
Har-ki-Pauri if he was at all late.  People evacuated on the banks and did not even care
to cover it up with sand.  They made the bathing-ghat filthy, strewing flowers  were
trampled under the feet and so on.  It was a painful state of affairs, a thing of which
Indains had real cause to be ashamed.
He had taken up the new job of advising people on nature cure.  A               
doctor had to go through five years of  hard studies before he could begin to            
treat patients.  Not so the nature-cure man. Speaking about himself he said                 
he had picked up the essentials of nature cure by reading a few books and            
talking to  experts in the line.  Experience and experimentation had made up             
the rest. They could all do the same and became their own doctors.  People                
had a notion that what was simple was no good.  A spinning-wheel was               
simple.  It was, therefore, condemned as primitive and crude.   A mill cost a lot and
was elaborate.  It was an indication of progress.  If this was their view,  he was afraid
they would have no use  for him as  he was but a simple-minded villager and a 
believer in the philosophy of simplicity.  But  he knew that most of them were
simple-minded men and women like him and though they lived in a city, they had not
lost all contact with the villages.  Therefore, he felt emboldened to place nature cure
before them.
Pure air and pure water were the first essentials, and of course Ramanama was
there all the time.  A man who repeated Ramanama and thereby cleansed his inner
being could not tolerate the filth outside.  If millions took to Ramanama in real
earnest  there would be no riots, which were a social malady, and there would  be no
illnesses.  The  Kingdom of Heaven would come on earth.

It is legitimate to ask what Congress ministers will  do for
khaddar and other village industries now that they are in office. I
should broaden the question and apply it to all the Provincial
Government of India.  Poverty is common to all the  provinces and so
are means of alleviation in terms of the masses. Such is the experience
of both the A. I. S. A. and the A. I. V. I. A.  A suggestion has been
made that there should be a separate minister for the work, as, for
proper organization, it will occupy all the time of one minister.I dread
to make the  suggestion, for we have not yet outlived the English scale
of expenditure. Whether a minister is separately  appointed or not, a
department for the work is surely necessary. In these times of scarcity
of food and clothing, this department can render the  greatest help.
The  ministers have experts at their disposal through the A. I. S. A.
and the A. I. V. I. A.  It is possible to clothe today the whole of India
in khadi on the smallest outlay and in the shortest time possible. Each
Provincial Government has to tell the villagers that they must manu-
facture their own khaddar for their own use. This there will undoub-
tedly be a surplus for the cities at least to a certain extent which, in its
turn, will reduce the pressure on the local mills.  The latter will then be
able to take part in  supplying the want of cloth in  other  parts of the
world. How can this result be  brought about?
The Governments should notify the villagers that they will be
expected to manufacture khaddar for the needs of their villages within
a fixed date after which no cloth will be supplied to them.The Govern-
ments in their turn will supply the villagers with cotton seed or cotton
wherever required, at cost price and the tools of manufacture  also at
cost, to be recovered in easy instalments payable in, say five years or
more. They will supply them with instructors wherever necessary and
undertake to buy surplus stock of khaddar, provided that the villagers
in question have their cloth requirement supplied from their own
manufacture. This should do away with cloth shortage without fuss
and with very little overhead charges.
The villages  will be surveyed and a list prepared of things that
can be manufactured locally with little or no help and which may be
required for village use or for sale outside, such for instance, as ghani1
pressed oil  and cakes, burning oil prepared through ghanis, hand-
1 Oil-pressVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 295pounded rice, tad gud1, honey, toys, mats, hand-made paper, village
soap, etc.  If enough care is thus taken, the villages, most of them as
good as dead or dying, will hum with life and exhibit the immense
possibilities they have of supplying most of their wants themselves and
of the cities and towns of India.  
Then there is the limitless cattle wealth of India suffering from
criminal neglect.  Goseva Sangh, as yet not properly experienced, can
still supply valuable aid.
Without the basic training the villagers are being starved for
education. This desideretum can be supplied by the Hindustani Tamil
Sangh. The experiment was already commenced by Congress Govern-
ments but it was interrupted by the resignations of the Congress
ministries.2  The thread can be  easily resumed now.

SUGAR  AND  SWEETMEATS
Q.The suggar ration in Bombay has just been reduced by 25 per cent.  Would
it not have  been fairer to reduce sweetmeat shops’ rations rather than cut down the
individual’s?
A.It is always well to cut down the ration of sweet vendors
rather than that of individuals.  In these hard times I would not mind
if sweet-making were even prohibited.  Sweetmeats are not a necessary
part of a wholesome diet.
WHITE  BREAD  AND  BROWN
Q.Up till January it was obligatory to mix ten per cent of bran with wheat
flour.  Later the rule was obolished.  Should it not be reinforced?
A.I am a witness to the age-old rivalry between white and
whole-meal brown bread.  People are attracted by whiteness. I nurse
the belief  that Negro is not drawn by it.  Be that as it may, it is a fact
that special effort is  made to make bread look white. Fortunately,
only  city-dwellers indulge in such fads.  Doctors say that one chapati
of whole-meal flour is more tasty and contains more nourishment than
two to  five chapatis made out of refined  flour.  And in these days  it

From one point of view it is even more than that. Wheat stored in
villages is  far more useful than sacks of it lying in ports. Therefore, it
is desirable to make the mixing of bran with  wheat flour compu-
lsory.  The war is  over but post-war conditions are worse for us than
during the  war, and the situation is daily deteriorating.  God alone
knows when it will improve.
ROWDYISM  IN  ELECTIONS
Q.You are no doubt aware of the  rowdyism  resulting in severe damage
during one of the recent elections in Bombay.  Does it become the teacher of ahimsa
to keep silent on such an occasion?
A.I do not want to enter into the question of whether silence
becomes me or not.  If the rowdyism is not a forerunner of what the
future holds, it will be  wrong to take note of it.  Such sporadic clashes
should not worry us. The education  of the masses in ahimsa can
make way gradually. It may be that it will develop from the lessons
learnt from such happenings. But it may be that this rowdyism is
symptomatic of an epidemic. Many people imagine that they alone
are right and  everyone else wrong, and they do not consider   that
there is anything unworthy in forcing their point of view down others’
throats.   This error has to be rectified.  If we are in the right we must
have infinite patience.
Just now we seem unable to see our own mistakes.  Those who
lack the faculty of reason, or who desire to live for the sake of enjoy-
ment, can never see the error.  If there are many such,  then we must
conclude that our non-violence has been a weapon of the weak, himsa
masquerading in the guise of ahimsa. If this  weakness  conti-nue we
shall have to go through rivers of blood once the British rule goes.
We may even  come under the sway of some other  foreign power or it
may be that with internecine warfare the weaker side will have to
submit to the one that has the mightier weapons. If we are unfortunate
enough to witness such streif, believers in  non-violence  will joyfully
die in the effort to stop it and thereby live.
My hope is that the masses have sufficiently imbibed the spirit
of ahimsa and that when the British go there may be a little fight here
and there and then we shall settle down  as brothers giving a lesson of
peace to the  world.
Only those who fought in Bombay know what good they
achieved by fighting.  I  am ignorant of who fought and what the
fight was about and what were the gains if any.

Learn it from me if you don’t have it.  In doing this there will be no

362.  TALK  WITH  A  ZAMINDAR2
[Before  April 23,  1946 ]3
“Where shall we stand when India is independent?” asked a friend representing
the landholders’ interests, the other day during his visit to Gandhiji.”
You wil be as free as any scavenger, but whether you will be able
to retain all the privileges which you are enjoying under the British
Government is a question you can answer for yourself.
1 Jayakrishna  P. Bhansali
2 This and the following item are reproduced from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter”
dated “New Delhi, April 23, 1946”.
3 ibidVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 299We realize that we shall secure our salvation at the hands of  Indian leaders, not
the British Government.
Everybody believes that today. Even the British Government   
feel that they cannot do otherwise than to leave India to settle her own
affairs.
The landholders derived their charter of rights and privileges from the
Permanent Settlement which was of the nature of a contract between the British and
the zamindars, but they are quite willing to negotiate an agreement with the leaders of
the country on the future of their rights.
Being a non-violent man by nature I cannot countenance the
usurpation of anybody’s just rights.  But some of the extraordinary
privileg that pass muster under the British rule are themselves in the
nature of an usurpation.  The history of British rule is a history of
usurpation.  Those who helped the British Government in this process
got certain rights as a reward for their services.  These cannot be
insisted upon.
Many ancient zamindaris1 existed long before the advent of the British and
were exercising sovereign power, as a produce of indigenous social and economic
system of long standing.  Don’t you think they have a title to continue their
existence?  They are trying their best to discharge a philanthropic function in the
shape of founding educational and social institutions.
Anything that is ancient and consistent with moral values has a
title to be retained. Per contra anything that does not conform to
more values has to go. Wrong has no prescriptive right to exist merely
because it is of long standing. If those who are on your zamindaris
feel one with  you and  you with them, like members of a family, you
have nothing to fear from anybody.
We want even-handed justice.  We have no objection to an indepedent Indian
Government abolishing all manner of vested  interests. But let there be no discrimin-
ation against the zamindars especially. We only want a conciliatory gest-ure, an
assurance that you won’t wipe us out as a class, without giving us a sporting chance
to vindicate our existence.
A just man need have no fear of any kind from an independent.
India may, however, fall into unjust hands.  Every  Congressman is not
an angel, nor is everyone who  is not a Congressman a devil. Let us
hope that, if Congress comes into power, it will try to be more than
just.  Otherwise all the good that  it might have done would disappear
in the twinkling of an eye.
I do not deny that there are bad boys amongst us.  But you can cure us.  We
1 Absentee  landlordism300 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIonly wish that nothing should be done without consulting us.
That goes without saying.1
Harijan, 28-4-1946
363.  TALK WITH  MISSIONARIES
[Before  April 23, 1946 ]
Another group of friends presented Gandhiji with a poser: “Could he
guaranteed that under independence the right of proselytization would be guaranteed
by a statue?”  This provoked the counter question, “Did they really believe in the ideal
of independence or was their support  to the independence ideal only  for a
consideration?”  In the latter case, he  would say, remarked Gandhiji, that they
believed neither in independence nor in religion.   Who could suppress the  voice of
truth if it filled one’s being?  And of what avail was a statutory gurantee if there was
not the fire within to bear witness to truth?
“It is true, no one can suppress the  voice of truth,” interpolated one of them.
“We want a guarantee from you that no attempt would be made to suppress it.”
I cannot give you that guarantee because I have no authority.
It was the function of religion, he continued, to save the temporal power from
losing its soul; religion did not depend upon it for protection.  And he cited to them
the illustraction of Daniel, the servant of God, who used to pray behind closed doors.
But when Darius the King issued a decree prohibiting the worship of any God or man
save himself under a penalty, he began to pray to God publicly, the windows of his
chamber being open so that all could see him praying.  He was thrown into the
hungry lion’s den but came out unscathed.  The result was that the King  rescinded his
former decree which was ‘unalterable’ under the laws of Medes and Persians and made
another decree to the effect that in every dominion of his kingdom, “men tremble and
fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God and steadfast as ever.”  And “so
Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and  in the reign of Cyrus.”  That was the only
true way of proselytization and it needed no guarantee, statutory or otherwise.  It was
its own seal and sanction.
To take a leaf from the history  of our own times, remember  the  
words of the late Lord Salisbury who, when in office, had told a
missionary deputation about [sic] China that they were a poor
specimen if for their mission they sought the protection of British
guns.

368.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING
April 23, 1946
Speaking after the prayers, Gandhiji thanked the Maulvi Saheb for the
recitation.2   The selections3 were not all made by him.  For instance, the  Koranic
prayer had been introduced by Raihanabehn Tyabji4.  She came    and recited it herself
in the beginning and then taught it to others.  The prayer from Zend Avesta  was
introduced by Dr. Gilder5.  May be there were  mistakes in the recitation.  But God
cared for what was in men’s hearts rather than what was produced from their mouths.
It would be best if a Muslim recited the Koranic prayer and a Parsi recited the Parsi
prayer and so on.  But in the absence of such an arrangement one did the best one
could.

Gandhi had made it his profession to teach people Ramdhun  and through it discipline
in every walk of life.  They should all sit in regular rows instead of in a disorderly and
haphazard fashion.
He had come to know that Harijan collections at the prayer meetings were very
meagre nowadays.  That was bad.  They should all contribute their bit according to
their capacity.
Finally, he reverted to the question of nature cure.  He had talked to them about
air and water.1  Today he wanted to talk about earth, the earth which the human body is
made of and to which it must return.
Whether the dead are buried or cremated, dust returns to dust.
Like air and water, earth is God’s creation and we must not soil it.
People were in the habit of spitting anywhere, throwing orange skins and bits
of paper here and there.  All that was sin.  To put anything out of place was equivalent
to soiling the earth.  A man of prayer could never do that.
Death might claim us at any moment.  Let us then be on the
alert and recite Ramanama all the time.  We must cleanse if we can,
never soil, His creation.

BHAI  BHAGWADACHARYA ,
I have your letter after many days. I must admit that I don’t like
it.  Firstly, why should you involve yourself in the ritual sacrifice
which is more or less a fraud? I can understand those who are
ignorant of the true nature of dharma or are downright hypocrites
busying themselves with it, but why a man like you should concern
himself with it is something beyond my comprehension, especially
because I don’t want to look upon you as a hypocrite and because I
am not prepared to believe that you are so sunk in abysmal ignorance.
And if there was a sacrifice, wherefore all the discrimination? Those
who do not want to come may not; those who want may come. Hence,
in no way can my heart accept either your act or your justification of
it.  I would wish you to devote yourself single-heartedly to what is
straightforward and truthful, rather than indulge in mere casuistry.
I am strongly opposed to sacrifice as it is currently interpret-        
ed. I consider it a sin to throw ghee into the sacrificial [fire] in our
age. Sacrifice really means an act of service.  I had thefefore hoped
that you would follow only that which is truthful even by giving up

379.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING5
April 24, 1946
Speaking after the prayers on Wednesday evening Gandhiji reverted to the
place of earth, which in nature cure was only next to air and water.  One of the curative
uses of earth was an earth-bath.  Dry, finely powdered earth rubbed on the body
cleansed the skin.  Mud applied to the body and allowed to dry could cure many skin
diseases.  More than 40 years ago a little nephew of his had boils all over the body.
They were slow to respond to any treatment.  Finally he took the case in his hands,
covered the boy’s body with mud and made him run about naked.  The boy was cured in
eight to ten days.
Gandhiji said that earth was full of miraculous properties and it was as useful in
man’s life as any other thing could be.
We are born of earth and return to earth after life’s journey.  In
the morning prayers there is a shloka in which the devotee invokes
1 Yamunadutt Brahmachari, Purnachandra Azad, Basantsingh Bhring and
Raghubir Singh Tyagi, four workers from Meerut, who had been released from prison
after three and a half years, met Gandhiji and asked him three questions.
2 The question was : “In the present age of party strife, what is the duty of the
workers who have been released recently?’
3 The second question was : “What is their duty in the panic-stricken areas
where there are strong rumours about riots ?”
4 The last question was : “What is the remedy in nature cure for dysentery, a
common disease among those who have been released from prison ?”

expect our prayer to be heard, we must show our reverence in
practice.  We must not soil the earth or dirty it as many of us do
today.  If somebody soils the earth through ignorance or oversight by
spitting or in any other manner, we should cover up the filth with dry
earth.

380.  THE MONKEY  NUISANCE1
People get weary of the trouble caused to them by monkeys.  In
their hearts they wish them dead.  They are inwardly pleased if
anyone kills them.  At the same time they will oppose their slaughter.
A friend who is well acquainted with the scriptures writes that
monkeys ruin the crops, they even kidnap children, carry away
articles, and eat up fruit, etc.  Their number is daily increasing.  I am
asked as to what non-violence dictates in the matter.
My ahimsa is my own.  I am not able to accept in its entirety the
doctrine of non-killing of animals.  I have no feeling in me to save the
lives of animals which devour or cause hurt to man.  I consider it
wrong to help in the increase of their progeny.  Therefore, I will not
feed ants, monkeys or dogs.  I will never sacrifice a man’s life in
order to save theirs.
Thinking along these lines I have come to the conclusion that to
do away with monkeys where they have become a menace to the well-
being of man is pardonable.  Such killing becomes a duty.  The
question may arise as to why this rule should not also apply to human
beings.  It cannot because, however bad, they are as we are. Unlike the
animal, man has been given the faculty of reason.

ON  SALT1
(A)  THE  PROCLAMATION
In order that the poorest in the land may feel that independence
is coming and as an earnest of their bona fides , the Government of
India declare that the Salt Tax is abolished from today.  To that end
the inspectors of . . .2 shall withdraw from their scenes of activity and
the villagers will be notified by beat of drum and otherwise that they
are at liberty to manufacture salt wherever they can for themselves or
for sale.  Other instructions about the State manufacture and sale of
salt will be issued in due course.
(B)  NOTE  ON  THE  PROPOSED  PROCLAMATION  ON  SALT
When the Salt Tax is abolished the monopoly goes likewise.
Individuals should be free to manufacture salt for consumption or
sale.  Therefore, while there would be no monopoly in law, the
Government will by their better organizing power and scientific skill
be able to create a virtual monopoly.  They will not allow private
corporations to make manufacture and sale of salt a source of
profiteering.  It will be a legitimate paying business in the hands of
the State.  Consumption of the article is so universal that the profit of
even a pie on every seer would bring in a natural income to the State.
Every dealer in salt will be required to take out a licence for selling
salt in his shop.  [A] dealer is not to be confused with a hawker.  A
hawker who carried salt on his person will be free to sell without a
licence.  This will free the individual manufacturer and seller from
interference.
Government will add to the revenue also by putting a heavy,
though not a prohibitive, customs duty on foreign salt, whether British
or otherwise.
Whilst anxiety has been shown in this note to show how salt may
be made to yield legitimate revenue to the State, equal if not greater
1 In response to Gandhiji’s suggestion about the abolition of the Salt Tax Sir
Archibald Rowlands, Finance Member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, had        
met Gandhiji on April 5, 1946.  The draft and the note were sent to Sir Archibald        
in compliance with his request.  The Transfer of Power, however, places the
proclamation just after Gandhiji’s letter to the Viceroy dated April 6, 1946. For

I am writing on Gandhiji’s behalf.
He was under the impression that all I. N. A. prisoners were going to be
released in batches.  Meanwhile he gets from Shri Raghunandan Saran a paper with
reference to three trials.1  A copy thereof is enclosed.
Before Gandhiji offers any further remarks he would like to know, if you do not
mind, why these impending trials and consequent irritation, seeing that independence
is imminent?2

384.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING
April 25, 1946
Speaking after the prayers, Gandhiji introduced Badshah Khan as a fakir and a
man of God.  He had come to Delhi in connection with the meeting of the Working
Committee of which he was a member.  But he was essentially a man of God.  His
company was satsang, hallowed company for them as it was for him.
Gandhiji told the audience of a letter he had received from a correspondent
criticizing Mr. Kanu Gandhi and the way he led Ramdhun .  Ramdhun  should be in the
heart; where was the need for all the external show, the correspondent had asked.
There was no doubt, observed Gandhiji, that Ramanama should come from the heart.
But the external things were an indication of what was within.  Supposing everyone
struck a different note while reciting prayers in the mosque or during the chanting of
hymns in the church, it would utterly ruin the solemnity of the service.  There was a
right way of doing everything and prayers were no exception.
A gentleman, Gandhiji proceeded, had sent him a book describing how namaz1
should be offered.  While turning over the pages of that book he came across a
sentence in it which was to the effect that prayer said in congregation was 27        
times as effective as prayer said by oneself.  If they all joined in the prayer       
whole-heartedly and methodically it would gather momentum in geometric
progression and so transform the atmosphere that riots in Delhi would become an
impossibility.

1 Prayer as offered by Muslims314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI385.  STATEMENT  TO  THE  PRESS
NEW  DELHI,
April 26, 1946
Mr. Hoover’s1 flying visit to India has excited considerable   
interest and possibly hope.  Whilst all the help that America and     
other countries can send to India, struggling against starvation,         
must be welcome, my endeavour has been to find ways and means        
to make ourselves self-supporting.  the moment people give way to
panic, starvation is a certainty in spite of a continuous line of steamers
off-loading grain from outside on India’s wharves.  Conversely, every
grain from abroad sent as a matter of duty to self-reliant India,   
honestly and manfully braving the threatening danger, will be twice
blessed.  Let Mr. Hoover’s visit serve as a reminder to Government
servants, monied men and grain merchants that they must think all     
the time of their duty to the masses.  Nature never fails those who will
help themselves.

386.  NON-VIOLENT  VOLUNTEER  CORPS2
Some time ago an attempt was made, at my instance, to form
shanti dals3 but nothing came of it.  This lesson, however, was learnt,
that the membership, in its very nature, of such organizations could
not be large.  Ordinarily, the efficient running of a large volunteer
corps based on force implies the possibility of the use of force in the
event of breach of discipline.  In such bodies little or no stress is laid
on a man’s character.  Physique is the chief factor.  The contrary
must obtain in non-violent bodies in which character or soul force
must mean everything and physique must take second place.  It is
difficult to find many such persons.  That is why non-violent corps
must be small, if they are to be efficient.  Such brigades may be
scattered all over; there may be one each for a village or a mohalla4.
The members must know one another well.  Each corps will select its
own head.  All the members will have the same status, but where

3 Peace Corps
4 LocalityVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 315everyone is doing the same work there must be one person under
whose discipline all must come, or else the work will suffer.  Where
there are two or more brigades the leaders must consult among
themselves and decide on a common line of action.  In that way alone
lies success.
If non-violent volunteer corps are formed on the above lines,     
they can easily stop trouble. These corps will not require all the  
physical training given in akhadas1 but a certain part of it will be
necessary.
One thing, however, should be common to members of all such
organizations and that is implicit faith in God.  He is the only
Companion and Doer.  Without faith in Him these peace brigades will
be lifeless.  By whatever name one calls God, one must realize that one
can only work through His strength.  Such a man will never take
another’s life.  He will allow himself, if need be, to be killed and
thereby live through his victory over death.
The mind of the man in whose life the realization of this law has
become a living reality will not be bewildered in a crisis.  He will
instinctively know the right way to act.
In spite, however, of what I have said above I would like to give
some rules culled from my own experience :
1.A volunteer may not carry any weapons.
2.The members of a corps must be easily recognizable.
3.Every volunteer must carry bandages, scissors, needle and
thread, surgical knife, etc., for rendering first-aid.
4.He should know how to carry and remove the wounded.
5.He should know how to put out fires, how to enter a fire area
without getting burnt, how to climb heights for rescue work and
descend safely with or without his charge.
6.He should be well-acquainted with all the residents of his
locality.  This is a service in itself.
7.He should recite Ramanama ceaselessly in his heart and
persuade others who believe in it to do likewise.
There are many who, whether from mental laziness or from
having fallen into a bad habit believe that God is and will help us
unasked.  Why then is it necessary to recite His name? It is true that if
1 Gymnasiums316 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIGod is, He is, irrespective of our belief.  But realization of God is
infinitely more than mere belief.  That can come only by constant
practice.  This is true of all science.  How much more true of the
science of all sciences !
Man often repeats the name of God parrot-wise and expects
fruit from so doing.  The true seeker must have that living faith which
will not only dispel the untruth of parrot-wise repetition from within
him but also from the hearts of others.

387.  WHITED  SEPULCHRES?1
I am a woman but feel I must write to you about this matter.  About three
months ago a man who said he was . . .’s servant came here. . . .  One evening he
brought a car and asked me if I had ever been in one and if not, would I not go with
him for an outing?  It never entered my head to suspect him and I acceded to his
request.  I was first taken to . . . where I was gagged and later we proceeded to a house
in. . . . For some days every effort was made to commit an outrage on me. . . .  Then
one day a wealthy merchant and Congress leader of . . . came and asked me to go and
enjoy life with him in . . . .
Later one day I was rescued by a friend of my father’s with the help of the
police.
I have received more than one such letter2 accusing some
Congressmen of immorality.  It would not be wisdom to believe that
they are all untrue and ignore the complaint.  It has never been
claimed that every Congressman is a model of virtue. But it is a matter
of pride that the public expect a high standard of morality from
Congressmen.  All kinds of immorality are prevalent among us.  It is a
reformer’s duty to try to wean from error those who are justly
accused of misbehaviour. There are limits to immorality, if any can be
claimed to pass muster.  If what has been related is true, every man has
to ask himself how far he is justified in seeking to satisfy his lust at the
expense of innocent girls.

An A. I. S. A. worker writes thus :2
You have said that we must make the spinners self-sufficient and that to
obtain swaraj through their activity is the aim of the A. I. S. A. . . . This       
way lies swaraj, you say.  I admit it is right for spinners to learn well all the
processes. . . . The quality of yarn and cloth will also improve.  But how can
we win our freedom this way?  How are we to bring home this lesson to the
spinners?
Imagine, if all the spinners understood the inner meaning of the
wheel and span willingly and not under pressure, what an India there
would be!  The awakening of crores of women spinners would ipso
facto produce lakhs of khadi-weavers.  Imagine too the numbers of
men and women workers needed to bring about this awakening!  If
such a time comes, textile mills, even if any were working, would have
to rely on foreign countries for the sale of their produce.  They would
not, as they do today, hold imperialistic sway over the villages and
cities.  There would be Hindu-Muslim unity, all would be truthful,
there would be no need to tell anyone to wear khadi, for no cloth
other than home-spun would be available.  That swaraj is hidden in
this revolutionary change should be self-evident to seeing eyes.  The
question may imply that such a consummation is impossible.  If such
is the question, it means that swaraj through non-violent means is
impossible.3
Another question asked is how the spinners are to be given the
requisite education.  To seek out the right answer is the main work of
the A. I. S. A.  Enough research has not so far been done.  It is the
duty of every A. I. S. A. worker to try to solve the puzzle.  Now that
we have Congress ministries in several provinces the work should be
easy. Let the workers throw themselves heart and soul into it. They
will never succeed if they look all the time to the Central Office for
help and guidance.

I have gone through your long letter.  there is nothing private in

I was not pained by your letter.  I see, however, that my vanity is
disappearing.  I thought I understood a large number of people.  But
I can now see my ignorance more clearly.  I welcome this.
I do not know when I shall be able to see your activities with my
own eyes.1  But I do wish to see them some time.
It seems to me that you remain excited and tense.  If so, that
must cease.
I had written a letter2 to you, but Sushila had held it back.  Now
that also will go with this.
I have put no pressure on you or anybody else, nor wish to.  If I
have made any mistake in regard to your work, I am ready to rectify
it.  Keep your promises3.  I will discuss this subject with Bapa.

April 26, 1946
Nobody knew who the miscreant5 was, said Gandhiji, nor would it be right to
venture a guess.
It might be presumed at first flush, that because the victim in this
case was a Hindu boy the assailant must be a Muslim and vice versa.

Pimple, a village in Maharashtra.

however, were not fatal.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 319Such speculation, in my opinion, is not only idle but mischievous.  We
should rather ask ourselves as to how we would have or should have
acted, if we were present on the scene.
To remain passive witnesses to the dastardly attack would cowardly.  Should
they, then, whip out a knife and pay back the miscreant in his own coin?  Both these
courses would be wrong, observed Gandhiji.  The only becoming course, he told
them, would be to plead with the miscreant not to stain his hands with innocent
blood.  If in doing so they themselves become victims of the miscreant’s anger, they
should not mind but should rather welcome it.  Such an occasion should provide them
with an opportunity to test the sincerity of their daily attendance at the prayer
meetings.
When passions rise high and panic and mass hysteria lay hold
on the people, it is up to the man of prayer to keep his head above the
storm and refuse to sink to the level of the brute.  We should pray to
God to help us to keep down the hatred and anger in the heart.  To be
able to conquer anger and hatred and all other baser passions is the
fruit of prayer.  It is braver far to disarm the miscreant with cool
determination devoid of anger than to counter him with a dagger, to
prevent an angry word from escaping one’s lips than to indulge in
abuse.
He recalled another instance of assault on a harmless German during the
Victory Day disturbances in Delhi that had been brought to his notice the day before.
The madness at the time was directed against Englishmen and Europeans.  In his
opinion, it was not less cowardly.
We should pity the ruffian. A Maulana who saw me just       
before I started for the prayer was telling me how a number of   
newspapers were fanning the flames of communal hatred day after
day and week after week.  They are the real culprits.  To incite murder
is as bad if not worse than the murder itself.  The actual murderer is
very often an ignorant tool, victim of mischievous propaganda.
But even such propaganda could take effect only in a vitiated atmosphere.  In a
healthy atmosphere it would be sterilized.
Panic is the result of fear after all.  But a man of prayer knows
no fear.  Your prayer is vain repetition if it does not clear the
atmosphere of fear, panic and mass hysteria.

You have raised three issues in your letter.
1.After completing their training in the camp the women are
bound to give their services to the Kasturba Trust.
2.The Trust is bound to give them work and pay them.
3.In every district one mature and experienced woman and
one comparatively younger woman should be posted.
Though these points are not included in the rules of the Trust, as
I had promised you before the rules were framed, all the three
demands have been accepted.
At the same time it is also recommended that :
1.Efforts should be made to collect as much money as
possible from the place concerned and the district.
2.Where work can be done through one mature and
experienced woman, only one should be posted, for, posting two
women of the same age and experience at the same place is likely to
result in conflict between them. There should be no objection,
however, to posting two women if one of them is elderly and the other
young.  This should be treated as an exception.  Care should be taken
to see that the exception does not become the rule.

392.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING1
April 27, 1946
Speaking after the prayers . . . Gandhiji dwelt on the danger of giving credence
to panicky reports.  Newspapers had reported that Bombay was full of panic, Hindus
dared not go into Muslim quarters and vice versa, the shops were closed early in the
evenings, the streets deserted and the people did not venture out at night for fear of
riots breaking out.  All that had proved to be a Press canard.  Gandhiji said that these
1 The report in The Hindustan Times had been collated with Pyarelal’s “Weekly
Letter” in Harijan.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 321false reports had reached him only today.  There was neither any panic nor disturbance
worth nothing in Bombay.  Hindu women and children freely visited and went about
in Muslim quarters and vice versa .  The whole story was faked.   In Delhi itself a Hindu
woman was being driven by a Muslim tonga-driver only the day before.  The driver
had expressed amazement and horror at what taking place.  “Why should there be any
quarrel between Hindus and Muslims?”  he had asked, and added, “God turns his back
on those who quarrel amongst themselves.”  That showed, remarked Gandhiji, how
dangerous it was to give credence to panicky rumours.
The lesson to be learnt from all this is, that we should not be
afraid, because people will always frighten the timid, not the brave.
But it was no use making a show of bravery when there was fear in the        
heart.  Probably they had all heard about a child playing with a snake without  
coming to harm.  But if a grown-up person who was afraid of snakes tried to play   
with one, it would detect fear in the very touch and probably bite him.  But suppos-  
ing they were afraid and wanted to shed fear, the first condition was that they must    
not carry any arms.  They should put faith in God and depend upon Him to protect
them.  The man who was afraid and carried arms repudiated God and made the arms       
his God.
Later, Gandhiji reverted to the theme of nature cure and talked about ether.
Man was made of clay but even clay was prevaded by ether.  The cavities in the human
body, the pores in the human skin were all filled by ether.  The stars, the sun and the
moon were suspended in the void.  The astronomers said there were many a heavenly
body, like the sun and the stars which the human eye could not see.  Gandhiji wanted
them to stretch their mental vision so as to grasp the infinity of ethereal space.  Ether
was the most intangible thing known to man, but it was occupied by something still
more intangible, namely, God.
In nature cure they had to establish contact with ether as with the earth.  They
could sleep under the sky and have as much empty space around them as possible.  If
they attuned themselves to ether they would realize what insignificant little creatures
they were and how ill-becoming it was for them to quarrel amongst themselves.
Gandhiji referred to his visit to the Bhangi quarters on Saturday morning.  He
lived on the outskirts of the Bhangi quarters.  But his was a clean and airy place,
where he could live all his life.  The Bhangi quarters were dirty and filthy.  Their
rooms were dark and ill-ventilated.  There was just one little vantilator in the room,
so that he felt suffocated as he entered it.  It was a shame that their brethren should
live in that state.  Gandhiji told the gathering to visit the Bhangi quarters.  The
Harijans had a right to feel that his claim to be one of them was more than mere idle
talk.
We are all made of earth, ether and the rest of the five elements.322 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIGod makes no distinction between man and man.  By ourselves we are
insignificant worms.  We become great when we reflect His greatness.
If we are attuned to Him, illness will not touch us.  And if perchance
we do fall ill, we shall be content to seek cure only through His grace
by the application of the simplest means provided by nature and not
run about hither and thither to find ways and means to prolong our
lives.

CRIMINALS  AND  NON-VIOLENCE
Q.What whould be the treatment meted out to criminals in free India in the
light of your non-violence?
A.In independent India of the non-violent type, there will be
crime but no criminals.  They will not be punished.  Crime is a disease
like any other malady and is a product of the prevalent social system.
Therefore, all crime including murder will be treated as a disease.
Whether such an India will ever come into being is another question.

NEW  DELHI,
April 28, 1946
Gandhiji said that it would have been better if the report had been sent to the
Congress leaders.
The volunteers had been in attendance in his camp.  Mahtma Gandhi thanked
them for the service they had rendered him and his party.  He knew the volunteers had
worked hard and had been doing night-and-day duty.  He felt grateful for the love and
diligence with which they had served him and his  party.  But what was the use of their
serving him if they served not the lowest among the low who were his next-door
neighbours.  They kept his place spotlessly clean but the sweepers’ quarters next door
were extremely dirty.  It was their shame as it was his.  He would not be satisfied till
they served the sweepers as they had served him.  They should rather go and serve the
Bhangis who lived next door to him in filth and squalor.  Such service carried with it
its own reward.  He had come to live in the filth in which they lived.  The fault was not
theirs but of those who had reduced them to that state.  The quarters provided for them
were worse than the worst prison cell that he had seen in India or in South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi recalled how he had written to Mr. Birla2, Mr. Viyogi Hari
and Mr. Brijkrishna Chandiwala to make arrangements for his stay in sweepers’
quarters.  They had done it.  He was Mr. Birla’s guest even here, as the management
and the expenses were Mr. Birla’s.  The result was that he was neither in Birla House
nor in the Bhangi quarters.
Gandhiji said he had identified himself with the Bhangis mentally, but he
could not live like them.  The Bhangis had a right to feel that his claim was an idle
one.  He would like them to go and work in the Bhangi quarters so that the place
became as clean as where he was staying.
If they went to the Bhangi quarters, not as their patrons or teachers but             
as their true servants, they would be able to reach their hearts and trans-                     
form the look of things in no time.  The volunteers were not do this by               
ordering the Bhangis.  They were to be their humble and silent servants.                 
Today those who became volunteers had a lurking desire to be counted as leaders.
This, he added, was bad.  Their one ambition should be to serve those whom we have
made the lowest of the low.

NEW  DELHI,
April 28, 1946
Gandhiji reminded the gathering that that was the last Sunday of the month.  It
was customary to have flag salutation on that day and render more service than usual.
Those who believed in spinning span more than usual on that day.  He had been to see
the volunteers in the morning.  From the report that was read out he had gathered that
they were doing a lot of good work.  Volunteers who would really and truly be
servants of the people were required in their millions.
There was hardly any merit in their serving him.  To serve the so-called big
people in order to gain importance or in order to earn their blessings should not be
their ideal.  Real selfless service carried with it its own reward.  They should go and
serve the Bhangis who lived next door to him in filth and squalor.
If sincere selfless workers came forth in their thousands, swaraj would be
theirs for the having.  The Cabinet Mission would find itself without any job.
Britons would quit India or decide to stay on as her servants.  Two hundred spinning-
wheels were plied on the prayer grounds for one and a quarter hours.  But Gandhiji said
that this demonstration did not come up to his requirements.  If swaraj was to come
through the spinning-wheel, everyone of them, young and old, had to spin regularly.
To those who easily lost their temper his prescription was to spin in silence.
The late Sir Prabhashanker Pattani1 used to suffer from insomnia.  Gandhiji
advised him to spin before going to bed, avoiding all talk of politics.  He did it for a
year round and wrote to him saying the prescription worked wonderfully well.

Soil corrosion eats up good soil.  It is bad enough. Caste
corrosion is worse, it eats up men and divides men from men.  Letters
continue to come from Christians, Parsis, naturally, from Scheduled
Castes and women.They require representation in the ministry.
Provincial competition is already there. The makers of ministries are
not free from the taint and even when they do not favour it, they will
lose caste if they dare to do the right thing and restrict their choice to
merit only. Democracy can only represent the average, if not less than
the average. Therefore, a democratic institution to be pure has to
attend to the all-round education of the humblest and the lowliest.  It
1 Dewan of Bhavnagar State326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImust take in its sweep all superstition and social abuse.  In such a
society there will be no Christian and non-Christian, there will be no
distinction of sex.  If best persons are women all ministers will belong
to that sex, if Parsis they will be all Parsis. That good day may be far
off.  What is to be done in the meanwhile?  Those who feel that they
are left out should have patience and rise by dint of service and merit.
Those who happen to be ministers should mete out even justice which
must include extra effort to raise the neglected and the downtrodden.
They should make all feel at every step that they are servants, not
masters, of the nation.

400.  MARCH  OF  CIVILIZATION
Q.On page 91 of Harijan 14-4-’46,1 it has been argued that the bullock is a
living machine and that contact with such harmless animals is a potent factor             
in the onward march of human civilization.  The animals are however, made
‘harmless’ by making them ‘impotent’.  Is this the correct method of the onward
march of civilization?  If we have cows, we must have bulls.  The bullock is a  
creation of human selfishness and cruelty.  If not in thinking man, in the lower
animals at any rate, all the force of their nature rages in the fury of the generative
desire.  Therefore, to turn the noble animal, the ‘Vahana  of Mahadev’2, into a beat of
burden is sad.
A.The writer is logical.  But such logic would prevent the
domestication of the cow.  For there is probably more cruelty in
domesticating the cow than in castrating the bull.  It is a question of
degree.  Further march of civilization seems to imply increasing
domination of man over beast, together with a growingly humane
method of using them.
There are three schools of humanitarians.  One believes in
replacing animal power by the use of any other.  Another believes in
treating animals as fellow-beings and making such use of them as a
brotherly spirit will permit.  The third will not make use of lower
animals for man’s selfish purpose but will employ instead one’s
power and that of fellow-beings to the extent that the latter give
intelligent and willing use.  I belong to the third school.  It is possible
1 In V. G. Desai’s article  “The Case for the Bullock”
2 Mount of Lord ShivaVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 327by human labour, judiciously and humanely employed, to do fruit
culture to a large extent and even corn culture.  Indeed, as prisoners
we civil resisters in the Transvaal dug up stony ground for converting
it into a municipal garden.  No ploughing would have answered the
purpose.  The ground could yield only to the pickaxe.
The first I hold to be useless and even injurious in the end to
mankind.  A judicious combination of the other two seems to me to
be the goal.  I can see no escape from castration.  The only thing to
be done is to make it progressively humane.
A correspondent has brought forward in this connection the
question of branding animals.  Does the pain caused by branding
compensate for the benefit it confers upon the owner and the       
animal?  If it confers none on the animal, naturally, branding must        
be taboo.

401.  INDEPENDENCE
Friends have repeatedly challenged me to define independence.
At the risk of repetition, I must say that the independence of my
dream means Ramarajya , i.e., the Kingdom of God on Earth. I do not
know what it will be like in Heaven.  I have no desire to know the
distant scene.  If the present is attractive enough, the future cannot be
very unlike.
In concrete terms, then, the independence should be political,
economic and moral.
‘Political’ necessarily means the removal of the control of the
British army in every shape and form.
‘Economic’ means entire freedom from British capitalists and
capital, as also their Indian counterparts.  In other words, the humblest
must feel eqaul to the tallest.  This can take place only by capital        
or capitalists sharing their skill and capital with the lowliest and       
the least.
‘Moral’ means freedom from armed defence forces. My
conception of Ramarajya excludes replacement of the British army
by a national army of occupation. A country that is governed by even
its national army can never be morally free and, therefore, its so-called
weakest member can never rise to his full moral height.328 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThough Mr. Churchill is claimed to have won the war for the
British, he has in his Aberdeen speech uttereed words of wisdom from
the standpoint of a radical non-violent reformer.  He knows, if any
panoplied warrior knows, what havoc the two wars of our generation
have  wrought.  In another column I reproduce the summary of his
speech as reported in the public Press.1  Only I must warn the public
against the pessimistic note underlying the speech.  Nothing will be
found to have gone wrong if mankind recoils from the horrors of war.
The bloodletting that men have undergone to the point of whiteness
will not have been  in vain, if it has taught us that we must freely give
our own blood in the place of taking other people’s blood, be the
cause ever so noble or ignoble.
If the Cabinet Mission ‘delivers the goods’, India will have to
decide whether attempting to become a military power she would be
content to become, at least for some years, a fifth-rate power in the
world without a message in answer to the pessimism described above,
or whether she will by further refining and continuing her non-violent
policy prove herself worthy of being the first nation in the world
using her hard-won freedom for the delivery of the earth from the
burden which is crushing her in spite of the so-called victory.,

402.  KANU  GANDHI’S  CAMP2
This issue contains an abridged account of Kanu Gandhi’s
second camp3.  How the candidates4 were selected, how there was no
financial loss, how beginning with cleaning latrines they carried out all
the other work, what they ate, etc., are all matters worthy of attention.
The smallest detail was not neglected.  The running of this camp will
serve as a guide to others who wish to organize or attend training
camps.
The secret of Kanu Gandhi’s camp lay, in my opinion, in the
fact that the organizers knew their job and were there as workers
rather than for issuing orders.  Where the organizers are mere
superintendents the work is often apt to be lifeless or slack.

training will utilize in their own lives the lessons they learnt and thus
make progress towards becoming perfect servants of the people.

Gandhiji’s Correspondence with the Government , 1944-47, pp. 184-5
1 According to the source “The reference is to the postponement of
negotiations at Delhi and the decision to hold a meeting instead with the represen-
tatives of the Congress and the Muslim League at Simla.  In the letter of invitation to
the Conference to be held at Simla, the Congress and the Muslim League were asked to
send representatives to enter into negotiation about a scheme based upon certain
‘fundamental principles’. Acceptance of the invitation thus implied acceptance of the
proposed basis.  This basis, Gandhiji felt, contained in it ‘the seeds of Pakistan’.
When he expressed his apprehension about this, the members of the Cabinet Mission
explained to him that by accepting the invitation the invitees committed themselves
to nothing, but the Mission had to word the letter of invitation as they had done to
bring in Jinnah.  To Gandhiji this smacked of ‘double talk’. He immediately alerted
his Congress colleagues and insisted upon their obtaining a clarification in writing
from the Cabinet Mision before they accepted the invitation.  This was done by an
exchange of letters between the Maulana Saheb and Lord Pethick-Lawrence on the
28th and 29th April, 1946.”

to persuade him to go to Simla.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 331406.  NOTE  TO  AMRIT  KAUR

Congress for discussions on the basis of a scheme which, inter alia,  envisaged “two
groups of Provinces, the one of the predominantly Hindu Provinces and the other of

objected to the classification of the Provinces in terms of “predominantly Hindu and
predominantly Muslim” and also to the term “sovereign” being applied to the
residuary rights. Pethick-Lawrence in his reply of April 28 expressed his inability to
make any “textual alterations” in the proposal as conveyed in his letter.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 333are committing a mistake.
You must also consider what you intend to do after the British
army withdraws. I cannot quite see what you could do.
You have announced that the present Working Committee will
continue till November and you will continue as president till then. If
you must continue, it does not seem proper that you should do so by
a ruling. Giving such a ruling seems to me dangerous thing to do. If it
becomes a duty to continue this can be done only through fresh
elections. This matter deserves consideration.

411.  TALK  WITH  MADAN  MOHAN  MALVIYA1
[April 29, 1946 ]2
In reply to Gandhiji’s question as to what he proposed  to do since the        
venue of the Cabinet Mission talks was going to be shifted to Simla,            
Malaviyaji said he would be returning to Benares.  That relieved Gandhiji as he was
half afraid lest in his irrespressible enthusiasm this enfant terrible should decide           
to venture up the heights of Simla.  That would be courting disaster at his age and       
in his present state of health.  Gandhiji asked him, marvelling at his perennial
freshness :
How long are you to continue to worry over the country’s      
affairs ?
“So long as the country’s affairs continue to cause worry,” he replied, with a
merry twinkle in his eyes.
Won’t you leave something to a youth like myself ? It will make
me even younger.
“This young man,” replied Malaviyaji in an audible whisper, his eyes beaming
at his visitor, “is going to remain young for many a day yet.”
You can entrust any of your burdens to me.  The only condition
is that you must cease worrying and bless me with some of your
strength.
1 Reproduced from Pyarelal’s report entitled “Seeking Blessings”.  Gandhiji
paid a visit to Malaviyaji before his departure for Simla and communicated in writing
as it was his silence day.
2ibid334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThe name of God is the strength of our strength.
That is true.  The recitation of Ramanama is there all the time.
But where from shall I bring your learning ?  I am not flattering.  I
have neither your erudition nor your knowledge of the Mahabharata
and the Bhagavata  lore.
But you have God’s name which is the quintessence of all knowledge.  Is it     
not ?
That is true, but all the same I do feel jealous of your learning.
But now you must get well and make use of all your learning to that
end.
I will get well.1
It is a national menace, this spread of vegetable ghee, on the one hand, and the
slaughter of the cows on the other.  Between the two the vitality of the people is
being sapped.  I feel so happy over what you have done and are doing for the milk
supply.
Gandhiji agreed with him as regards the menance of vegetable ghee and added :
My efforts to solve the milk problem, of course continue, but
success is not possible without the full co-operation of our
commercial and trading class.  But I must now take leave of you.
Malaviyaji smiled leave and blessings in reply, making namaskara  at the same
time.  As Gandhiji rose from his seat he (Malaviyaji) slowly recited the following
verse :
Forget not yourself,
But continue to spread your fragrance wherever you are,
Even like the rose.

May 1, 19463
The Government had thoughtfully placed at Gandhiji’s disposal a big
bungalow at Simla and made transport arrangements for him and his party.  Should he
avail himself of these without stint?  His faith in God and his detachment, he felt,
were on trial.  Further reduction in the staff seemed hardly feasible.  But did he hope to

had read out his article ‘Vanaspati and Ghee’ to his father and it had pleased him
immensely.”

members of his  party who were to accompany him to Simla.

instrument for carrying out the Divine Will, were outward trappings necessary for his
purpose ?
We are up against heavy odds. There is so much corruption,
falsehood and deceit all round.  How can I cut my way through it and
come out of it unscathed, except by the use of the sharp axe of
detachment. In this hour of trial I wish to put myself entirely  in
God’s hands and proceed to Simla all alone. But I do not want to do
so unless I can carry you with me.  To force my will upon you would
be the negation of detachment.
None or all, faith cannot be divided.  You cannot trust me to
God in part.  As the poet says, “What of faith in aught is want of faith
in all.”1

413.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING
NEW  DELHI,
May 1, 1946
Mahatma Gandhi referred to the British Cabinet Mission and said that the
Mission had come with good intentions, but that the extent of the Mission’s success
would depend on the people’s own strength and purity.  If they did not have these,
they were bound to be disappointed.
Mahatma Gandhi expressed regret that he had to leave for Simla.  Human nature
was such that one became attached to the environment.  The people of Delhi had been
very good and had joined the prayers whole-heartedly.  He said he was going to Simla
out of a sense of duty.  During summer his heart was at Mahabaleshwar.  Doctors had
advised him to spend two or three months in the hot weather at Mahabaleshwar or
Panchagani.  But he had to go to Simla instead, and he had to go by a special train
which was a matter of shame for him and for them.
Gandhiji said people crowded at stations, and their noisy affection
embarrassed him.  He wished to live up to the age of 125 years, yet he was an old man
and could not bear the din and the noise.  What did it matter if the Government paid
1 According to the source, the party members could not take upon themselves
the tremendous responsibility of letting Gandhiji go altogether unattended.  After a
hurried deliberation they communicated their unanimous decision to Gandhiji that if
he took with him three only, or Pyarelal along they would be satisfied.  However, the
whole party accompanied Gandhiji to Simla but was sent back ot Delhi soon after
their arrival.336 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthe fare for the special train?  The money came from the pockets of the poor.  Special
trains were used for high officials or dangerous prisoners.  He had to use them to
escape the loud expressions of affection.  It was their duty perhaps to go to stations
to see their leaders, but their affection must be subdued and disciplined.

414.  CERTAIN  QUESTIONS
A London friend has put seven questions on the working of
non-violence.  Though similar questions have been dealt with in
Young India  or Harijan, it is profitable to answer them in a single
article, if perchance the answers may prove helpful.
Q. 1.   Is it possible for a modern State (which is essentially based on force) to
offer non-violent resistance for countering internal as well as external forces of
disorder?  Or is it necessary that people wanting to offer non-violent resistance
should first of all divest themselves of State-authority and place themselves vis-a-vis
the opponent entirely in a private capacity?
A.It is not possible for a modern State based on force, non-
violently to resist forces of disorder, whether external or internal.A
man cannot serve God and Mammon, nor be ‘temperate and furious’
at the same time.  It is claimed that a State can be based on non-
violence, i. e., it can offer non-violent resistance against a world
combination based on armed force.  Such a State was Ashoka’s. The
example can be repeated. But the case does not become weak even if
it be shown that Ashoka’s State was not based on non-violence. It has
to be examined on its merits.
Q.  2.  Do you think that it would be possible for a Congress government       
to deal with foreign aggression or internal riots in an entirely non-violent      
manner?
A.It is certainly possible for a Congress government to deal
with “foreign aggression or internal riots” in a non-violent manner.
That the Congress may not share my belief is quite possible.  If the
Congress changes its course, the change will prove nothing save that
the non-violence hitherto offered was of the weak and that the
Congress has no faith in State non-violence.
Q.  3.  Does not the knowledge that the opponent is wedded to non-violence
often encourage the bully?
A.The bully has his opportunity when he has to face non-
violence of the weak.  Non-violence of the strong is any day strongerVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 337than that of the bravest soldier fully armed or a whole host.
Q.  4.  What policy would you advocate if a section of the Indian people tries to
enforce by sword a selfish measure which is not only repugnant to others but also
basically unjust?  While it is possible for an unofficial organization to offer non-
violent resistance in such a case, is it also possible for the government of the day to
do so?
A.The question assumes a case which can never exist.  A non-
violent State must be broad-based on the will of an intelligent people,
well able to know its mind and act up to it. In such a State the assumed
section can only be negligible. It can never stand against the delibe-
rate will of the overwhelming majority represented by the State. The
government of the day is not outside the people. It is the will of the
overwhelming majority. It it is expressed non-violently, it cannot be
majority of one but nearer 99 against one in a hundred.
Q.  5.  Is not non-violent resistance by the militarily strong more effective
than that by the militarily weak?
A.This is a contradiction in terms.  There can be no non-
violence offered by the militarily strong.  Thus, Russia in order to
express non-violence has to discard all her power of doing violence.
What is true is that if those, who were at one time strong in armed
might, change their mind, they will be better able to demonstrate their
non-violence to the world and, therefore, also to their opponents.
Those who are strong in non-violence will not mind whether they are
opposed by the militarily weak people or the strongest.
Q.  6.  What should be the training and discipline for a non-violent army?
Should not certain aspects of conventional military training form a part of the
syllabus?
A.A very small part of the preliminary training received by the
military is common to the non-violent army. These are discipline,
drill, singing in chorus, flag-hoisting, signalling and the like. Even this
is not absolutely necessary and the basis is different. The positively
necessary training for a non-violent army is an immovable faith in
God, willing and perfect obedience to the chief of the non-violent
army and perfect inward and outward co-operation between the units
of the army.
Q.  7.  Is it not better under the existing circumstances that countries like India
and England should maintain full military efficiency while resolving to give non-
violent resistance a reasonable trial before taking any military step?
A.The foregoing answers should make it clear that under no338 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcircumstance can India and England give non-violent resistance a
reasonable chance whilst they are both maintaining full military
efficiency. At the same time it is perfectly true that all military powers
carry on negotiations for peaceful adjustment of rival disputes. But
here we are not discussing preliminary peace parleys before appealing
to the arbitrament of war.  We are discussing a final substitute for
armed conflict called war, in naked terms, mass murder.

415.  A  SURE  AID
A correspondent suggests three aids to self-control, of which   
two are outward and one is inward.  The inward help he describes as
follows :1
There is no doubt that Ramanama is the surest aid.  If recited
from the heart it charms away every evil thought, and evil thought
gone, no corresponding action is possible.  The outward helps are all
useless if the mind is weak.  They are super-fluous if the mind is pure.
This must not be taken to mean that a pure-minded man can take all
the liberties and still keep safe. Such a man simply will not take any
liberties with himself. His whole life will be an infallible testimony to
the inward purity. The Gita truly says that the mind makes the man
and unmakes him. Milton paraphrases the same thought when he says:
The mind is its own place and in itself
Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.2

They get the best talent from the South at enormous cost for
the sake of amusement. The artists who preside are of
questionable morals.  All this at a religious festival.
This is a condensation of a correspondent’s letter.  When a man
begins a downward career, it is difficult to say where the deterioration

liquor.  The only way to stop this degradation of religious or for that
matter any celebrations is for the public not to patronize them.

417.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING1
SIMLA,
May 2, 1946
I did not know that I would have to come to Simla this time.  If
we have faith in God we simply would not care to know beforehand
how He may dispose of us.  It is enough for us to hold ourselves
perfectly in readiness for whatever happens.  We are not allowed to
know what tomorrow has in store for us and our best conceived plans
have a knack very often of going awry.  The highest wisdom therefore
is never to worry about the future but to resign ourselves entirely to
His Will.
I do not propose to say anything here about the Cabinet
Mission.  And I would like you, too, for your part, to repress your
curiosity about it.  Let us all mutely watch and pray.  As I told the
people, who attended the evening prayer gathering at Delhi yesterday,
the Cabinet Mission will not be able to go beyond what is warranted
by our strength.  We shall be fools to think otherwise.  Even if they
tried to go beyond, it would only cause us surfeit and we would not be
able to take advantage of it.  Therefore, even if the Mission should
prove infructuous I would not blame them for it.  Rather I would
blame ourselves for our weakness.  It would enable us to measure our
strength.  By strength I mean non-violent strength.  We are pledged to
gain swaraj non-violently.
Many people today share the belief, and I am one of them, that
this time the Cabinet Mission will do the right thing by India and that
the British power would finally and completely be withdrawn.  Time
alone will show how far this belief is justified.
Now to take up the question I want to talk to you about.          
Last time also I had mentioned it.  But truth is such a thing that          
one may repeat it from the house-tops any number of times without
1 The version from Pyarelal’s report, published under the title “Introspection”,
 is reproduced with alterations to bring it in conformity with the Hindi original.340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIgetting tired of it, just as one is not tired of repeating the name             
of God.  Hypocrites too have the name of God on their lips                 
but what we use is it if they carry a knife under their arms?  If   
Ramanama comes out of the heart one would never feel tired of it.  So
never mind if I repeat endlessly whatever I want to say.  It is bound to
have its impact on you.  The first mantra of the Ishopanishad  says
that God pervades the universe and it is man’s duty to surrender his
all to God in the first instance.  There is nothing which he can call his
own.  Having made the surrender man is to take out of it what he may
require for his legitimate needs but not a whit more.  He must not
covet what belongs to others.  Take my instance.  I have been housed
here in a palatial building.  For fear of your embarrassing affection I
had to seek Government’s hospitality and they put me up here.  That
however does not mean that since the Government have placed a big
bungalow at my disposal I am free to make use of the whole of it.
Tolstoy, in one of his inimitable parables, has answered the question,
how much land a man requires.  The Devil tempts a man by granting
him a boon that all the land that he can circumscribe by running
around shall be his.  The man runs and runs, goades by his greed and
in the end when the sun is just sinking below the horizon, he reaches
back the starting point only to drop down dead.  Six feet of the earth
is all the land that he requires for his burial.  If, therefore, I were to
delude myself with the belief that I needed the whole of this bungalow
and took possession of it, I would be set down as a fool.  Only a
perverse nature can interpret the verse to mean that after making a
ceremony of offering everything to God one can indulge oneself in
the good things of life to an unlimited extent.  That would be a
travesty of its true meaning.  I would far rather like to see a man
dressed in old, mended clothes than in gaudy new ones.  To wear torn
clothes is a sign of laziness and therefore a matter of shame, but to
wear patched clothes proclaims your poverty or renunciation and
industry.  Similarly, if someone gives me Rs. 25,000 and I spend it on
my person I am a robber and thief.  I can use only enough for my
bare needs.  That would be the teaching of the Ishopanishad .  If you
understand this you will achieve great things.

419.  IS  KHADI  TOTTERING?
To those who have no faith khadi is tottering.  In reality it is
gaining ground.  From being the poor man’s staff of life, it is trying
to become the non-violent means of gaining independence.  The
difficulty is fairly clearly expressed in the following paragraphs3 from
a letter from Tamil Nadu.
The A. I. S. A. is faced with two problems now.  The one is to keep on the
khadi production on the present methods.  The other is to give re-orientation
to our activity related to artisans and their villages where we seve.
The commercial production as it is, is seriously affected in the last few
months owing to competition of the uncertified merchants in khadi.  The
uncertified merchants buy the yarn from our spinners who spin with better
cotton supplied by us.  They buy khadi woven by the weavers... for by giving
extra wages . . . . The khadi thus bought is sold . . . at higher    prices.
There are more than fifty uncertified khadi dealers in this area.             
Among these are Congressmen also, who occupy places in the Congress
Executive.
We are not able to influence the artisans against being exploited by the
uncertified merchants.  They simply say that they are not able to resist the
temptation of higher wages for inferior labour and with no conditons that we
impose with regard to quality and their wearing khadi, etc. . . . .
This tendency among the artisans is a great impediment and obstacle in
approaching them with our ideal of village reconstruction through the
charkha.
The present method of khadi production has to be sacrificed if
1 This is written on a letter from Premabehn Kantak dated May 2, 1946.
2 ibid
3 Of which only extracts are reproduced here342 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIit hinders re-orientation.  This requires faith and alertness which faith
brings.  Faith never accrues to the lazy.
Uncertified khadi dealers are a powerful menace to khadi
whether from the standpoint of the poor man or of non-violence.  For
the dealer knows only his own pocket and nothing else matters to him.
Of course, he goes to the weaver and the spinner and makes all kinds         
of promises, not knowing that if he killed the A. I. S. A. he would        
kill himself.
The pity of it all is that Congressmen become willing tools in the
hands of these uncertified dealers.  They have brought into being an
association of specialists.  Yet they do not know that they are willingly
or unwillingly killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  They have a
right to do so in any case, more so if they do not believe in khadi as
the non-violent insturment of swaraj.
It has been suggested to me that the policy of the A. I. S. A. can
be changed only after consultation with Congressmen.  This is wrong
in the nature of things.  The A. I. S. A. is composed of Congressmen.
Though created by the Congress, it is an autonomous body.  It can be
disowned by the Congress at any time but while it is owned it must be
trusted to do the right thing in terms of swaraj.  Part payment in yarn
is a potent cause of worry to Congressmen.  This should not be so, if
they believe that khadi is a symbol of non-violence and all that it
implies.  If such is not the belief the clause about compulsory wear of
khadi should be given up.
Moreover, khadi furnishes the acid test of public honesty.  It is a
great effort to find the best way of inducing honesty in public
dealings, for it means coming in close and selfless touch with the
millions of men and women in the villages.
The upshot of it all is that workers like the writer have to carry
on their work with full faith in their mission and leave the result in the
hands of God.

The world will laugh at me and say, ‘Here is a theatrical man.’  I

oneself away from them all of a sudden.  I very conservative in my
feelings.  I have spent half a day in searching for a small bit of pencil
which had been with me for a long time.  I could not reconcile myself
to its loss.  And here I have to detach myself from my entire
surroundings and send away a party whom I have trained and
seasoned for my work for years—no easy job.
It should not be so.  All should be same to one who has
surrendered his all to God.  My Ramanama will be vain repetition and
I would be a wretched guide for the Congress, the Cabinet Mission
and others, if I allowed that feeling of attachment to weigh with me.  If
they follow my advice it might be like a plunge in the dark.  As
seasoned politicians they cannot afford to take that risk.  My guidance
must, therefore, be unalloyed.
If you are surrounded by your family, they divide your
attention in however small or subtle a measure.  I wish in this crisis to

It remains to be seen how I come out of the test.  So far people
around me had attended to every little thing for me.  If anything went
wrong they were responsible.  From tomorrow I shall have to do all
that myself and blame myself only, if anything goes wrong.  With all
that I must feel at ease with myself.  I shall have to watch myself.  It
will be a great thing if I survive that detachment and feel the inner
joy—not start running high blood-pressure.  It is a big experiment in
my life and a necessary stage in my spiritual growth.

425.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING
SIMLA,
May 3, 1946
I am grieved to know about the immorality prevalent among the
people of Simla and its surrounding hills.  Simla is the summer capital
of the British Government and immorality is a feature common to all
capitals.  But it does not absolve us from our responsibility.  Those
who follow immoral ways can be nowhere near God.  As in other
places, in Simla as well, there is a wide chasm separating man from
man.  Harijan huts are situated adjacent to the Viceregal mansion.
I do not believe in having spearate quarters for Bhangis.  Those
who make it possible for us to live (in sanitary conditons) should have
the opportunity to live in open and in the best of localities to enable
them to set an ideal in sanitation.  But out of sheer callousness we treat
them cruelly.  Their condition will certainly improve provided every
one of us treated them as our own kith and kin.
Mahatma Gandhi urged the people of Simla to eradicate corruption and to give
up the desire to do evil things.
Gandhiji said they were probably wondering why he was living at    
“Chadwick”.  He had come to simla at the instance of the Cabinet Mission,              
who had arranged for his accommodation.  He would, however, assure the people that
he or any member of his party was using no more room in that big building than they
did elsewhere.  That was why he had asked Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and others to stay
with him.346 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIMahatma Gandhi pleaded for amelioration of the living conditions of Harijans
and said if everyone decided to take one Harijan to live with him the problem could be
solved.

SIMLA,
May 4, 1946
Pressmen are inquiring already why my large party is going
back.  This is a personal question.  I would rather avoid answering it,
but in these days of publicity and speculation the question can not be
evaded. The reason is purely moral, if it may not be described as
spiritual. My task as a self-appointed adviser to all the parties
concerned is the most delicate at the present moment. The Simla
venue was declared all of a sudden.  It dawned on me that if I was to
go to Simla, I must go without the usual party, even though Harijan
work might suffer.  Had I succeeded in carrying conviction to the
members of my party, they would have remained behind in Delhi.1
The time within which the decision was to be taken was only a few
hours on the 1st instant.  They were anxious for my well-being.  The
whole moral purpose would be defeated, if I did not carry their mind
with me.  They, therefore, came to Simla.  But the matter was still
agitating me. So I conferred with Pyarelal yesterday.2 He felt
convinced that I should be left free to put myself solely in God’s
keeping, if I was to work under as much detachment as was possible
for me.  The best part of the afternoon was devoted to prayerful
discussion that the party should go back to the heat of Delhi and await
me there to rejoin me when I descended.  This is the sole reason
without reservation.

May 4, 1946
Gandhiji explained to the audience how his permanent staff had shortly before
left Delhi with smiling faces and his blessings. His task was very hard. But all
difficulties could be overcome by leaning on God.  Ever since he had reached the years
of discretion he had felt that God is always with those who wait on Him.
In reality He is everywhere but because He is formless and
invisible, man cannot always sense His presence. But if we have listen-
ing ears, God speaks to us in our own language, whatever that
language be.
Badshah Khan had just explained what prayer was.  God was all-powerful.  Man
lives at His will.  It was because Gandhiji wanted in these crucial days to rely solely
on His help that he had asked his people who looked after his every need and helped
him to edit the Harijan weeklies to leave him to God.  Yet he was not quite without
human help.  He had the Fakir Badshah Khan with him, the Sardar and his daughter3,

The British have to end their rule and quit India.  They have
promised to do so.  Yet we should recognize the fact that a handful of
Englishmen have been ruling over us.  It is shameful not only for us
but also for Englishmen.  It is because of this feeling of shame that
they have resolved to quit and go.  That is why I say that their task is
the hardest.
I have come here to advise the Congress and I am well aware of
the fact that the Congress has always respected and listened to my
counsel. If the Muslim League seeks my advice I shall gladly give it to
them.  I have to guide the Cabinet Mission as well.  I know my task is
difficult and equally arduous is the task of the Congress and the
Muslim League.  But the task of the Cabinet Mission is even more
difficult.  There are  a few persons who are suspicious of the Cabinet
Mission and who  are afraid that the Mission might betray us.  In my
opinion it is quite wrong to think so.  I have faith in the sincerity of
the Cabinet Mission and in their avowed intention of giving up power.
Gandhiji warned people against believing that Britain was crumbling.
It is a great power.

431.  A  HARIJAN’S  LETTER1
A Harijan friend complains bitterly about my article on
sweepers’ strike2.
His first complaint is that I have given up the sweet name
‘Harijan’ and used “Bhangi” instead. The criticism shows the sensi-
tive nature of the correspondent.  It was a Gujarati untouchable in the
first instance, who suggested the name ‘Harijan’ to me and I willingly
adopted it.  This does not, however, mean that a current word for any
sub-caste may never be used.  I count myself a Harijan and it pleases
me to call myself a Bhangi among them, because that is the lowest
caste of Harijans.  When I stayed recently in the sweepers’ quarters in
Delhi, the Harijans there too complained against the use of the word
‘Bhangi’. They suggested ‘Mehtar’. I tried to make them understand
that it mattered  little as to which of the current words was used for the
same occupation.  In spite of being considered the lowest occupation,
it was in fact the highest inasmuch as it protected health and they
should be indifferent to the name. Whatever the origin of the word
may be, ‘Bhangi’ is, in my opinion, another name for ‘Shivji’3.
Whether you call a sweeper a Mehtar or a ‘Bhangi’, like ‘Shivji’ he

3 Lord Shiva350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIbrings health to man.  The one brings it by keeping the home clean,
the other cleanses the mind of man.
The second criticism is more serious. Prejudice are respon-     
sible for misunderstandings. If we take by force even that to which we
are entitled, the action is likely to lead to a quarrel. We may not even
be able to digest what we get by force.  The  strikers got what they did
by coercion.  At least, that is my  belief.  If my occupation is to keep
latrines clean and I refused to do the work, can it be termed anything
other than coercion?  Of course, I am not bound to take up the job of
cleaning latrines and I may be said to have every right to lay down my
conditions of service. But according to my way of thinking, the laying
down of conditions is not an absolute right.  Even if such an absolute
right were to be permitted, it might not be proper to use it under
certain circumstances. But I do not want to enter into the justification
of this reasoning. I tried to show in my article the duties of Bhangis as
well as of citizens. I have often said that every kind of injustice is
meted out to Bhangis. I have no doubt that citizens do not fulfil their
obligations to them.1Thus it is their duty to see that Harijan dwellings
are built properly, the means employed for cleaning are decent, that
they have a special working uniform given to them, that they and their
children have facilities for education, etc. These and other problems
should be solved without loss of time. The Bhangis may not go on
strike for lack of these amenities but it is up to all citizens to raise their
voice on behalf of them.
Yet another criticism is directed against my suggestion of the
use of the military to do sweepers’ work.  I do not see any wrong in
what I said.  I have reread my article and am not willing to withdraw
one single word of it.  I do not regret having written as I did.  I advise
Harijan friends to read it in the proper spirit.  If they do so, they will
see that my feelings on their behalf have undergone no change.

or not, citizens ought to fulfil their duty independently.  I have already explained
what their duty is.”
2 The Hindi original of this appeared in Harijan Sevak , 12-5-1946.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 351whether these donations should be accepted for your work.  The
donors certainly get a name thereby and among them might
even be black marketeers.  Can such charity benefit the poor?
The question really boils down to whether donations are in
themselves wrong.  I have no doubt in my mind about their being so.
But the world works differently.  The author of the Gita has said that
all undertakings are tainted.1Therefore, all action should be performed
with complete detachment.  The Ishopanishad begins by saying that
all action must be preceded by a full surrender of everything to God.
It must, however, be admitted that even if everyone ceased to receive
charity, the rich would not cease to amass wealth.  It is also a fact that
some rich people are stingy enough never to give anything in charity.
Some even give money for nefarious purposes.  Therefore, all that
one can say is that certain principles should be observed in the matter
of receiving charity.  Not one pie should be taken for selfish ends and
all should be received with God as witness.
I do, however, hold that it would be wrong to receive money
from any group or individual whom the recipient considers to be
unworthy.  The discussion is naturally relevant only for those who are
troubled by concientious scruples.

437.  TO  CORRESPONDENTS2
My daily post may be said to have increased fourfold since the
Harijan weeklies started.  It is impossible to answer every letter.  Every
communication is read but not by me.  If I attempted to do so I would
be unable to render any service.  My staff put before me only what I
should see.  Much of the post does not merit replies, but questions of
public interest are answered in Harijan.  Personal correspondence has
to be rigidly restricted. I receive a large number of requests for
blessings on the occasion of marriages which I am hesitant to send.  I
have already stated publicly that my blessings should be asked for
only such marriages where one of the contracting parties is a Harijan.
But in reality where is the need for blessings?  Those marriages which
are undertaken for the sake of joint service carry their own blessings.
Those entered upon for self-satisfaction are wholly unworthy of any.
In any event, in these days of famine, no money should be spent on
feasts and enjoyment.  Weddings will continue, but is it not possible
for the event to take place quietly and without fuss?

It was the heroism and travail of Bardoli that brought to public
life men like Shri Bhulabhai Desai.  He might otherwise have
remained a distinguished Government servant and ended his career as
a judge of the Bombay High Court.  He reached the heights of fame
when his forensic talents resulted in the release of the I.N.A. prisoners.
His son and daughter-in-law have in me, like many others, a co-sharer
in their grief which it is to be hoped they will turn into joy by
inheriting the deceased’s love for the country’s service, which alone

Confidential THE  RETREAT,
SIMLA,
May 6, 1946
DEAR  LORD  PETHICK-LAWRENCE ,
My colleagues and I followed with care the proceedings of the Conference
yesterday and tried to understand what our conversations were leading us to.  I confess
to feeling somewhat mystified and disturbed at the vagueness of our talks and some of
the assumptions underlying them.  While we would like to associate ourselves with
every effort to explore ways and means of finding a basis for agreement, we must      
not deceive ourselves, the Cabinet Mission or the representatives of the Muslim
League into the belief that the way the Conference has so far proceeded furnishes
hope of success.  Our general approach to the questions before us was stated      
briefly in my letter to you of April 28.  We find that this approach has been     
largely ignored and a contrary method has been followed.  We realize that some
1Which occurred on May 6

3 This was drafted for Abul Kalam Azad by Jawaharlal Nehru and was revised by
Gandhiji.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 355assumtions have to be made in the early stages as otherwise there can be no   
progress.  But assumptions which ignore or run contrary to1 fundamental issues are
likely to lead to misunderstandings during the later stages.
In my letter of April 28, I stated that the basic issue before us was that of
Indian independence and the consequent withdrawal of the British army from India, for
there can be no independence so long as there is foreign army on Indian soil.  We
stand for the independence of the whole of India now and not in the distant or near
futre.  Other matters are subsidiary to this and can be fully discussed and decided by the
Constituent Assembly.
At the Conference yesterday I referred to this again and we were glad to find
that you and your colleagues, as well as the other members of the Conference,
accepted independence as the basis of our talks.  It was stated by you that the
Constituent Assembly would finally decide about the nexus or other relationship that
might be established between a free India and England.  While this is perfectly true, it
does not affect the position now and that is, the acceptance of Indian independence
now.
If that is so, then certain consequences inevitably follow.  We felt yesterday
that there was no appreciation of these consequences.  The Constituent Assembly is
not going to decide the question of independence; that question must be and, we take
it, has been decided now.  That Assembly will represent the will of the free Indian
nation and give effect to it.  It is not going to be bound by any previous
arrangements.  It has to be preceded by a Provisional Government, which must
function, as far as possible, as a Government of free India, and which should
undertake to make all arrangements for the transitional period.
In our discussions yesterday repeated references were made to ‘groups’ of
provinces functioning together, and it was even suggested that such group would have
an executive and legislative machinery.  This method grouping has not so far been
discussed by us but still our talks seemed to presume all this.  I should like to make it
very clear that we are entirely opposed to any executive or legislative machinery for a
group of provinces or units of the Federation.  That will mean a sub-federation, if not
something more, and we have already told you that we do not accept this.  It would
result in creating three layers of executive and legislative bodies, an arrangement
which will be cumbrous, static and disjointed, leading to continuous friction.  We are
not aware of any such arrangement in any country.
We are emphatically of the opinion that it is not open to the
Conference to entertain any suggestions for a division of India.  If
that is to come, it should come through the Constituent Assembly free
of any infuence of the present Paramount Power.2
Another point we wish to make clear is that we do not accept the proposal for
1 The words in italics are in Gandhiji’s hand.
2 This paragraph is in Gandhiji’s hand.356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIparity as between groups in regard to the executive or the legislature.  We realize that
everything possible should be done to remove fears and suspicions from the mind of
every group and community.  But the way to do this is not by unreal methods which
go against the basic principles of democracy on which we hope to build up our
constitution.
Yours sincerely,

SIMLA,
May 6, 1946
CHI.  MANILAL ,
I got your letter, in fact, two letters.  I see that your work is
progressing well.  No good work is accomplished in a day.  A job that
can be finished in one day cannot be of much value.  We must,
therefore, cultivate patience, and for that we should learn non-
attachment.  Non-attachment implies faith that only good results can
follow from good actions.  This firm faith should make us indifferent
to the results.  We are certain that the  sun will rise tomorrow and do
not worry.  We should  have  still deeper faith about the results of
good works.  There is bound to come a day when the sun will not rise;
but there can be no time when a good deed will not bear good fruit.
Hence you should go on with your work in the faith that the people
will one day see its merit.  Sanitation comes first, because it covers
most of the other things.
I do not have your letter before me while writing these lines.  If,
therefore, I have missed any point, ask me again.

SIMLA,
May 6, 1946
Noise is not erased by making greater noise.  It can only be
stilled by people making mute signs and never pushing forward.
Peace and order are necessary at all gatherings, but are especially so at
prayer gatherings.  People come together for prayers in order to
obtain peace, to hear God’s name and to recite it.  Therefore, those
who come should really attune themselves even as they start from their
homes.  Let them be silent and let their thoughts dwell as they walk,
on prayer.  Otherwise coming to prayers is useless.2
Mahatma Gandhi hoped that, in future, all would try to follow what he had said
and thus derive full benefit from attending prayers.

National Provincial Governments are now in full swing in India.
Happily on the question of prohibition, there can be no differences of
1 Reproduced from Pyarelal’s report “A Simla Diary” in Harijan.  As Gandhiji
was observing silence this was read out at the meeting.
2 The following paragraph is from The Hindu .VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 363opinion between the Congress and the Muslim League.  And if all
followed a concrete policy and the States too joined in, India would
be dry in no time and earn the blessings of lakhs of homes.  To the    
discredit of the Governments under virtual martial law, Governors      
and their Advisers had the shamelessness to reverse the policy which   
had been already adopted in some provinces and misappropriate the
revenue which was raised by the provinces in question. Let them    
now take up prohibition with prohibition legislation.  They have to
devise methods of educating the drinking public in the harm that       
drink does and privide them with innocent recreation and health-
giving drinks.  Every bar or, failing that, a place next door to it,
should, so far as possible, be utilized as a refreshment and recreation
room.  If this constructive activity is taken up, it must prove a source
of revenue for the State, besides prohibition, benefiting and
reconstructing thousands of ruined homes.
Moreover, toddy-tapping should be replaced by nira-tapping
for the purpose of converting nira into gur, much to the advantage of
the nation which needs cheap sugar.  These columns have shown how
in some ways tad-gur is preferable to cane- gur.
These reflections are suggested by the following paragraph
from a circular letter addressed by the Women’s Christian
Temperance Union (Fyzabad Road, Lucknow) to the Press.  From it, I
take the following items1 addressed to the students under the heading
“What Can Youth Do?”
1.Pledge themselves to total abstinence from all intoxicants and habit-
forming drugs, which includes tobacoo. . . .
2.Demand a thorough alcohol and narcotic drugs education, to be a part
of the school curriculum.
3.Demand while under training a part in social service, including
temperance work, educating the public of the harm done to them through the
use of the intoxicants.
4.Recommend that in the scheme for small savings campaign for rural
population, total abstinence from all intoxicants be stressed.
5.Ally themselves against the awful waste of precious foodstuffs for
liquor in breweries and distilleries.
6.Join up with a temperance society. . . .
7.Make use of temperance literature. . . .

imagined that because his staff had left, the negotiations had broken down.  This too
was wholly untrue.  They left, as Gandhiji had said before2, because they understood
that he wanted to be alone with God as his only help.  Even so he was not without
help.  It had been so throughtout his life.  In South Africa, too, all kinds of people
had helped him including Boers, Africans and Europeans.
The address . . . contained a scathing denunciation of the speculation fever
which had seized Simla.  He interpreted it as a sign of cowardice.  He tried to impress
upon them that it arose from fear.  He himself was a coward in his early youth.  He had
learnt to shed his cowardice through the recitation of Ramanama.3  It was cowards who
died many times before their death.  Fear of disease killed more men that disease
itself.  He appealed to newspapermen also not to spread false news.  It was their duty
to teach people to be brave and not instil fear into them.  The Cabinet Mission had
come with the blessings of the Prime Minister, who had said they were coming here
to part with power whether Indians agreed among themselves or not.  It was not right
to distrust or disbelieve anyone so long as there was no cause to do so.  Were those
who had had the courage to put up a non-violent fight against a mighty empire for 25
years going to yield to frustration if the British Government failed to perform its duty
today?4
That would be unworthy of those who had vowed their all to serve the country.
They had said the country was theirs and they were going to make her free.  If they had
fear in them, freedom could never be theirs.  The strength that withstands all fear is
derived from God.  When Gandhiji said he knew no fear, it was not because he was a
mahatma .  He was not different from any of them.  The only difference that there

sacrifice and fear nothing, relying solely on God.

NON-VIOLENCE  AND  KHADI
The Congress Constitution is undergoing a radical change.  The
supreme change that is desirable for the sake of avoiding untruth and
hypocrisy is to remove the words “legitimate and peaceful” from the
first article of the Congress Constitution as also the clause about
khadi.1 Experience shows that the people who form the bulk of
Congressmen are not wedded either to truth and non-violence or to
khadi.  As an ardent lover of truth and non-violence and khadi as
their symbol, I make bold to suggest that these clauses should go.  It
will be open to anyone to be truthful and non-violent and to wear
khadi if he or she chooses to.  Only there will be no deception
practised on India or the world.  Paradoxical as it may appear we shall
be more truthful2, more non-violent and better khadi-lovers with the
suggested amendment than without.  It should be remembered that I
myself had at one time moved the removal of these clauses.  I was
glad I was defeated.  It was wrong to be glad.  I shall be sorry if my
suggestion is rejected even now.  Let it not be said of us that we prize
hypocrisy above truth.
COCKTAIL  PARTIES
We seem to be on the eve of attaining independence!  Should         
we ape bad European manner and customs and still prize in-    
dependence?  It would be a sad day for India and the world, if  the
price we are to pay for independence is cocktail parties and the like.
What do the famishing millions know of such parties?  Let it not be
said of us that our monied men were gay whilst those from whom they
made money were famishing for food.
HARIJAN  COOKS
A correspondent suggests that at the next session of the
Congress all the cooks should be Harijans and to that end a corps of

the art of cooking scientifically and as behoves a poor country like
ours. He would have this privilege and duty given to the Congressmen
in the province in which the Congress session is to be held.  After the
session these cooks should be taken over by those Congressmen who
can afford it and keep cooks.  Any suggestion like this which shows in
practice that untouchability is a thing of the past is to be welcomed.  I
would only add that Concressmen who endorse it need not wait for the
session.  They should from now take up Harijans not merely as their
cooks but have them in all other capacities.  What is more, let those
who can afford it take Harijans in their families as their own children
and give them proper training.  All this can only happen if men and
women are sincere in their professions and if the truth had gone home
that under the garb of religion Hinduism is said to have consigned to
untouchability their own kith and kin for no fault of theirs.

Q.The Congress Constitution makes it incumbent on all its candidates
standing for election to be habitual wearers of hand-spun and hand-woven             
khadi.  Does this not imply that they can only use that khadi which is certified by the
A. I. S. A?
A.In my opinion it cannot be otherwise.
Q.Is s dealer in uncertified khadi eligible to hold offer in a Congress
committee?
A.It is beyond my conception as to how a dealer in uncertified
khadi can be a Congressman, leave alone an aspirant, for holding
office in any Congress Committee.
Q.You say that a dealer in uncertified khadi cannot even be a Congressman
much less an office-holder.  But what about those who are office-holders in the
Congress and who deal in mill cloth and even sell foreign cloth?
A.My answer to the second question is equally applicable to
the persons referred to in the third.  It is for these very reasons that I
have recommended the removal of the relevant clauses from the
Congress Constitution.2  Experience has taught us that we are unable

CHADWICK ,  SMILA  WEST,
May 8, 1946
DEAR  SIR  STAFFORD ,
The four Congress delegates1 had a warm debate over the
Cabinet Mission’s suggestion2.  The foremost was that if the delegates
accepted it, it was binding on them and its terms were binding on them
and therefore the Congress unless the latter repudiated them.  The
same would be the case with the League.  On the strength of what you
told me last night3 I said they were binding on no one. The Consti-
tuent Assembly would be free to throw out any of the items and the
members of the two delegations were equally free to add to or amend
the suggestions before the Constituent Assembly.  I added that
theywere meant only as a scaffolding by means of which the two
institutions could be brought to the Constituent Assembly adumbrated
in the draft.  If you are able to confirm the above and are free to
make a public declaration to that effect, the main difficulty would be
over.
As to merits, the difficulty about parity between six Hindu
majority Provinces and the five Muslim majority Provinces is
insurmountable. The Muslim majority Provinces represent over        
nine crores of the population as against over 19 crores of the          
Hindu   majority   Provinces.    This   is   really   worse  than  Pakistan.
What is suggested in [its] place is that the Central Legislature should
be framed on the population basis and so too the executive.  If this is
considered unfair, an impartial non-British tribunal should award on
this as on many other matters of difference otherwise incapable of
adjustment.  If these two points are cleared my way would be clear.4

SIMLA,
May 8, 1946
Mahatma Gandhi said at the outset that as it was Gurudev’s1 birthday he could
speak on nothing but him.2
A picture of the poet had been put on the dais at the prayer gathering.  Drawing
the attention of the gathering to it, Gandhiji said that the inscription under it was the
motto ‘The light that never failed’.  Gurudev’s body was reduced to ashes but the
radiance that had been within him was like the sun which would shine so long as life
on this earth lasted.  But the light he shed was for the soul as the sun’s was for the
body.
He was a poet and a literary star of the first magnitude.  He
wrote in his mother tongue and all Bengal is able to drink deep at the
fountain of his poetry.  Translations of his works exist in many
languages.  He was a great writer in English too, perhaps almost
without knowing it.  He had school education but he could boast of
no university degree. He was just Gurudev.  Our Viceroy had called
him the Poet of Asia, a  title that no one before him had had.  He was
also a world poet and, what is more, a rishi3.
He has left up the Gitanjali, the poems which brought him world
fame.  The great Tulsidas left us his immortal Ramayana .  The
renowned Vedavyasa left us a history of mankind4.  They were not
mere poets; they were teachers.  Gurudev too wrote not only as a poet
but as a rishi.  Writing, however, was not his only gift.  He was an artist,
a dancer, a singer, with all the sweetness and purity that art in its finest
sense  should contain. His creative genius has also given us Santini-
ketan, Sriniketan and Visvabharati. These breathe his spirit and are a
legacy not only to Bengal but to India. Santiniketan has become, as it
were, a  place of pilgrimage to us all.  He was not, in his lifetime, able
to make of these institutions what he had dreamed for them. What
man can? Fulfilment of man’s purpose is in God’s hands.  But they
are monuments to his endeavour and are a constant reminder to us of

has found a place in our national life.  How often is the inspiring
refrain heard from thousands of voices!  It is not only a song but is
also like a devotional hymn.
Gandhiji ended by exhorting the people to learn the lessons of love of the
country, love of the world and selfless service from the noble example which Gurudev
had left.

465.  AYURVEDA  AND  NATURE  CURE1
Vaidya Vallabhram, Professor of Ayurveda and Vanaspati
Shastra2 writes :3
Cure through Ayurveda is based on the five elements. . . . Pathya (diet cure) is a
scientific term of the greatest importance in Ayurveda.  Its real meaning is that
freedom from disease depends on a proper observance of the laws of nature.
I have no doubt whatsoever that the repetition of Ramanama and
pure living are the best and the cheapest preventives of disease.  The
tragedy is that doctors, hakims and vaidyas do not make use of
Ramanama as the sovereign of cures.  There is no place given to it in
current Ayurvedic literature except in the shape of a charm which will
drive people further into the well of superstition. Ramanama has        
in fact no connection with superstition. It is nature’s supreme law.
Whoever observes it is free from disease and vice versa .  The same law
which keeps one free from disease applies also to its cure.  An apt
question is as to why a man who recites Ramanama regularly and     
leads a pure life should ever fall ill.  Man is by nature imperfect.  A
thoughtful man strives after perfection, but seldom attains it, for he
stumbles on the way, though unwittingly. The whole of God’s law     
is embodies in a pure life.  The first thing is to realize one’s limi-
tations. It should be obvious that the moment one transgresses       
those limits one falls ill. Thus a balanced diet eaten in accordance with
needs gives one freedom from disease.  How is one to know what is
the proper diet for one?  Many such problems can be imagined.  The
purport of all this is that everyone should be his own doctor and find

of 125.
Vaidya Vallabhram asks whether well-known home drugs and
condiments can be included in nature cure.  Doctor friends claim that
they do nothing more than investigate the laws and act accordingly
and that therefore they are the best nature-cure men.  Everything can
be explained away in this manner.  All I want to say is that anything
more than Ramanama is really contrary to true nature cure.  The more
one recedes from this central principle the farther away one goes from
nature cure.  Following this line of thought I limit nature cure to the
use of the five elements.  But a vaidya who goes beyond this and uses
such herbs as grow or can be grown in his neighbourhood purely for
service of the sick and not for money may claim to be a nature-cure
man.  But where are such vaidyas to be found?  Today most of them
are engaged in making money.  They do no research work and it is
because of their greed and mental laziness that the science of
Ayurveda is at a low ebb.  Instead of admitting their own weakness
they throw the blame on Government and public men.  Government is
powerless to help those who through their own fault become helpless
and thereby drag the name of Ayurveda in the mud.

466.  HOW  CAN  VIOLENCE  BE  STOPPED?1
Q.Some time back a military officer in Poona, who is about to                                                        
return to England, said to me that violence was on the increase in India                                       
and would further increase as people were gradually turning away from the                                                        
path of non-violence.  “We in the West”, he said, “not only believe in vio-                             
lence but our society is based on it. Several subject races have won their independence
through violence and are today living in peace. We have dis-                                
covered the atom bomb for stopping violence.  The last great war is a case                                                        
in   point.”2     Continuing,   the   military   officer   said,   “Gandhiji  has  shown  your
people the way of non-violence.  Has he discovered any such power as the atom bomb
which will at once convert people to non-violence and bring about a rule of peace?
Cannot Gandhiji’s ‘atom bomb’ stop people from following the path of violence?
Ask Gandhiji to exercise his power over the people and tell them to give up all

2 The Hindi here adds : “The world has seen how with the help of the atom
bomb we stopped the bloody war in no time.”374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthoughts of violence and adopt his creed.  If he cannot wean his people today from the
terrible violence that is spreading all over the country, I tell you that he will live a
disappointed man and his life’s work will be ruined.”1
A.There is much confusion of thought in this question.  The
atom bomb has not stopped violence.  People’s hearts are full of it
and preparations for a third world war may even be said to be going
on.  While it would be absurd to say that violence has ever brought
peace to mankind it cannot either be said that violence never achieves
anything.
That I shall have to repent if I cannot stop violence does not
enter into the picture of non-violence.  No man can stop violence,
God alone can do so.  Men are but instruments in His hands.  Here
material means cannot stop violence but this does not mean that
material means should not be employed for the purpose. The
deciding factor is God’s grace.2   He works according to His law and,
therefore, violence will also be stopped in accordance with that law.
Man does not and can never know God’s law fully.  Therefore we
have to try as far as lies in our power.  I hold that our experiment in
non-violence has succeeded to a fair extent in India. There is,
therefore, no room for the passimism shown in the question. Finally
ahimsa is one of the world’s great principles which no power on earth
can wipe out.  Thousands like myself may die in trying to vindicate
the ideal but ahimsa will never die.  And the gospel of ahimsa can be
spread only through believers dying for the cause.

Shri Viththaldas Jerajani is one of those who will do his utmost
to put into practice what he is once convinced is the right thing to do.
When I returned home in 1915 from South Africa after 20 years’
exile, he was at that time running a large swadeshi store in Bombay.  I
explained to him that he was dealing in what was ‘swadeshi’ only in
name.  It was not difficult for him to understand that he had been
1 The Hindi here adds : “I hope you will clear the British officer’s doubt.”
2 The Hindi here adds : “Even when it stops while material means are employed
it will have stopped by God’s grace.  Yes, I will concede that God’s grace is a
conventional phrase.”
3 The Gujarati original of this appeared in Harijanbandhu , 19-5-1946.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 375labouring under a delusion but it was not clear to him what he should
do.  Beyond pointing out the flaw I too was unable to give him
practical guidance straightaway.  But I could not remain content
without making efforts to put into practice what I believed.  As soon
as possible I threw myself heart and soul into producing khadi and
Shri Viththaldas started business in khadi sales.  At that time all the
khadi that was produced was sold in Bombay.  Khadi weavers in the
production areas could be counted on the fingers of one hand.  The
history of the gradual growth of khadi is very interesting but I may
not dwell on it here.
Now that it has been realized that khadi merely as a commercial
commodity has been a mistake, Shri Viththaldas has taken another
step forward.  I give below the gist of his account of his doings which
he has described in a Gujarati letter to me :
I have already informed you that two out of the original
four Khadi Bhandars in Bombay have been converted into
teaching centres.  Instead of windows dressed with attractive
khadi for purposes of sales, people are treated to look at all the
implements of khadi production beginning from cotton right up
to yarn.  Those who are tempted to gain practical knowledge
enter the showrooms and are given instruction should they so
desire.  Up till now there are 209 pupils and the attendance is
fairly good for learning all the processes.  Shri Kakubhai has
taken up the work with zest and is devoting all his time to it.
For weaving we could only get one place in Andheri         
where we have put up looms.  Owing to the difficulty of pro-
curing accommodation in Bombay, half the shop on Kalba-      
devi Road has been turned into a weaving centre also.  The    
services of an expert have been obtained.  It remains to be seen
how far we can progress in this line.
During the war khadi sales mounted high owing to cloth
shortage.  Today also cloth for everyday needs is hard to get
and other cloth has gone into the black market and fetches
fantastic prices.  Khadi is, therefore, still considered cheap and if
it weren’t for the fact that yarn currency even to a limited extent
is in vogue we simply could not have met the demand nor could
have coped with the rush on our stores.  The danger of khadi
going into the black market might even have been there.
Politcal awakening has always connoted a pari passu376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIincrease in the demand for khadi and it is good that those who
really believe in it and yet have been lazy about spinning will
now have to take to the wheel.  Conditions for teaching spinning
are therefore favourable.
There is nothing striking about the figures given by Shri
Jerajani.  Those who think that the world is full of crazy people have
every right to say that Bombay has its full quota of such folk.  Men of
faith believe that the world is the better for them.  The man who strives
for the impossible may be looked upon as a burden.  But the crazy
man who is possessed by some special idea is the crazy man who is
prized by society.  I place Shri Viththaldas in this category.  To find
even a few people in a pleasure-loving city like Bombay who realize
the power of khadi is no small matter for satisfaction.  Khadi will grow
to its full height of course only when it is manufactured in every
village and in every home and used there.
Just as Bombay is the foremost city where giving money in
charity is concerned, so it can play a leading part in the difficult task
of producing khadi.  Who would not like Bombay to hold this coveted
position?  Shri Viththaldas and his colleagues are working hard for
this goal.  If they die in the attempt to bring their dreams to fruition
their death will be worth while.  They must, however, hasten slowly in
order to avoid mistakes.  They must, however, hasten slowly in order
to avoid mistakes.  If they are watchful and mend their errors at once
all will surely be well with their work.

472.  INTERVIEW  TO  U.  P.  I.
SIMLA,
May 9, 1946
As Mahatma Gandhi returned to his camp . . . after his 11
2  hours’ interview
with Sir Stafford Cripps, the United Press of India representative accosted him and
asked for news relating to the latest development in the political situation.  Gandhiji
smilingly pointed to the weather outside and said :
Don’t you see there is no more rain?  The sky is clear of clouds
and the storm which was raging has stopped.

473.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING
SIMLA,
May 10, 19461
Mahatma Gandhi congratulated the audience again on the perfect quiet they had
maintained during the prayer hour.  He hoped that they would be as disciplined
wherever they went, whether for prayer or for any other gathering.  If after leaving
here they became disorderly, noisy, and quarrelled with each other, then their quiet, he
said, was but a mockery.2
He told them that the spirit of prayer must abide with them all the twenty-four
hours, if it was a heart prayer and came not merely from the lips.  The real peace of
prayer could come to their hearts only if God entered therein.  Then they would be the

enmity against anyone, they would be truthful, they would cheat no one if they were
in business.1
Relating an incident of his youthful days, Mahatma Gandhi said how as a
young man he had once gone into a small shop in Bombay and asked for a pen-knife.
He was shown one priced at Re. 1-8.  He thought Re. 1-8 was too much and bought the
article at half that price.  But on testing it, he found that it was not worth even a pice.
He could not even sharpen his pencil with it.
If people are dishonest and chear others in this or in any other
way, they do not understand the meaning of prayer.
Gandhiji said he would like more and more persons to come to the prayer
gatherings but only if they came in the right spirit and with listening ears, so that
they may live up to weather good they might take from the worship.
It may take time for recitation to come from the heart even as a
seed sown has to be nurtured and bears fruit only in due season.  If
the desire to have God within us is there, progress, however slow, is
bound to be. Man cannot be transformed from bad to good overn-
ight.  God does not exercise magic.  He too is within His own law.  His
law, however, is different from the law of the State.  There may be
mistakes in the latter but God cannot err.  If He were to go beyond the
limits of His law, the world would be lost.  He is changeless,
unchanging, unequalled, the same yesterday, today and for ever.  His
law is written on the tablets of our hearts.
They could become changed men and women, only if they had the desire of
reform and if they were prepared for ceaseless endeavour.

DEAR  FRIEND ,
I thank you for your letter of the 10th instant about salt.2
This is a fine instance of how the irresponsible mind works.
You were good enough to tell me last Monday3 when I was silent that
the British did not care for credit.  When my silence was broken, the
Cabinet Mission had come and we plunged into high politics.  The

Wavell  and Cabinet Mission”, 6-5-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 381corollary to your dictum seems to be that the British would not mind
the discredit of any action.
In my opinion the notice1 you have been good enough to        
send me is a discreditable affair. The only straight answer from          
my mind which thinks ever of the masses and is responsible and re-
sponsive to them would be to abolish the hateful monopoly and tax
especially in these days of famine.  But according to you this simple
act of justice must be left to be done by your successor, the
independent Government of India, whenever it comes into being.2

SIMLA,
May 11, 1946
DEAR  MR. HAMPT,
I have your long letter. It is difficult to give precise advice
through communications. All I can say is that you should have a
judicious fast under some medical observance, living when you feel
really hungry on glucose-water with an ounce of juice of fresh limes,
as often as your system requires it. Dates are contra-indicated. If you
are able to take sufficient glucose you will sustain your strength and
go through your work. Nothing else should be taken. The fast can be
continued for a fortnight or longer under medical advice.
Yours sincerely,
M. K. G ANDHI

CHI.  MANUDI ,
I have your letter after many days.  Were you busy or just lazy?
You are again blaming me for your own lack of confidence.  If
you have grown wise and never cry, if you don’t care for what others
say, who could stop you from coming here alone?  Have you not
yourself put the condition, “Who will teach me, and what?”  If you
have confidence in yourself, why need you ask that question?  I do
wish, of course, that Jaisukhlal1 should be with you.  I understand your
explanation.  It is sad that Jaisukhlal should take this view.  Why
should a person dedicated to public service care for sweet or bitter
experiences?  It is enough if one’s heart is clean.
You may now do what seems best to you.  I got J.’s letter about
rationing.  I am thinking of forwarding it to Bhavangar.
First send your annual report and then talk about a message.
I am glad that both of you keep good health.

You may have milk, but must avoid pulses.  If you do this, you are

As regards Kanchan, I do believe her complaint to be justified.

all servants but you will not be able to achieve it.  After all we cannot
carry on like this.  The life of an ascetic is not for us.  We try to
approximate to it.  Yes, it was a lapse on your part that you did not
carry the key with you.  To keep a cash-box and not to carry the key
with you is as good as not keeping a cash-box.  Hasn’t Bhartrihari
written that the rich live in fear of being robbed?  I do not like your
idea of undertaking a fast.  It is another thing if we undertake one for
our own lapse.  But a lapse can be counteracted not by undertaking a
fast but by not repeating the lapse.  Secondly, the one who undertakes
a fast in order to purify another who has committed a theft ought to
be absolutely pure.  There was no doubt negligence at the root of this
incident.  Find out what Kishorelal thinks about this.

484.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING
SIMLA,
May 11, 1946
Interpreting the bhajan sung by Sucheta Kripalani Gandhiji said :
It is good to sing devotional songs in tune.  But if we come to
the prayers with the attraction of listening to good music alone we
may overlook the meaning underlying the prayer.  The best bhajan is
one that is sung from the heart even if the style of singing is notVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 387perfect.
Today’s bhajan tells us that we are all citizens of the land in    
which there is neither sorrow nor suffering.  You should not imag-      
ine that the reference is to heaven. The poet himself says that             
he is singing of the land in which we are living.  This does not mean
we have to wait for attaining perfection.  Every one of us can create
such a land within oneself if only one enthrones the God within.  The
world is after all made up of individuals. True, there are people of
different races and colours, speaking different languages.  How to live
in such a world is exactly what the bhajan tells us.  I do not know the
composer1 of this bhajan but I would advise those who have been
truly moved by it to make a copy of the bhajan not for singing but to
translate its ideas into practice in their own lives.
Those who come to attend prayers ought to carry something
with them from here.  Yesterday I was hurt to hear the noise created
after prayers.  It only means that my advice goes unheard.  Such noise
leads to scuffles and riots.  Afterwards I felt that either I should stop
speaking after prayers or the prayers should be conducted silently.
Silent prayer is the best prayer.  It is only through peace and
calm that we can establish communion with God.  It was only during
my tours in Assam and Bengal that I started speaking after prayers.
People ought to contribute generously for Harijans.
Gandhiji asked people not to follow him to his residence for it hampered the
task for which he had come there.
What is there to see in places which are all bound to perish.  An
earthquake may raze a palace to the ground whereas a hut may stand
intact.  You should remain calm even if others are restless.  A person
who has the strength of truth and non-violence, need not fear anyone.
Peace and discipline alone can suppress unrest.

I suppose I must count it a favour that you wrote to me after so

About marriage my views are definite.  A girl must be allowed
to study till she attains the age of 20.  She may then be married when    
she feels the desire.  If she wants to marry earlier and has grown         
big enough for her age, we may help her. You many discuss the
matter often with Sita and not marry her till she herself wishes to get
married.  The big mistake parents make is that they do not discuss this
matter with their children. I think they should talk with them as with
friends.  It would be better if she draws no lesson from the experience

Referring to the spate of false rumours which filled the air, viz., that there had
been a breakdown in the talks, that the Cabinet Mission were returning home without
doing anything and Indian leaders would again return empty-handed as they did from
the Simla Conference4 last time, Gandhiji said that this was not a conference like the
one they had last year.  If he understood the English language aright, the Cabinet
Mission was here to find out how best they could implement their decision to quit, i.

4 Held in June-July, 1945; videVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 393e., remove their power from India.  It was their duty, if they could, to try to bring
about agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League.  The Conference was
being held for that purpose.  If people were united, no power on earth could have ruled
over them but the tragedy was that they had their differences.  But even if the
Conference failed in its purpose, no one need be disappointed.  Those who have faith
in God must be patient and brave.  Supposing they were going to be deceived, they
must stand up and face the consequences bravely.  Gandhiji said he had no reason to
believe that the Cabinet Mission was here to deceive them.  They were trying to leave
in an orderly manner so that Indians may be able to live in peace.  There was no need
to worry.  Man had to do his duty.  God had given him strength and discernment to do
so.  But results were always in God’s hands.
Last in their anxiety for their own future they might forget their duty      
towards those whom they had condemned as the lowest of the sweepers’ quarters.      
The report which the latter brought him filled him (Gandhiji) with anger and grief.     
He would have loved to go there himself.  Unfortunately he could not now     
negotiate hills and therefore could not walk so far to see them himself.  He thought          
it a crime to sit in rickshaws especially for an able-bodied man.  He disliked           
even a motor car.  He wanted always to use his legs, the means of locomotion           
that God had given him.  Last night he walked, but the hill seemed unending.               
It was impossible for him, much as he would have liked to do so, to live in the     
Harijan Nivas here.  He had heard of it before and what Badshah Khan told                
him confirmed it, namely, that the quarters in which they were forced to live         
were not fit for animals, much less for human beings.  Some of them had been to see
him in the morning with a long tale of woe.  It was the bounden duty of the residents
of Simla to look into their grievances and have them redressed.
He had heard too that the Khadi Bhandar at Simla might have to be closed
down, because the Simla public were too lazy and too ununderstanding to spin the
requisite quota of yarn.  He told them that he still maintained that swaraj hung on the
thread of hand-spun yarn.  Even if they got political swaraj, as they were going to,
they would never be able to maintain it without khadi which was the truest symbol of
non-violence.  If they hoped to maintain swaraj through force, they were hopelessly
mistaken.  Someone stronger would come and wrest their freedom from them.  It was
in the hands of the public in Simla to keep the Bhandar going and he hoped they
would do so.  Punjabi women were the first to offer him yarn in the old days.  Let them
live up to their reputation.  For himself, he would rather lose their money and close
down every Bhandar, if need be, but swaraj never.
Harijan, 19-5-1946394 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI497.  A  GOOD  REMINDER
An anonymous friend has taken the trouble of collecting
apposite extracts from the Book of Job and Psalms.  As they are a
perpetual reminder to all of us, I gladly give them below.1  The moral
I draw from the sheaf is that since man is only dust and at best grass,
he had better pass the few moments he is on this earth in the service of
his fellow creatures.  I am hoping that the sender has not collected the
Biblical verses to show the futility of all work, which is a doctrine of
laziness and parasitism.

498.  SLIGHTING  SWARAJ?2
Since the decision that khadi could only be purchased by giving a certain
quota of yarn came into being, it has become very hard for a man like myself .
. . to find the requisite time for spinning.  Nevertheless I have been spinning
11
2  hours daily in order to be true to my pledge.  I had no slivers left the other
day and, therefore, went to the khadi Bhandar to buy some.  I was asked by the
Manager either to come to the Bhandar in order to make my own slivers or do
the carding there and make the slivers at home.  Now it is impossible for me
with my very limited living space to slivers at home nor has a man like me the
time to go and make them at the Bhandar.  I said, “Either give me slivers or
else I shall have to give up spinning.”  I was told I was at liberty to do what I
considered proper. . . .
The above letter3 requires an answer.  The plight of the writer is
the same as that of the many who live in the slums of Bombay.  If our
people were not so easily satisfied, the landlords of Bombay would not
relegate poor families to one small living room each.  Lakhs live in
this way and thus make it possible for the rich to have their Malabar
Hill and Chowpatty.
The spinning-wheel shows us the way to remedy these
conditions.  If this were not so, it would have no place in my life.  A
few people may carve out their way by the sword, but the crores
cannot.  We must not imagine that slums do not exist in London, or

Durgashankar”, 12-5-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 395Paris, or even New York.  They do.
What will be the condition in Russia it is too early yet to say.
What then about the writer’s difficulty?  He says he finds time to
spin 11
2  hours daily.  A man who spins that much every day can
accumulate more yarn than necessary for his khadi needs.  It was a
mistake on his part to want to buy slivers from the Bhandar.  The
Manager gave him the correct reply.  Where there is room for
spinning there is also room for ‘tunai’ (new carding method) or
‘punai’ (simpler than ‘ tunai’).  If there is no room for the wheel
there is always the takli.  The Dhanush takli  too takes up less space.
Whatever difficulties apply to the individual apply to all.  The way to
swaraj lies in not going under but in overcoming them.  Necessity is
the mother of invention.
Again, why should not the facilities for carding, slivering and
spinning offered by the Khadi Bhandar be utilized?  The new method
of making slivers does not require much space and is not difficult.
The main requisite is for the spinner to have the faith that swaraj
hangs on a thread of hand-spun yarn.  It will not hurt the country’s
cause if the man who lacks this faith gives up spinning.  Khadi does
enable many poor persons to earn their living by spinning and
weaving.  But this cannot do the work for the crores.

499.  VALMIKIS  OF  SIMLA1
Readers must know that Valmiki is another word for Bhangi.
Their living quarters in Simla are deplorable.  No one bothers about
them.  Rajkumari2 has tried her best for them for years but how much
can a single person do?  I am unable to get as far and see things for
myself, but I requested Badshah Khan who is staying with me to go
there.  He gives me a piteous account of their hovels.  Some of the
Valmikis have been to see me and have placed other woeful
complaints before me.  I feel that if in the first instance their living
quarters were rebuilt many of their other complaints too would be put
right.  It is the bounden duty of the public and the Municipality of
Simla to remove this evil as soon as they can from their midst.  They

SIMLA,
May 13, 1946
Monday is the last day of my prayer gatherings in Simla
because I will be leaving for Delhi tomorrow.  Yesterday I had told
you that even if the Congress and the Muslim League failed to come
to an agreement, it would not necessarily mean that all was over.  After
all, Hindus and Muslims are brothers.  Some day they are certainly
going to unite.,The British Cabinet Mission has declared their
intention to withdraw British rule from India.  It is my firm conviction
that it should and will be withdrawn. There is no cause at all for us to
despair.  Freedom is our life’s breath and no other power can exercise
that freedom on our behalf.  We must, therefore, prepare ourselves for
freedom.  How we should do so, I have been telling you in the course
of the talks here.  So far we have been fighting for freedom with God
as sustenance and support.  Only with His help can we attain our
freedom and preserve it.4

514.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING1
NEW  DELHI,
[May 15, 1946 ]2
Echoing Badshah Khan’s word at the end of the prayers, Gandhiji said it was a
travesty of true religion to consider one’s own religion as superior and others’ as
inferior.  All religions enjoined worship of the one God who was all-prevasive.  He
was present even in  a drople of water or  in a tiny  speak of dust.
Even those who worship idols, worship not the stone  of which it
is made;  they try  to  see God who resides in it.
Similarly it  was a libel  to call the Paris fire-worshippers or sun-worshippers.
1 Reproduced from Pyarelal’s “Weekly Letter”
2 From the reference to the Cabinet Delegation’s announcement being made
within “twenty-six hours’.  The announcement was made on May 16, 1946.VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 403The Parsi hymn which Dr.  Dinshaw Mehta had recited  corresponded to the Gayatri1 of
the Hindus.  It was nothing but puree worship of God.  The various religion were like
the leaves on a tree.  No two leaves  were alike, yet there was no antagonis between
the branches on which they  grew.  Even so, there is an underlying unity in the varity
which  we see in  God’s  creation.
Speculation as to the contents of the impending  announcement of the Cabinet
Mission had reached a feverish height with the return from  Simla of the Mission and
other members of the Tripartite Conference.  Friends had been asking, remarked
Gandhiji, as  to what the message was likely to contain.  He  did not know, nor  did he
speculate.  It was no use giving thought as to what it would contain.  A man of prayer
could not do otherwise.  Good or bad,  they would know all in another twenty-six
hours.  It would then be open to them to accept or reject it.  Instead of looking
outwards let them inward and ask God  what their duty was in either event.  For him
and them in the meanwhile, it should be enough  to know that Cabinet Delegation had
come all the way leaving their hearth  and home to  find out in what manner British
rule was to end and when the last British soldier was to leave India,  and not  whether
or not to  leave India.  It was  necessary for them to find out whether the Congress    
and the Muslim League could be brought together.  British rule had separate          
them and if they (the Cabinet Mission) failed it was small wonder.  They were bound
to come together soon after the British hold on India had demonstrably ceased.  The
Cabinet Delegation’s concern was to quite India without a moment’s delay.
But supposing the reverse happens they  will be the losers, not
we.  We have chosen the path  of  self-suffering.  We  rise through our
suffering.  That is nature’s law.  He who clings to his sordid self or
family interests loses.  Man is sent into the world to perform his duty
even at the cost of his life if necessary.  We must therefore be braced
for any suffering that may come in the performance of duty.
All of us, Hindus and Mussalmans, constitute  an integral whole.
If  someone errs  all must suffer for it.  God has so ordered this world
that no one can keep his goodness or badness exclusively to himself.
The whole world is  like the  human body with  its various members.
Pain in one member is  felt in the whole body.  Rot in one part must
inevitably poison the whole system.  Let us, therefore, cease to think in
terms of individual and think in terms of the whole country.  We must
put faith in God and be careful for nothing.   We hold our destiny in
our own hands and no one but ourselves can make or mar it.

document itself carefully and then form their own opinion.  He deprecated the habit of
borrowing opinions from newspapers.
Newspapers should be for the study of facts.  They  should not
be allowed  to kill the habit of independent thinking.
The English language, he warned them, was a difficult medium to master.  Even
he, after his residence for nearly twenty years among English-speaking people, could
not claim to have full mastery over it.  They should therefore study the document in
Hindustani to be able to grasp its full meaning.
Whether you like the Cabinet Delegation’s announcement or
not, it is going to be the most momentous  one in the history of India
and therefore requires careful study.1
As men of prayer it further behoved them to put themselves entirely in the
hands of God and pray to Him to illumine and purify them so as to fit them for
understanding the document aright.

May 17, 19462
Taking as his text the song3 sung by Shrimati Sucheta  Kripalani about “the
land that was without sorrow and suffering,” Gandhiji proceeded to examine the
Cabinet Mission’s pronouncement in the light of the ideal set forth in that song.
How far was Cabinet Mission’s pronouncement calculated to enable them to realize
that ideal?
The poet says we are citizens of a country in which there is
neither sorrow nor suffering.  Where is such a country to be found in
this world?  I confess, throughout my wandering I have not come
across such a country so far. The poet has latter described the
condition for the attainment of that ideal state.  It is easy to observe
them individually.  For one who really and truly is pure at heart, there
is no sorrow or suffering.  but it is  a difficult state for the millions to
attain.  Nevertheless we want India to be such a country.
He had asked them on the previous day to examine independently of              
other people’s opinions the statement of the Cabinet Delegation when they               
saw it. They should examine it from the point of view of a country which would be
without sorrow or suffering.  He would give them his own reactions.  He, however, did
not want to contradict himself by asking them to follow his ideas if they did not
appeal to them.  Everyone should think  for himself and herself.  They were to weigh
opinions and adopt only those they had assimilated.
He had glanced at the document casually on the previous night as soon as it
was received. He had read it carefully in the morning.  It was not an award.  The
Mission and  the Viceroy had tried to bring the parties together but they could not
bring about an agreement.  So they had recommended to the country what in their
opinion was worthy of acceptance by the Constituent Assembly.  It was open to that
body to vary it, reject it or improve upon it.  There was no ‘take it or’ business about
their recommendations. If there were restrictions, the Constituent Assemby would not
be a sovereign body, free to frame a constitution of independence for India.  Thus the
Mission has  suggested for the Centre certain subjecs. It was open to the Assembly by
the majority vote of Muslims and non-Muslims separately, to  add to  them or even
reduce them. And it was open to the Assembly to abolish the distiction which the
Mission had felt forced to recognize.  Similarly about grouping.  The provinces were
free to reject the very idea of grouping.  No province  could be forced against its will

3 Vide “The Hymn”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 409to belong to a group, even if the idea of grouping was accepted.  He instanced only
two things to  illustrate this point.  He had not exhausted the list of things which
seemed to him to be open to objection or improvement.
Subject to the above interpretation, which he held was right, he told them that
the Mission had brought forth something of which they had every reason  to be
proud.
There were some, he proceeded, who said the English  were  incapable of doing
the right thing.  He did not  agree with them.  The Mission and the Viceroy were
godfearing as they themselves claimed to be.  It was beneath their dignity as men to
doubt a person before he was proved to be untrue to his work.
The late Charlie Andrews was very inch of him  an Englishman
who had died slaving for India.  It would be grievously wrong to
doubt in advance every one of his contrymen.
Whatever the wrong done to India by the British rule, if the statement of the
Mission was geniune, as he believed it was, it was in discharge of an obligation
which they had declared the British owed to  India, namely, to get off India’s back.  It
contained the seed to  convert this land of sorrow into  one without sorrow and
suffering.

1 U Ba  Pe, member, Burmese Legislative Council, told Gandhiji  that at the
time of the separation of Burma, the Burmese people were made to understand by  the
Britishf that Burma would get the same measure of freedom as India would, and the
Burma would get it at the same time.  He sough Gandhiji’s help in    Burma’s struggle.410 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI524.  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER   MEETING1
NEW DELHI,
May 18, 1946
Pursuing the theme of the previous day’s song2 ,  Gandhiji asked. . . how they
were to convert India, which was today the home of sorrow and suffering into the ideal
country about which the poet had sung.  The reply he said was furnished by the song
about the sermon of the trees which had just been sung.
In tha song one is asked to take the lesson from the trees which
themselves suffer the fierce rays of the sun and give shade to those
who take shelter under them. To those who throw stones at them, they
respond by dropping fruit. That is true philanthropy.  To learn         
that philanthropy we are asked in that song to go to Harijan.  Today
society has condemned Harijans to a life of fifth and degradation.
That    is not their shame but our shame.  Society has treated them as
untouchables and condemned them to live in  ghettos and yet they
continue to render invaluable service to society for a mere pittance.  It
was open to them to take more lucrative avocations as some of them
have done.  The fact that vast majority of them have chosen not  to,
resounds to their credit.
If they could show that spirit of service in spite of their ignorance and
backwardness, he asked, how much more spirit of selfless service and sacrifice ought
the so-called savarna classes to show?
He had remarked in his previous day’s address that he saw the germs of the
realization of the ideal envisaged by the poet in the  song that had been sung on that
day, in the announcement of the Cabinet Mission.  But it was subject to the condition
that it meant what it said.  He likened that announcement to a promissory note, whose
worth depended entirely on its genuineness and validity.
If the promise inscribed on a promissory note is not honoured,
the note is worth nothing and fit only to be  torn to pieces and thrown
away.
Truth meant everything to him.  He had said that he would not purchase even
swaraj at the cost of truth,  because swaraj so purchased would be illusory.  It was his
hope and prayer, in which he invited the audience to  join him, that the announcement
of the Cabinet Mission would be finally hounoured in letter and in spirit, and that God

had done for His devotees in days of old.

CHI.  MANILAL,
I have been meaning to write to you for many days, but could
not.  Today I have decided to dectate a letter.  I am dictating this while
having warm water and honey.  I had a long discussion with Sorabjee.
He broke down and cried. He says he can never have, has never had
and will never have any share in doing you harm.  He looks upon you  
as a blood-brother. He will, or course, see you. Do what you think
best. He wishes that Omar Sheth’s son should be taken on the  Trust.1
If you agree, I have no objection at all.  He is of the view  that it will
not look well if there is no Muslim on the Trust.  His view does appeal
to me.  Show him the names  which we had considered. I have an
impression that you had suggested Medh’s2 name and that I had
accepted it after some hesitation. Sorabjee says that it will produce a
very good impression if his name is not included. He says that
Medh’s having the spirit of service in him does not mean that he is
qualified to be a trustee. Think calmly over this suggestion. Sorab
must have left by now.  The pressure of work is daily increasing here.
The heat  is sometimes bearable and sometimes unbearable.  The same
is the condition of the mind.
I  hope Sushila is in good health.  Sita, Arun and IIa must be
fine.  Sita’s [examination] result must be out.  I am sure it is  good.

532.  SPEECH AT  PRAYER  MEETING1
NEW DELHI,
May 19, 1946
Gandhiji said that if they had carefully followed and assimilated Badshah
Khan’s remarks2 they would know that the object of prayer was not to please God,
who does not want our prayers or praise, but to purify ourselves.
God is omnipresent. There is not an atom in the universe
without His presence.  The process of self-purificattion consists in a
conscious realization of His presence within us.  There is no strength
greater than that which such realization gives.
It had pleased him to see so  many of them coming to attend the prayers, he
said.  But it would hurt him if he found that  they had come just for fun, or, what would
be worse   still,  to hear his politicaal views.  As a rule politics should not be
permitted to intrude upon prayer.  He, however, could not avoid referring to current
political topics sometimes in the course of his after-prayer discourses because life
could not be divided into water-tight compartments.  Presence of God had to be  felt in
every  walk of life.  If they thought that as soon as they left the prayer ground they
could live and behave anyhow, their attendance at the prayers was useless.  If that
interest in the prayers was genuine, the next day’s prayers, he hoped, would be as
numerously attended as on the day he spoke, although he would not be speaking on
account of his Monday silence.

MY  DEAR  BAPU ,
What you said about me publicly has, like the churning of the ocean,             
brought up all the poison, and you have to swallow it like Rudra!  I know                      
you can.  But it has made my old longing for peace too strong to resist.  I             
haven’t the strength to stand it any longer.  I bore much all these days.  I struggled
hard to work without minding the calumniators but I give it up now.  I have often
asked myself the question : ‘Is it worth while?’  I feel it is not.  I must yield to the
longing of my heart not to be misunderstood.  Why should I be thought to be seeking
‘power’ when it is not the case at all?  I must prove it, although the proof is one that
leaves no good behind but the mere proof.
Now that the urgent job of selections for the legislature is all over, let me
leave the scene.
For my place (the University seat) there is Sambamurti available.  He has not
been given any seat nor did he apply.  The position he has occupied in Andhra’s
public life for over a quarter of a century, the unrivalled manner in which he fulfilled
his duties as Speaker and his drive and energy are well-known, and it would be wrong
to leave him out.  He can easily take my place in the nomination for the University.
I beg of you to approve of my action and pass it on at once to Sardar so that he
may do the needful.  Nominations must be officially filed before 1st March.
Love.

VALLABHBHAI  PATEL’S  MESSAGE  TO  FOREIGN  PRESS1
BOMBAY,
March 4, 1946
Being a witness to the recent happenings in Bombay, I can say, nothing like
it has happened within this generation.  The destruction of property was wantonly
thoughtless.  There is no doubt that what happened was a direct outcome of the
lessons of the war that has only officially closed, and an echo of what is happening
in the West.
The inequality which still seems to reign supreme and which it was hoped
would die out, was galling for the Indian Ratings and resentment of distincion
between Europeans and Indians made them impatient to the point of hurling what was
bound to be a futile defiance on the part of an ill-armed few against overwhelming
odds fully armed.
The populace, whose sympathy has always been with the fighters against
imperialism, readily joined hands and brushed aside the wise counsels of leaders who
love liberty no less than they.
It was not without the greatest difficulty that I persuaded the Ratings to
surrender unconditionally, giving them at the same time the assurance that whatever
was just in their cause would be championed by the Congress, that so far as was
humanly possible, full justice would be done and that there would be no
victimization.   I am only hoping that the authorities will not hark back to old, worn-
out methods and senselessly insist on false prestige.
Those who seek to uphold imperialism and perpetuate inequalities can ill
afford to talk of prestige, much less of vindicating it in the present awakening and
consequent determined opposition of which the recent events were convincing
evidence.
As a confirmed believer in the method of truth and non-violence adopted by
the Congress for the past quarter of a century, I deplored the destruction of property,
incendiarism, stopping of locomotives and insult and injury to whitemen, but they
must not be used so as to postpone the declaration of independence even by a day.
The national Congress will, of course, insist on the observance of truth and
non-violent ways by the people but insistence on these ways will lie in the mouths of
those who have constantly denied both or either in their dealings especially with
exploited peoples such as those of India.
We have been looking forward to the coming of the official Deputation and
1Vide “Message to Foreign Press”, 5-3-1946418 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIonly hope that it is coming with the determined purpose of withdrawing British rule
from all India and laying the foundations for a lasting friendship between Great
Britain and India while there is yet a moment left.  Let not history record that it was
too late.

SOUTH  AFRICAN  INDIAN  DEPUTATION’S  MEMORANDUM
TO  THE  VICEROY1
NEW  DELHI,
March 12, 1946
MAY  IT  PLEASE  YOUR  EXCELLENCY ,
We, the undersigned, Sorabjee Rustomjee, Sooba Rama Naidoo, Azum-       
shah Ahmed Mirza and Ahmed Sadek m.  kajee, delegates of the South                            
African Indian Congress, duly appointed at its seventeenth session of the Conference
held in Cape Town from the 8th to 13th February, 1946, together with members co-
opted, being South African Indians at present in India, under authority of the
resolution of the Conference, respectfully beg to submit to you this statement on the
proposed legislation, as announced by Field Marshal Smuts, in Union Parliament on
21st January, 1946, when he made known the intention of the Union Government to
introduce legislation this session adversely affecting Indians in Natal and the
Transvaal.
2.We are deeply grateful to Your Excellency for receiving us at short notice
in spite of your multifarious pre-occupations.
3.The present intention of the Government of the Union of South Africa
will, if carried out, degrade us to a status of inferiority against which we have put up a
fight more definitely since 1893, the year in which an attempt was made to
disfranchise the Indian community as such in Natal.  We then looked upon it as a slur
not only on the Indians in Natal but also on the Mother Country.  Then there was no
Union of South Africa.  The Cape had practically no Indian question worth the name.
Orange Free State had banished the few Indian traders it had, and prided itself on its
thorough anti-Asiatic policy.  The Transvaal had a sprinkling of Indian traders,
hawkers and others.  The “location” system, later known as segregation, had its rise
there.  The whites in Natal had deliberately, and for their own sake, invited the large
number of indentured Indians for their sugar and tea plantations and other industries.
In their wake followed the traders and others, and the Indian population today is
therefore a composite one.
4.One would have thought that the advent of Union would mean the union of
1Vide “Draft Memorandum to Viceroy”, 8-3-1946 and “Statement to the Press”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 419all the races of South Africa, i. e., the African (the Bantu), the European and the
Asiatics (primarily and principally Indians).  What a noble tradition such a union
would have been for the world!  But it was not to be.  On the contrary, the Union
became an anti-African and anti-Asiatic combine.  Every year of the progress of the
Union has definitely marked the progress of this combine, and the strenuous
opposition to it by the Indian settlers and their descendants, as will be clearly seen
by reference to the Appendix A hereto attached.
5.We ask Your Excellency to approach the question from that standpoint
and no other.  The threatened legislation adumbrated by Field Marshal Smuts, which
has hastily brought the delegation from South Africa, is a very large step, perhaps the
largest yet made, in the process of consigning the Asiatics to permanent inferiority.
The wedge has now extended into all-round inequality and inferiority.  Thus there are
zones of segregation, one of which the whites are reserving for themselves in order to
force by legal compulsion the segregation of the other races.  God has made man “one
great human family”.  The white races of South Africa would make of it three separate
parts based on colour.
6.Bad enough as the threatened land legislation is, the prospective
franchise legislation is worse.  It is a mockery of franchise and a poignant reminder
of the low status to be accorded to us—so low that we are not to be deemed even fit
enough to choose one of our own as our representative.
7.We have come all the way from South Africa not to seek protection of
individual or property rights, dear as both are, but we have come definitely to ask
Your Excellency and the people of the Mother Country to appreciate the fight for
equality of status, which is theirs as much as ours, and to give us as much help as
possible for you and them to give.  What is attempted to be done in South Africa is a
denial of the brave declarations made by the British and even the Field Marshal
himself.
8.It has given us much pleasure to learn that the withdrawal of the British
power in India in favour of elected Indian representatives is imminent.  Then may we
ask whether it is not Your Excellency’s double and special duty to enunciate your
stand in favour of equality and, so far as possible, enforce it in no uncertain terms?
9.The announcement of the intention of the Union Government to introduce
legislation so alarmed the Indian community that the South African Indian Congress
at its Conference aforesaid resolved to send a deputation to Field Marshal Smuts.  This
deputation made representations to him not to proceed with the intended legislation,
and to convene a Round Table Conference of the Union Government and the
Government of India in fulfilment of the recommendation of the Natal Indian Judicial
Commission made in March 1945.  This request was refused by him, whereupon the
Conference, after deliberating at great length, adopted the following resolution :420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHICAPE  TOWN,
February 12, 1946
This Conference of the South African Indian Congress, after having heard
the report of the deputation that waited on the Prime Minister, expresses its
grievous disappointment at his refusal to abandon the proposed legislation
and to convene a Round Table Conference between India and South Africa.
This conference interprets this refusal as the very negation of the
principle of solving human problems by negotiations and mutual discussions
and as indicating a legislative design of repressing the community and
settling its fate at the altar of political expediency and sacrificing it to
appease extreme white-reactionaries in this country.  The legislation dealing
with land tenure and communal representation to be introduced by the Prime
Minister, which is totally unacceptable, is an insult to the national honour
and dignity of the Indian nation.
This Conference of the South African Indian Congress, having            
regard to the Prime Minister’s refusal, resolves to mobilize all the         
resources of the Indian people in this country in order to take every measure
possible to secure the lapsing of the Pegging Act and to oppose the proposed
legislation of the Government by :
1.Sending a deputation to India :
(a)to urge the Government of India for convening of a Round Table
Conference between the Governments of India and South Africa;
(b)failing which to request the Government of India (i) to withdraw the
office of its High Commissioner in South Africa, (ii) to apply economic
sanctions against South Africa;
(c)to carry out a campaign of propaganda in India to secure the fullest
support of India’s millions;
(d)to invite Indian leaders to come to South Africa.
2.Sending deputations to America, Britain and other parts of the world.
3.Proceeding immediately to prepare the Indian people of South Africa
for a concerted and prolonged resistance, the details of which this Conference
instructs its Executive to prepare for submission and action to its constituent
bodies.
10.We would, therefore, ask Your Excellency to use your influence to secure
the holding of a Round Table Conference between the two Governments to settle, in
the words of the Natal Indian Judicial Commission, “all matters affecting Indians in
South Africa”.  But should your efforts in this connection unhappily fail, then we ask,
in terms of our resolution herein before embodied, to withdraw the office of the HighVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 421Commissioner for India in the Union of South Africa and to enforce economic and
political sanctions.  We are not unaware that they may mean very little material loss
to South Africa.  We know that counter-measures will cause us hardship.  But our loss
we would count as nothing compared to the moral value of the enforcement of the
sanctions.
We have the honour to be,
Your Excellency’s obedient servants,

LETTER  FROM  SECURITY  PRISONERS1
DUM  DUM  CENTRAL  JAIL,
January 17, 1946
MAHATMAJI ,
We offer you our allegiance—to you personally for your ideal and methods and
to you as the leader of the nation. . . . We had liquidated the Jugantur Party and joined
the Congress without any party reservation. . . .
We started working honestly and sincerely; and our doubts and differences
melted away particularly in view of the ever-developing policy of the Congress
during the War.  But we were arrested in May 1941. . . . Just after our arrest we had
some correspondence with you.  You then wrote : “I have no difficulty in accepting
your limitations of non-violence.  If worked honestly, it will automatically  
expand.”  Now we can say, we have no difficulty in accepting your non-violence—not
only as the best means for achieving Indian revolution but also for saving the
common man of the world as against the rising world Fascism based on naked
violence. . . .
We have been working in and with the Congress since 1921—of course
retaining a second love sometimes dormant and sometimes dominant.  In 1938 we
outgrew that and made the Congress our only vehicle for serving the cause of Indian
independence.  Now we believe your method and programme is the only right way to
be followed. . . .
1Vide “Letter to Sir Frederick Burrows”, 10-3-1946. Only extracts are
reproduced here.422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIWe hope, the moment of the psychological break-away from the past world
not be allowed to slip away and, under your inspiration and insistence, every effort
would be directed to organizing the masses on the basis of your 18-point programme.
After our release we shall be working with the outlook stated above.  We shall
try to stay with you for some time before we start work here.  In our future work we
shall seek your guidance and help. . . .
Before concluding we must say a few words regarding our detention.               
The Government plea of terrorism is wholly false.  Even before our arrest,                 
Sir Nazimuddin, then Home Minister, personally told us his police reports                 
had confirmed his personal information that we were doing nothing but             
Congress work.  This was barely two months before our arrest.  In 1943,                     
as Premier, he made almost the same statement in the Assembly.  This bogey                
of terrorism is simply a police trick—to serve a double purpose—to misrepresent us
to the public and thus to create difficulties for work, and secondly to keep a broad hint
that terrorist groups are still active so that guileless and sincere young men may be
duped, and an atmosphere of terrorism kept up to serve imperialist purposes as
against the Congress programme. . .   There has been no case of terrorism in Bengal
since 1934, and it is simply insulting our intelligence as well as our patriotism to say
that we are thinking—or for that matter any other political group is thinking— of
terrorism at this hour of the day.

CLEMENT  ATTLEE’S  SPEECH1
March 15, 1946
I find from our friends in this House who had been out to India and returned,
from letters received from Indians and from Englishmen in India of all points of view,
complete agreement on the fact that India is today in a state of great tension and that
this is indeed a critical moment.  At the present moment the idea of nationalism is
running very fast in India past to the present position.  The temperature of 1946 is
not the temperature of 1920, 1930 or even 1942.  The slogans of earlier days are
discarded.  Sometimes words that seemed at that time to Indians to express the height
1Vide “Interview to United Press of India”, 16-3-1946 and “Interview to H. N.
Brailsford”, 17-3-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 423of their aspirations are set on one side and other words and ideas thrust forward.
I would like today, therefore, not to stress so much the differences between the
Indians, but let us all realize that . . .  there is this underlying demand among all the
Indian people . . . .  It is worth remembering . . . a nation of 40,00,000 people that
twice sent her sons to die for freedom . . . should herself have freedom to decide her
own destiny (cheers).
My colleagues are going to India with the intention of using their utmost
endeavours to help her to attain that freedom as speedily and fully as possible.  What
form of government is to replace the present regime is for India to decide, but our
desire is to help her to set up forthwith a machinery for making that decision.
There you have met with the initial difficulty of getting that machinery set up
but we are resolved that a machinery shall be set up, and we seek the utmost co-
operation of all Indian leaders to do so.
India herself must choose as to what will  be her future situation and her
position in the world.  Unity may come through the United Nations or through the
Commonwealth but no great nation can stand alone by herself without sharing what
is happening in the world.  I hope that India may elect to remain within the British
Commonwealth.  I am certain that she will find great advantage in doing so, but if she
does, she must do it of her own free will, for the British Commonwealth and Empire is
not bound together by chains of external compulsion.  It is a free association of free
people.
If, on the other hand, she elects for independence—and, in our view, she has a
right to do so—it will be for us to help to make the transition as smooth and easy as
possible. . . .
We want to set up an Interim Government—one of the purposes of the Bill
which has been discussed today—to give the Viceroy greater freedom in order that in
the period which is to elapse while a Constitution is being worked out, you may have
a government enjoying the greatest possible support in India.  I would not like to
fetter the Viceroy’s decision in any way in regard to the choice of portfolios. . . .
I am hoping that statesmen of Britain and of princely India will be able to
work out a solution of the problem of bringing together the various constitutent
parts. . . .  I do not believe for a moment that the Indian princes would lag behind in
the forward march of India. . . .
I am very well aware of the minority problem in India.  I think all Indian
leaders are realizing more and more that need for getting a settlement. . . and I believe
that due provision will be made for them in the Constitution.
With regard to the treaty, we are not going to hand out for anything for our
own advantage which would be to the disavantage of India. . . .424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIn the mass of Asia, an Asia ravaged by war, we have here the one country that
has been seeking to apply the principles of democracy.  I have always felt myself that
political India might be the light of Asia.  It is most unfortunate at the time when we
have to deal with these great political issue . . . we have very grave anxiety over
India’s food supply. . .
Whatever we can do to assist, we shall do.  My colleagues are going out to
India resolved to succeed, and I am sure everyone will wish them Godspeed.

APPENDIX  VII
CONGRESS  WORKING  COMMITTEE  RESOLUTION
ON   SOUTH   AFRICA1
The Working Committee of the Indian National Congress are of opinion that
the disabilities of the Indian settlers in South Africa constitute a blot on humanity
and a slur on the civilization of the West.  As the submission to His Excellency the
Viceroy of the Indian deputation from South Africa shows, the disabilities are an
unbroken tale of progressive prejudice against Asiatics defined as “any Turk and any
member or a race or tribe whose national home is in Asia but which does not include
any member of the Jewish or the Syrian race or a person belonging to the race or class
known as the Cape Malay”, and of broken promises and declarations.  A civilization
that requires for its protection a series of legal enactments imposing political and
economic restrictions on Coloured and Asiatic peoples must contain seeds of future
wars and its own destruction.
The Committee are of opinion that the contemplated breach of trade relations
between India and the Union of South Africa is the mildest step that the Government
of India could have taken.  The Committee would ask the Government of India
forthwith to withdraw their High Commissioner, if the Union Government would not
suspend the proposed legislation, pending the convening of a Round Table
Conference between the two Governments to consider the whole policy of the Union
Government against non-white peoples of the earth.
The Committee are painfully surprised to find Field Marshal Smuts, the
1Vide “Statement to  the Press”426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIPremier of the Union, dismissing, on the untenable plea of regarding the proposed
anti-Asiatic Bill as a domestic affair, the right of the Indian Government and, by
parity of reasoning, of the other Allied Powers of friendly intervention.  The
Committee hold that at this time of the day it is not open to any State, however
powerful it may be, to refuse to listen to the public opinion of the world as voiced
through its different States with reference to any legislation regarded by them as of an
inhuman character or as amounting to a slur on the self-respect of the races
comprising such a State.
The Committee venture to advise the victorious Allies to take notice of the
contemplated action of the Government of South Africa inasmuch as the late war
would have been fought in vain, if now the persistence by the Union Government of
South Africa in the bar sinister against Asiatic races and Coloured people inhabiting
that sub-continent is maintained.
To the Indian Deputation from South Africa the Committee would say that
whilst they (the Committee) and, indeed, the whole of India, irrespective of parties or
communities, are with them in their just struggle and would lend them all the moral
weight they can, they should realize that the brunt of the unequal struggle will have to
be borne by them, and the Committee feel assured that the Indians in South Africa will
worthily carry out the example set by them years ago of vindicating their self-respect
and that of the Motherland by the noble rule of self-suffering.
The Committee would, however, fain hope, even at the eleventh hour, that in
the place of the indefensible law of the jungle, which the policy as revealed by the
contemplated legislation enunciates, the Government of the Union of South Africa
and its white settlers would listen to reason and the appeal of the moral law by which
mankind lives.

APPENDIX VIII
VICEROY’S  NOTE  ON  INTERVIEW  TO  GANDHIJI1
April 3, 1946
I thought the interview with Gandhi, naked except for a dhoti and          
looking remarkably healthy, was rather a deplorable affair.  The Secretary of State
began with his usual sloppy benevolence to this malevolent old politician, who for
all his sanctimonious talks has, I am sure, very little softness in his composition.
He began with the demand for the abolition of the salt tax, which he led up to by a lot
of rather hypocritical sob-stuff.  (In the five yeas I have been in the Government of
India, I have never heard from anyone but Gandhi a suggestion that the salt tax       
was really oppressive, and it brings in nine crores; but Gandhi wants it be removed 
1Vide “Letter to Purshottamdas Thakurdas”, 23-3-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 427 as a sop to his vanity, because he went to prison over it 15 years ago.)1  He rambled
on in his usual rather vague way, approaching the Pakistan issue, by the way                
of his drunken son who had become Muslim for a while in the hope that it would      
cure him of drink; spoke of his efforts to meet Jinnah by Rajagopalachari’s formula,
and his Bombay talks; and finished with the meant-to-be plausible proposal that
Jinnah should be asked to form a Ministry—the catch being that he would be subject
to the Hindu majority in the Central Assembly (I had heard this idea put forward
before).  As usual Gandhi refused to be pinned down to details.  The interview closed
by a little speech of Secretary of State expressing ‘penitence’ for Britain’s misdeeds
in the past !

APPENDIX IX
NOTE  ON  INTERVIEW  TO  CABINET  MISSION2
Secret April 3, 1946, 4 p.m.
The Secretary of State said that what the Delegation would like best would be
to have Mr. Gandhi’s advice as to what he would like to see happen, especially in
regard to the position as regards the Muslim League.  Mr. Gandhi said that he would
rather such a question should be put to the authorized representatives of the Congress.
He had come, in reply to the invitation sent to him, to help and not to hinder and
what he was most anxious about was that there should be the right atmosphere.  He
had asked in writing for certain action which would let the people feel that
independence was coming.
The Cabinet Delegation would have a much greater measure of difficulty to
contend with than any other mission to India.  If they meant business, he would
advise them to take action which would produce a hearty friendship.  This could not be
done without the release of the prisoners now in British custody.  The flowers of the
Indian nation were in prison—whether  they were violent or non-violent did not
matter, but if the Delegation was sincere, it was bound to release them.  Jayaprakash
Narayan was one of India’s most learned men.  For the same reasons, the salt tax
should be removed.  Salt should be free for the poor man.  The humanitarian          
clause introduced by Lord Halifax as a result of Mr. Gandhi’s movement in             
1 In the source, Penderel Moon explains : “The tax on salt, which dated back  
to long before the advent of the British Raj, was so light that no individual   was
conscious of it as a burden.  But its abolition was one of Gandhi’s fads, and   he had
made defiance of the Salt Laws and illegal manufacture of salt—its manufacture was a
Government monopoly and the tax was included in the price at which it     was sold to
the public—the main feature of his Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930.”
2 Vide “ A Note”, 3-4-1946428 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI1930 had worked well in some places.  But whatever the legal difficulties               
were, the tax could be removed, and a message of independence be brought                  
to every village in India.  He was very sorry, he had received a letter from                  
Mr. Abell saying this could not be done.  It had been written, if he might                  
say so, unthinkingly.  Much taxation had been introduced by the Viceroy for war
purposes, and he could as easily remove  this salt tax.
Mr. Gandhi said that he had passed 18 days with Mr. Jinnah.  He claimed to be
a sincere friend of the Muslims, but had never been able to appreciate the Pakistan
which Mr. Jinnah says he means.  Mr. Jinnah had never in concrete terms given a
definition of Pakistan.  His Pakistan was a sin which he (Mr. Gandhi) would not
commit.  The substance of Pakistan as he understood it was independence of culture
and a legitimate ambition.  In Rajagopalachari’s Formula he (Mr. Gandhi) had given
concrete shape to a proposal to meet this demand.  He differed from Rajagopalachari,
but when the latter produced his Formula, he was on his last legs and said that he
accepted it.
If this was what Mr. Jinnah meant, he accepted it and did so in writing.  Mr.
Gandhi’s conception of Pakistan is there in concrete form.  If that were put into shape
and all the snags removed, it was to form the basis for negotiations and, unless he
was reasoned into it, he could not go further because beyond that Pakistan is an
untruth.
The two-nation theory is far more dangerous.  The Muslim population is a
population of converts—only a microscopic minority are not.  They are all
descendants of India-born people.  Jinnah is sincere but his logic is utterly at fault
especially as a kind of mania possesses him.  He himself was called a maniac and he,
therefore, honoured Jinnah for his mania.  In 18 days Mr. Gandhij failed to be
convinced of this two-nation theory.  He asked Jinnah whether his own son who had
gone over to the Muslim religion changed his nationality by doing so.  Mr. Gandhi’s
Formula did not solve the difficulty unless we could get agreement.  But why should
the Delegation worry ?  They must lie on the bed they had prepared and this situation
is a legacy of British rule.  Wrong does not become right to give it another lease of
life.  If you have undone the past, you must write on a clean slate and cannot have two
nations or two Constitution-making Bodies.  The difficulty would not be solved if the
Muslim League refused to join the Constitution-making Body.  After having
exhausted all friendly resources, if you feel a stage must arrive when you feel you must
say that there shall only be one Constitution-making Body, you must take the risks
of that.  There must be a considerable interim period.  What is to happen in the period
and what is to happen to your promise?  Let Mr. Jinnah form the first Government and
choose its personnel from elected representatives in the country.  The Viceroy would
appoint them formally but, in fact, Mr. Jinnah would choose.  If he does not do so,VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 429then the offer to form a Government should be made to Congress.  After all, it is no
light responsibility.    The food situation is most serious, and you will not be able to
deal with this famine without producing a psychological effect on the people.  The
best administrative organization will not help without this.
Mr. Gandhi said, in reply to questions, that there were two formulae of his, one
by Mr. Rajagolapalchari and the other in his correspondence with Mr. Jinnah which
had been published.  The Interim Government must be absolutely national.  Mr.
Jinnah could choose who he liked for his Government.  They would be subject to the
vote of the Assembly from which they were drawn.  He would not mind the Council
beign responsible to Lord Wavell, if there were honest conventions.  The Secretary of
State said that, of course, Mr. Jinnah in existing circumstances had not got a majority
in most of the Legislatures.  If he had to choose Ministers to be responsible to
Provincial Legislatures, most of them would have to be drawn from parties other than
his own.  Mr. Gandhi said, it was inescapable that the Congress had a majority in
most of the Legislatures.  His idea was that the members chosen from the Provincial
Legislatures would be transferred to the Central Legislature, places being made for
them by arranged resignations.  They would then be responsible to the Central
Legislature.  The secretary of State said that, even so, the Legislature would be, of
course, very predominantly Hindu.  If Mr. Jinnah were not prepared to form a
Legislature on this basis, the Congress could be called upon to do so.
Mr. Gandhi said, he did not underrate the difficulties of the situation which the
Delegation had to face.  If he were not an irrepressible optimist, he would despair of
any solution.

VICEROY’S   NOTE  ON  INTERVIEW  TO  GANDHIJI1
Tuesday, April 9, 1946
In the afternoon, Gandhi came to see me about the salt tax.  He professed          
to be coming purely as a friend of Britain, so that the British would get the credit       
of removing this unjust tax before the National Government came into power          
and did so.  The old humbug, I wonder whether he suspects that a National
Government would do nothing of the sort and that the British are easier to bounce.        
I refused, naturally, to commit myself in any way, and merely said, I would look      
into the matter.  (He had sent Amrit Kaur to see Q. and try to influence her in     
helping bounce me.)  He then asked for the release of Jayaprakash Narayan,        
whose wife is apparently one of his followers (‘adopted daughter’, he called her).         
1Vide “Letter to G. E. B. Abell”, 8-4-1946430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII did not commit myself, though I expect we shall have to release him shortly.
Gandhi then started on the I.N..A. and I told him exactly what the I.N.A. were—        
the weaklings and cowards of those captured in Malaya—and what folly it    had been
for Congress to make heroes of such men and to neglect those who had remained true
in spite of starvation, ill-treatment and torture.  When we parted, I gave him a
warning that the threat of mass movement by Congress was a dangerous weapon,
there were still a great many thousand British soldiers in India who did not subscribe
to his doctrine of non-violence, and might be very violent, if British lives or
property suffered.  He took this with a grin, and was very friendly throughout.

APPENDIX XI
LETTER  FROM  G.  RAMACHANDRA  RAO1
I and my co-workers have been trying this method of residing and eating with
the Harijans for the last five or six years.  Our experience proves that it is an efficient
method to remove the social isolation of the untouchables.  But our work is spreading
slowly.  If a man like Bapuji took it up, as he did at Bombay, it is bound to gain wide
publicity and attract more workers to the method.
In this connection, another suggestion might be considered.  Side by side with     
the mixing up, an attempt also might be made to discourage the use of labels of caste     
and creed which raise imaginary barriers between man and man.  Not only should                 
the practice of untouchability go, but the Harijan should not be allowed to              
continue a Harijan; he should be united with the general stream of humanity.          
Similarly the Hindu and Muslim differences might be solved by discarding the           
labels.  Such an attempt will no longer keep the form of communal harmony,                  
but it would lead to the growth of one humanity.  Communal harmony presupposes        
the existence of communities.  In one humanity no communities exist.  Though a
powerful personality like Gandhiji might harmonize communities for a while,             
when the personal influence weakened, the communities would clash again.  So a
permanent solution of communal differences is the growth of one-humanity outlook
rather than communal harmony.
The growth of one-humanity requires the rejection of communal labels.
Perhaps even the rejection of the labels of religion would involve a change of the
belief in god, for every denominational label is associated with faith in a particular
form of god.  But, though every religion talked only of one god, in practice, however,
belief in god always deteriorated into sectarianism and fanaticism because god is a
falsehood.  So atheism is the most suitable attitude for the establishment of one
humanity.
1Vide “Letter to G. Ramchandra Rao”, 9-4-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 431In order to set up happy human relations, communal harmony is the utmost
limit to which the theistic mind can be stretched inasmuch as belief in god has to be
somehow preserved.  But communal harmony is beset with definite drawbacks; so the
desirability of atheism as the best means to establish one humanity and thereby to
lay strong foundations for permanent peace in human relations might be considered.

WOODROW  WYATT’S  NOTE  ON  DISCUSSION  WITH  GANDHIJI1
1.He thinks that the Cabinet Mission has come with the intention of
getting off India’s back.  Their function here is to devise a means of doing it gently.
He agreed that it should also be their function to precipitate a situation in which
Indians must decide the future structure of India themselves.
2.It would be wrong, if the three Cabinet Ministers were to imagine that
they could arrive at a just and fair solution of India’s problems.  They cannot, and it is
not their affair.
3.If the British were to make a decision, and impose it, it would be
overturned as soon as they had gone.
4.Pakistan is a British creation.  (Incidentally, so is the famine.)  He agreed
that it would be much better for Congress to concede Pakistan than for the British.  If
Congress conceded it, it would be something much more glorious.
5.He thinks there may well have to be a blood-bath in India before her
problems are solved.  He would urge non-violence on Congress but does not expect
them to observe it.  The only thing he expects from Congress in the event of civil
war is that they will fight decently and take one tooth for one tooth, and not a hundred
teeth for one tooth as the British do.
6.The Interim Government should be formed on the basis of the Central
Legislature; members of the Central Legislature should nominate the members of the
Executive Council.  Nominated members of the official block must be left out of the
picture.  If the Central Legislature nominated people who were not members of the
Central Legislature, then seats would have to be found for them in the Central
Legislature.
7.He would urge on Congress that they should offer seats on the Executive
Council to the Muslim League.,
8.If the British do not wish to accept the nominations of Congress, then
they should accept the nominations of the Muslim League.  He would then tell
Congress that they must play fair with the Muslim League.
1Vide “Discussion With Woodrow Wyatt”, 13-4-1946432 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI9.He agrees that it might well be unfair for the British to form an Interim
Government and not give it its support.  They should certainly advise it in any case.
10.He thinks it would be reasonable to announce that after a certain date there
will be no British support for the Interim Government so forcing the Interim
Government to solve India’s internal problems before that date.

WINSTON CHURCHILL’S SPEECH1
The world is very ill.  This is the time when hatred is rife in the world and when
many mighty branches of the human family, victors or vanquished, innocent or
guilty, are plunged in bewilderment, distress or ruin.  Two fearful wars in our lifetime
have torn the heart out of its grace and culture.
Measureless injury has been done to much that the 19th century would have
called ‘Christian civilization’, for all the leading nations have been racked by
stresses which have blunted their sensibilities and have destroyed their agreeable
modes of social intercourse.
Only science has rolled forward, whipped by the fierce winds of mortal war,
and science has placed in the hands of men agencies of destruction far beyond any
development of their commonsense or virtue.
In a world where over-production of food was formerly from time to time a
problem, famine has laid its gaunt fingers upon the peoples of many lands and
scarcity upon all.
The psychic energies of mankind have been exhausted by the tribulations
through which they have passed and are still passing.  It is not only bloodletting that
has weakened and whitened us.
The vital springs of human inspiration are, for the moment, drained.  There
must be a period of recovery.  Mankind cannot, in its present plight bear new shocks
and quarrels without taking to altogether cruder and primordial forms.
Yet we do not know that the hatred and confusion which are found will not
confront us with even harder trial than those we have so narrowly and painfully
survived.
In many countries, where even united efforts would fall short of what is needed,
party strife and faction is fomented or machine-made and skeleton fanatics rave at
each other about their rival ideologies.
All the while, the ordinary folk of every country show themselves kindly and
1Vide “Independence”VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 433brave and serviceable to their fellow men.  Yet, they are driven against one another
by forces and organizations and doctrines as wantonly and remorselessly as they ever
were in the ages of absolute emperors and kings.
There never was a time when breathing space was more needed, a blessed
convalescence, a truce of God and man.

APPENDIX XIV
SUGGESTED  POINTS  FOR  AGREEMENT  BETWEEN  THE
CONGRESS  AND  THE  MUSLIM  LEAGUE1
1.There shall be an All-India Union Government and Legislature dealing
with Foreign Affairs, Defence, Communications, Fundamental Rights and having the
necessary powers to obtain for itself the finances it requires for these subjects.
2.All the remaining powers shall vest in the provinces.
3.Groups of provinces may be formed and such Groups may determine the
provincial subjects which they desire to take in common.
4.The Groups may set up their own Executives and Legislatures.
5.The Legislature of the Union shall be composed of equal proportions from
the Muslim-majority provinces and from the Hindu-majority provinces whether or
not these or any of them have formed themselves into Groups, together with
representatives of the States.
6.The Government of the Union shall be constituted in the same proportion
as the Legislature.
7.The constitutions of the Union and the Groups (if any) shall contain a
provision whereby any province can by a majority vote of its Legislative Assembly
call for a reconsideration of the terms of the constitution after an initial period of ten
years and at ten yearly intervals thereafter.
For the purpose of such reconsideration a body shall be constituted on the
same basis as the original Constituent Assembly and with the same provisions as to
voting and shall have power to amend the constitution in any way decided upon.
8.The constitution-making machinery to arrive at a constitution on the
above basis, shall be as follows :
A.Representatives shall be elected from each Provincial Assembly in
proportion to the strength of the various parties in that Assembly on the basis of
1/10th of their numbers.
B.Representatives shall be invited from the States on the basis of their
population in proportion to the representation from British India.

possible in New Delhi.
D.After its preliminary meeting at which the general order of business will
be settled, it will divide into three sections, one section representing the Hindu-
majority provinces, one section representing the Muslim-majority provinces and one
representing the States.
E.The first two sections will then meet separately to decide the provincial
constitutions for their Groups and, if they wish, a Group constitution.
F.When these have settled it will be open to any province to decide to opt
out of its original Group and go into the other Group or to remain outside any Group.
G.Thereafter the three bodies will meet together to settle the constitution
for the union on the lines agreed in paragraphs 1-7 above.
H.No major point in the Union constitution which affects the communal
issue shall be deemed to be passed by the Assembly unless a majority of both the two
major communities vote in its favour.
9.The Viceroy shall forthwith call together the above constitution making
machinery which shall be governed by the provisions stated in paragraph 8 above.

TALK  WITH  HORACE  G.  ALEXANDER  AND  AGATHA  HARRISON1
Strictly confidential May 7, 1946
[G.]Two sides to talk—may be a favourable side but whole of talk left
unfavourable impression on me.
Idea is at any cost to please Jinnah—struggled hard to show this not proper
thing.
An attempt to prevent civil war—and civil war at any cost.  “We want to
prevent civil war coming”—but this can’t be prevented if hearts are not together.
Just now something should be imposed is thought.
Hatred is rampant—I have done the utmost in inducing faith—even if one is
not inclined to believe the evidence.  Hold that nothing is lost by this belief—in
spite of all that is said “I told you so”, etc.
He recounted steps taken to bring conference—Pethick-Lawrence’s 27th letter
and the replies of Azad and Jinnah.  The formula was only to “start discussion”.
Asked by Horace Alexander, “What did you advice?” Gandhiji said, “Don’t

“Letter to Sir Stafford Cripps”, 8-5-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 435think of an award.” Patel had reminded him that Attlee had definitely stated there
would be no such thing.  He had advised them to pick up one  party in which they
believed and persuade them whichever party had the   greater justice and rightness on
its side; then they should deliver the goods and say, ‘We trust you with power.’ This
might be the Muslim League.  If justice and right not on the Muslim League side then
deliver the goods to the major party.
Here the Sardar said he did not know how they would prevent civil war by this
method.  “They seem to have come to an agreement with Jinnah to do anything to
placate him.  We took Attlee’s speech [in good faith] otherwise we should not have
come.”
Gandhiji said that a better interpretation was they did not want to impose a
formula—that they sincerely believed that Jinnah had come round.  Patel said they
were impressed with fact that Jinnah could create trouble.  In effect they were saying,
‘If you want to avoid civil war—you must agree’.  This was an incitement.
Gandhiji said the Ministers admitted that they had sinned and that because of
this they were here.  Gandhiji said he felt this should be publicly stated.
Regarding what Horace and I should do Gandhiji said, “Watch and pray”; that it
would be dangerous to build on his account of the talk last night that his
conversations were based on a fear.  Therefore for us to act on the account he had
given would be wrong.  He had challenged them and they were sending along [ sic].

LETTER  FROM  LORD  WAVELL1
VICEROY’S  CAMP,  INDIA,  (SIMLA),
May 10, 1946
DEAR  MR.  GANDHI,
The Finance Member reports to me that rumours about a possible reduction or
abolition of the salt duty are almost certain to cause a salt famine in certain areas
unless immediate steps are taken to prevent it.  Merchants and wholesale dealers are
abstaining from placing orders with the salt manufacturers lest they be caught with
large stocks on which they have paid duty, but which they may be able to sell only at
a lower duty-free rate.  Strong representations have been received from the Bombay
salt merchants and Shilotries Association on the subject.

action.

PRESS  NOTE
Complaints have been received by Government that rumours to the effect that
the salt duty may be reduced or abolished have sown doubt and uncertainty in the
minds of traders and manufacturers to such an extent as to discourage the purchase of
salt, thereby hampering trade and slowing down manufacture and, in view of the
present chronic transport difficulties and of the further difficulty of transporting this
commodity during the wet months, entailing serious risk of a salt famine in
upcountry areas.  To obiate these risks, Government desires to make clear that any
change would only be made after a full and comprehensive investigation which would
necessarily take considerable time, and that ample notice would be given in order to
permit the disposal of duty-paid stocks.

INTERVIEW  WITH  LORD  WAVELL  AND  CABINET  MISSION1
May 6, 1946
We had decided early in the afternoon that it would be a good thing to see
Gandhi at once and enlist his support for the proposed solution, as Cripps was
confident he could do.  For some reason the Delegation wished him to be asked merely
to see the Viceroy, and they would drop in later, which is all rather in a line with their
methods of indirect approach.  It was Gandhi’s day of silence which he could not
break till 7.50 p. m.  He came at 7.30 p. m. and I spoke a monologue for 15 minutes
or so, telling him generally how things were going.  Then the Delegation came            
in, just as his silence was up, and the Secretary of State and Cripps started                    
their explanations and blandishments.  The result was a shock to them.  Gandhi,     
who had been living with Ghaffar Khan and Patel, the two malcontents, had adopted
entirely their point of view, said the proposed solution was “worse than Pakistan”,
and he could not recommend it to Congress we must either adopt entirely the

it juster; but there was no half-way house.  Gandhi seemed quite unmoved at the
prospect of civil war, I think he had adopted Patel’s thesis that if we are firm the
Muslims will not fight.  Though Cripps and Secretary of State kept at Gandhi for an
hour, till 9 p. m., they quite failed to move him.

and where there is no occasion for sense of time.
All have their wants satisfied,
Here all barter is just,
Here all are cast in the same mould,
Here is no lack nor care,
No selfishness in shape or form,
No high no low, no master no slave,
All is light yet no burning heat,

STATEMENT  OF  CABINET  DELEGATION  AND  VICEROY1
May 16, 1946
1.On march 15th last just before the despatch of the Cabinet Delegation to
India, Mr. Attlee, the British Prime Minister, used these words :
“My colleagues are going to India with the intention of using their utmost
endeavours to help her to attain her freedom as speedily and fully as possible.  What
form of Government is to replace the present regime is for India to decide; but our
desire is to help her to set up forthwith the machinery for making that decision. . . . I
hope that India and her people may elect to remain within the British
Commonwealth.  I am certain that they will find great advantages in doing so. . . . But
if she does so elect, it must be by her own free will.  The British Commonwealth and
Empire is not bound together by chains of external compulsion.  It is a free
association of free peoples.  If, on the other hand, she elects for independence, in our
view she has a right to do so.  It will be for us to make the transition as smooth and
easy as possible.”
2.Charged in these historic words we—the Cabinet Ministers and the
Viceroy—have done our utmost to assist the two main political parties to reach
agreement upon the fundamental issue of the unity or division of India.  After
prolonged discussions in New Delhi we succeeded in bringing the Congress and the
Muslim League together in Conference at Simla.  There was a full exchange of views
and both parties were prepared to make considerable concessions in order to try and
reach a settlement but it ultimately proved impossible to close the remainder of the
gap between the parties and so no agreement could be concluded.  Since no agreement
has been reached we feel that it is our duty to put forward what we consider are the best
arrangements possible to ensure a speedy setting up of the new Constitution.  This
statement is made with the full approval of His Majesty’s  Government in the United
Kingdom.
3.We have accordingly decided that immediate arrangements should               
be made whereby Indians may decide the future Constitution of India and                      
an Interim Government may be set up at once to carry on the administra-                   
tion of British India until such time as a new Constitution can be brought                
into being.  We have endeavoured to be just to the smaller as well as to the              
larger sections of the people; and to recommend a solution which will lead                      
to a practicable way of governing the India of the future, and will give a sound basis
for defence and a good opportunity for progress in the social, political and economic
field.
4.It is not intended in this Statement to review the voluminous evidence
1 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 16-5-1946VOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 439that has been submitted to the Mission; but it is right that we should state that it has
shown an almost universal desire, outside the supporters of the Muslim League, for
the unity of India.
5.This consideration did not, however, deter us from examining closely and
impartially the possibility of a partition of India; since we were greatly impressed by
the very genuine and acute anxiety of the Muslims lest they should find themselves
subjected to a perpetual Hindu-majority rule.
This feeling has become so strong and widespread amongst the Muslims that it
cannot be allayed by mere paper safeguards.  If there is to be internal peace in India it
must be secured by measures which will assure to the Muslims a control in all matters
vital to their culture, religion, and economic or other interests.
6.We therefore examined in the first instance the question of a separate and
fully independent sovereign State of Pakistan as claimed by the Muslim League.  Such
a Pakistan would comprise two areas; one in the north-west consisting of the
Provinces of the Punjab, Sind, North-West Frontier, and British Baluchistan; the
other in the north-east consisting of the Provinces of Bengal and Assam.  The League
were prepared to consider adjustment of boundaries at a later stage, but insisted that
the principle of Pakistan should first be acknowledged.  The argument for a separate
State of Pakistan was based first, upon the right of the Muslim majority to decide
their method of Government according to their wishes, and secondly, upon the
necessity to include substantial areas in which Muslims are in a minority, in order to
make Pakistan administratively and economically workable.
The size of the non-Muslim minorities in a Pakistan comprising the whole of
the six Provinces enumerated above would be very considerable as the following
figures1     show :

Muslims Muslims

51.69% 48.31%
The Muslim minorities in the remainder of British India number some 20
million dispersed amongst a total population of 188 million.
These figures show that the setting up of a separate sovereign State of
Pakistan on the lines claimed by the Muslim League, would not solve the communal
minority problem; nor can we see any justification for including within a sovereign
Pakistan those districts of the Punjab and of Bengal and Assam in which the
population is predominantly non-Muslim.  Every argument that can be used in favour
of Pakistan, can equally in our view be used in favour of the exclusion of the non-
Muslim areas from Pakistan.  This point would particularly affect the position of the
Sikhs.
7.We therefore considered whether a smaller sovereign Pakistan confined to
the Muslim majority areas alone might be a possible basis of compromise.  Such a
Pakistan is regarded by the Muslim League as quite impracticable because it would
entail the exclusion from Pakistan of (a) the whole of the Ambala and Jullundur
Division in the Punjab; (b) the whole of Assam except the District of Sylhet; and (c) a
large part of Western Bengal, including Calcutta, in which city the Muslims form
23.6 per cent of the population.  We ourselves are also convinced that any solution
which involves a radical partition of the Punjab and Bengal, as this would do, would
be contrary to the wishes interests of a very large proportion of the inhabitants of
these Provinces.  Bengal and the Punjab each has its own common language and a
long history and tradition.  Moreover, any division of the Punjab would of necessity
divide the Sikhs leaving substantial bodies of Sikhs on both sides of the boundary.
We have therefore been forced to the conclusion that neither a larger nor a smaller
sovereign State of Pakistan would provide an acceptable solution for the communal
problem.
8.Apart from the great force of the foregoing arguments there are weighty
administrative, economic and military considerations.  The whole of the
transportation and postal and telegraph systems of India have been established on the
basis of a united India.  To disintegrate them would gravely injure both parts of India.
The case for a united defence is even stronger.  The Indian armed forces have been
built up as a whole for the defence of India as a whole, and to break them in two would
inflict a deadly blow on the long traditions and high degree of efficiency of the IndianVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 441Army and would entail the gravest dangers.  The Indian Navy and Indian Air Force
would become much less effective.  The two sections of the suggested Pakistan
contain the two most vulnerable frontiers in India and for a successful defence in
depth the area of Pakistan would be insufficient.
9.A further consideration of importance is the greater difficulty which the
Indian States would find in associating themselves with divided British India.
10.Finally there is the geographical fact that the two halves of the proposed
Pakistan State are separated by some seven hundred miles and the communications
between them both in war and peace would be dependent on the goodwill of
Hindustan.
11.We are therefore unable to advise the British Government that the power
which at present resides in British hands should be handed over to two entirely
separate sovereign States.
12.This decision does not however blind us to the very real Muslim
apprehensions that their culture and political and social life might become submerged
in a purely unitary India, in which the Hindus with their greatly superior numbers
must be a dominating element.  To meet this the Congress have put forward a scheme
under which Provinces would have full autonomy subject only to a minimum of
Central subjects, such as Foreign Affairs, Defence and Communications.
Under this scheme Provinces, if they wished to take part in economic and
administrative planning on a large scale, could cede to the Centre optional subjects in
addition to the compulsory ones mentioned above.
13.Such a scheme would, in our view, present considerable constitutional
disadvantages and anomalies.  It would be very difficult to work a Central Executive
and Legislature in which some Ministers, who dealt with Compulsory subjects, were
responsible to the whole of India while other Ministers, who dealt with optional
subjects, would be responsible only to those Provinces which had elected to act
together in respect of such subjects.  This difficulty would be accentuated in the
Central Legislature, where it would be necessary to exclude certain members from
speaking and voting when subjects with which their Provinces were not concerned
were under discussion.
Apart from the difficulty of working such a scheme, we do not consider that it
would be fair to deny to other Provinces, which did not desire to take the optional
subject at the Centre, the right to form themselves into a group for a similar purpose.
This would indeed be no more than the exercise of their autonomous powers in a
particular way.
14.Before putting forward our recommendations we turn to deal with               
the relationship of the Indian States to British India.  It is quite clear that               
with the attainment of independence by British India, whether inside or out-            
side the British Commonwealth, the relationship which has hitherto existed     442 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIbetween the Rulers of the States and the British Crown will no longer be         
possible.  Paramountcy can neither be retained by the British Crown nor         
transferred to the new Government.  This fact has been fully recognised by those
whom we interviewed from the States.  They have at the same time assured us that the
States are ready and willing to co-operate in the new development of India.  The
precise form which their co-operation will take must be a matter for negotiation
during the building up of the new constitutional structure, and it by no means follows
that it will be indentical for all the States.  We have not therefore dealt with the States
in the same detail as the Provinces of the British India in the paragraphs which
follow.
15.We now indicate the nature of a solution which in our view would be just
to the essential claims of all parties, and would at the same time be most likely to
bring about a stable and practicable form of constitution for all India.
We recommend that the constitution should take the following basic form :
(1)There should be a Union of India, embracing both British India and the
States, which should deal with the following subjects : Foreign Affairs,
Defence, and Communications; and which should have the powers
necessary to raise the finances required for the above subjects.
(2)The Union should have an Executive and a Legislature constituted from
British Indian and States’ representatives.  Any question raising a major
communal issue in the Legislature should require for its decision a
majority of the representatives present and voting of each of the two
major communities as well as a majority of all the members present and
voting.
(3)All subjects other than the Union subjects and all residuary powers should
vest in the Provinces.
(4)The States will retain all subjects and powers other than those ceded to the
Union.
(5)Provinces should be free to form Groups with executives and legislatures,
and each Group could determine the Provincial subjects to be taken in
common.
(6)The Constitution of the Union and of the Groups should contain a
provision whereby any Province could, by a majority vote of its
Legislative Assembly, call for a reconsideration of the terms of the
constitution after an initial period of 10 years and at 10 yearly intervals
thereafter.
16.It is not our object to lay out the details of a constitution on the above
lines, but to set in motion the machinery whereby a constitution can be settled by
Indians for Indians.
It has been necessary however for us to make this recommendation as to theVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 443broad basis of the future constitution because it becomes clear to us in the course of
our negotiations that not until that has been done was there any hope of getting the
two major communities to join in the setting up of the constitution-making
machinery.
17.We now indicate the constitution-making machinery which we propose
should be brought into being forthwith in order to enable a new Constitution to be
worked out.
18.In forming any Assembly to decide a new Constitutional structure the first
problem is to obtain as broad-based and accurate a representation of the whole
population as is possible.  The most satisfactory method obviously would be by
election based on adult franchise; but any attempt to introduce such a step now would
lead to a wholly unacceptable delay in the formulation of the new Constitution.  The
only practicable alternative is to utilize the recently elected Provincial Legislative
Assemblies as the electing bodies.  There are, however, two factors in their
composition which make this difficult.  First, the numerical strength of the
Provincial Legislative Assemblies do not bear the same proportion to the total
population in each Province.  Thus, Assam with a population of 10 millions has a
Legislative Assembly of 108 members, while Bengal, with a population six times as
large has an Assembly of only 250.  Secondly, owing to the weightage given to
minorities by the Communal Award, the strengths of the several communities in each
Provincial Legislative Assembly are not in proportion to their numbers in the
Province.  Thus the number of the seats reserved for Muslims in the Bengal
Legislative Assembly is only 48 per cent of the total, although they form 55 per cent
of the Provincial population.  After a most careful consideration of the various
methods by which these inequalities might be corrected, we have come to the
conclusion that the fairest and the most practicable plan would be—
(a)to allot to each Province a total number of seats proportional to its
population, roughly in the ratio of one to a million, as the nearest
substitute for representation by adult suffrage.
(b)to divide this provincial allocation of seats between the main
communities in each Province in proportion to their population.
(c)to provide that the representatives allotted to each community in a
Province shall be elected by the members of that community in its
Legislative Assembly.
We think that for these purposes it is sufficient to recognize only three main
communities in India; General, Muslim, and Sikh, the “General” community
including all persons who are not Muslims or Sikhs.  As the smaller minorities
would, upon the population basis, have little or no representation, since they would
lose the weightage which assures them seats in the Provincial Legislatures, we have
made the arrangements set out in paragraph 20 below to give them a full444 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIrepresentation upon all matters of special interest to the minorities.
(19) (i) We therefore propose that there shall be elected by each Pro-         
vincial Legislative Assembly the following numbers of representatives, each part      
of the Legislative (General, Muslim or Sikh) electing its own representatives             
by the method of proportional representation with the single transferable                      
vote :—

To Section B will be added a representative of British Baluchistan.
(ii)It is the intention that the States should be given in the final

basis of the calculations adopted for British India, exceed 93, but the method                  
of selection will have to be determined by consultation.  The States would in the
preliminary stage be represented by a Negotiating Committee.
(iii)The representatives thus chosen shall meet at New Delhi as soon as
possible.
(iv)A preliminary meeting will be held at which the general order of business
will be decided, a Chairman and other officers elected, and an Advisory Committee
(see paragraph 20 below) on the rights of citizens, minorities, and tribal and excluded
areas set up.  Thereafter the provincial representatives will divide up into three
sections shown A, B and C, in the Table of Representation in the sub-paragraph (i) of
this paragraph. 
(v)These sections shall proceed to settle the Provincial Constitutions for the
Provinces included in each section, and shall also decide whether any Group
Constitution shall be set up for those Provinces and, if so, with what provincial
subjects the Group should deal.  Provinces, shall have the power to opt out of the
Groups in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (viii) below.
(vi)The representatives of the Sections and the Indian States shall reassemble
for the purpose of settling the Union Constitution.
(vii) In the Union Constituent Assembly resolutions varying the provisions
of paragraph 15 above or raising any major communal issue shall require a majority
of the representatives present and voting of each of the two major communities.
The Chairman of the Assembly shall decide which (if any) of the resolutions
raise major communal issues and shall, if so requested by a majority of the
representatives of either of the major communities, consult the Federal Court before
giving his decision.
(viii) As soon as the new constitutional arrangements have come into
operation, it shall be open to any Province to elect to come out of any Group in
which it has been placed.  Such a decision shall be taken by the new legislature of the
Province after the first general election under the new constitution.
20.The Advisory Committee on the rights of citizens, minorities, and tribal
and excluded areas should contain full representation of the interests affected, and
their function will be to report to the Union Constituent Assembly upon the list of
Fundamental Rights the clauses for the protection of minorities, and a scheme for the446 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIadministration of the tribal and excluded areas, and to advise whether these rights
should be incorporated in the Provincial Group, or Union constitution.
21.His Excellency the Viceroy will forthwith request the Provincial
Legislatures to proceed with the election of their representatives and the States to set
up a Negotiating Committee.  It is hoped that the process of constitution-making can
proceed as rapidly as the complexities of the task permit so that the interim may be as
short as possible.
22.It will be necessary to negotiate a Treaty between the Union Constituent
Assembly and the United Kingdom to provide for certain matters arising out of the
transfer of power.
23.While the constitution-making proceeds, the administration of India has
to be carried on.  We attach the greatest importance therefore to the setting up at once
of an Interim Government having the support of the major political parties.  It is
essential during the interim period that there should be the maximum of co-operation
in carrying through the difficult tasks that face the Government of india.  Besides the
heavy task of day-to-day administration, there is the grave danger of famine to be
countered; there are decisions to be taken in many matters of post-war development
which will have a far-reaching effect on India’s future; and there are important
international conferences in which India has to be represented.  For all these purposes
a Government having popular support is necessary.  The Viceroy has already started
discussions to this end, and hopes soon to form an Interim Government in which all
the portfolios, including that of War Member, will be held by Indian leaders having
the full confidence of the people.  The British Government, recognising the
significance of the changes in the Government of India, will give the fullest measure
of co-operation to the Government so formed, in the accomplishment and in bringing
about as rapid and smooth a transition as possible.
24.To the leaders and people of India who now have the opportunity of
complete independence we would finally say this.  We and our Government and
countrymen hoped that it would be possible for the Indian people themselves to agree
upon the method of framing the new constitution under which they will live.  Despite
the labours which we have shared with the Indian Parties, and the exercise of much
patience and goodwill by all, this has not been possible.  We therefore now lay
before you proposals which, after listening to all sides and after much earnest
thought, we trust will enable you to attain your independence in the shortest time and
with the least danger of internal disturbance and conflict.  These proposals may not,
of course, completely satisfy all parties, but you will recognize with us that at this
supreme moment in Indian history statesmanship demands mutual accommodation.
We ask you to consider the alternative to acceptance of these proposals.  After
all the efforts which we and the Indian Parties have made together for agreement, weVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 447must state that in our view there in small hope of peaceful settlement by agreement of
the Indian Parties alone.  The alternative would therefore be a grave danger of
violence, chaos, and even civil war.  The result and duration of such a disturbance
cannot be foreseen; but it is certain that it would be a terrible disaster for many
millions of men, women and children.  This is a possibility which must be regarded
with equal abhorrence by the Indian people, our own countrymen, and the world as a
whole.  
We therefore lay these proposals before you in the profound hope that they
will be accepted and operated by you in the spirit of accommodation and good will in
which they are offered.  We appeal to all who have the future good of India at heart to
extend their vision beyond their own community or interest to the interests of the
whole four hundred millions of the Indian people.
We hope that the new independent India may choose to be a member of the
British Commonwealth.  We hope in any event that you will remain in close and
friendly association with our people.  But these are matters for your own free choice.
Whatever that choice may be we look forward with you to your ever increasing
prosperity among the great nations of the world, and to a future even more glorious
than your past.

LORD  PETHICK-LAWRENCE’S  PRESS  CONFERENCE1
[May 17, 1946 ]
Q.Can the Constituent Assembly be regarded as sovereign in view of three
points that are put forward, viz.,
1.Adult suffrage has been ruled out;
2.British troops would continue to remain on the soil;
3.The principle and the procedure of the constitution-making body have
been laid down.
A.After dealing with the first two points the Secretary of State said :
The third question was whether, as we had laid down certain provisions, the
constitution-making body or Constituent Assembly could be regarded in any                      
sense as sovereign.  Well, we only laid these conditions down because Indians                   
did not come to an agreement among themselves.  If it had been possible for the              
two Indian parties to come together to make a constitution, we should have                  
made no stipulations of any kind.  But when we got here, we found, what we sus-
pected in advance, that a Constituent Assembly representing all parties could not               
be acceptable except on certain decisions taken in advance.  We then asked the                   
1Vide “Letter to Lord Pethick-Lawrence”, 19-5-1946448 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIndian parties whether they themselves by agreement would lay down certain
decisions which would enable the Constituent Assembly to meet together and           
to function, and we tried our very best to get that agreed to and we went a consi-
derable distance towards getting agreement on that point, but we did not get                 
all the way, and therefore only because of that we suggested this basis and we                  
made these recommendations, because it is only on those that we felt that we could
get representatives of all parties to sit together and try and draw up a constitution.
But even so, I would point [out] to you that even that basis can be altered but it can
only be altered by a separate majority of each party who desire to do so and the reason
is this that these representatives of different parties have never agreed to meet
together on that basis.  That is what we believe is the basis on which they will come
together.  If they do come together on that basis, it will mean that they will have
accepted that basis, but they can still change it if by a majority of each party they
desire to do so.

LETTER  FROM  LORD  PETHICK-LAWRENCE1
Confidential OFFICE  OF  THE  CABINET  DELEGATION ,
THE  VICEROY’S  HOUSE,
NEW  DELHI,
May 20, 1946
MY  DEAR  GANDHIJI,
Since receiving your two letters of the 19th and 20th, we have had an official
communication from the Congress raising the same points.2
As we intend shortly to reply to this letter I will not in this answer deal with
the various matters you raise.3
As some of the paragraphs in your second letter do not accord with my
recollection or that of Sir Stafford, I am enclosing a note setting out the matters on
which we differ.  We confirm as you imply in your paragraphs 6 and 7 that we told you
quite definitely that we could not agree with the propositions you there set out.  The
Delegation wish me in particular to make it plain that independence must follow and
not precede the coming into operation of the new Constitution.
All good wishes.
Sincerely yours,
PETHICK-LAWRENCE

1.We gave no such assurance but stated that we were investigating the
position on the lines stated.
2.On this matter we said there would have to be consultations as set out in
paragraph 14 of the Statement which we read to you and that a part of them would no
doubt be between the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes and the President of
Congress.
3.This was your suggestion.  We stated that it was proposed to appoint a
person in the best way possible to ensure his representative character.
4.In the second paragraph you are misinterpreting what Sir Stafford said.
He stated that he knew the view was held that in the past Paramountcy had been used
in certain cases to support the Princes against their people but that in the interim
period the Crown Representative would want to help forward the movement towards
democracy in the States so as to make it easier for them to come into the Union.  It
was also stated by us that Paramountcy would be exercised by the Crown
Representative and that it would not be in consultation with the Interim Government,
though there might be consultation between the Interim Government and the States
on matters of common economic interest.

LETTER FROM ABUL KALAM AZAD TO LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE1
20  AKBAR   ROAD,
NEW  DELHI,
May 20, 1946
DEAR  LORD  PETHICK-LAWRENCE,
My Committee have carefully considered the Statement issued by the Cabinet
Delegation on May 16th, and they have seen Gandhiji after the interviews he has had
with you and Sir Stafford Cripps.  There are certain matters about which I have been
asked to write to you.
As we understand the Statement, it contains certain recommendations                   
and procedure for the election and functioning of the Constituent Assembly.                      
The Assembly itself, when formed, will in my Committee’s opinion, be a  soverign
body for the purpose of drafting the Constitution unhindered by  any external
authority, as well as for entering into a treaty.  Further that   it will be open to the
Assembly to vary in any way it likes the recommendations and the procedure
1 Vide “Letter to Lord Pethick-Lawrence”, 19-5-1946450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsuggested by the Cabinet Delegation.  The Constituent Assembly being a sovereign
body for the purpose of the Constitution, its final decisions will automatically take
effect.
As you are aware some recommendations have been made in your Statement
which are contrary to the Congress stand as it was taken at the Simla Conference and
elsewhere.  Naturally we shall try to get the Assembly to remove what we consider
defects in the recommendations.  For this purpose we shall endeavour to educate the
country and the Constituent Assembly.
There is one matter in which my Committee were pleased to hear Gandhiji say
that you were trying to see that the European members in the various Prvincial
Assemblies, particularly Bengal and Assam, would neither offer themselves as
candidates nor vote for the election of delegates to the Constituent Assembly.
No provision has been made for the election of a representative from British
Baluchistan.  So far as we know, there is no elected Assembly or any other kind of
chamber which might select such a representative.  One individual may not make
much of a difference in the Constituent Assembly.  But it would make a difference if
such an individual speaks for a whole province which he really does not represent in
any way.  It is far better not to have representation at all than to have this kind of
representation which will mislead and which may decide the fate of Baluchistan
contrary to the wishes of its inhabitants.  If any kind of popular representation can be
arranged, we would welcome it.  My Committee were pleased, therefore, to hear
Gandhiji say that you are likely to include Baluchistan within the scope of the
Advisory Committee’s work.
In your recommendations for the basic form of the Constitution (page 3 of the
printed draft, No. 5) you state that provinces should be free to form groups with
executives and legislatures and each group could determine the provincial subjects to
be taken in common.  Just previous to this you state that all subjects other than the
union subjects and all residuary powers should vest in the provinces.  Later on in the
Statement, however, on page 5 you state that the provincial representatives to the
Constituent Assembly will divide up into three sections and “these sections          
shall proceed to settle the Provincial Constitutions for the Provinces in each               
section and shall also decide whether any group constitution shall be set up for             
those Provinces”.  There apppears to us to be marked discrepancy in these two
separate provisions.  The basic provision gives full autonomy to a province to do
what it likes and subsequently there appears to be a certain compulsion in the                 
matter which clearly infringes that autonomy.  It is true that at a later                         
stage the Provinces can opt out of any group.  In any event it is not clear                 
how a Province or its representatives can be compelled to do something                  
which they do not want to do.  A Provincial Assembly may give a mandate to itsVOL. 90: 25 FEBRUARY, 1946 - 19 MAY, 1946 451representatives not to enter any group or a particular group or section.  As Sections B
and C have been formed it is obvious that one Province will play a dominating role in
the Section, the Punjab in Section B and Bengal in Section C.  It is conceivable that
this dominating Province may frame a Provincial Constitution entirely against the
wishes of Sind or the North-West Frontier Province or Assam.  It may even
conceivably lay down rules, for elections and otherwise, thereby nullifying the
Provision for a Province to opt out of a group.  Such could never be the intention as it
would be repugnant to the basic principles and policy of the Scheme itself.
The question of Indian States has been left vague and, therefore, I need not say
much about it at this stage.  But it is clear that State representatives who come into
the Constituent Assembly must do so more or less in the same way as the
representatives of the Provinces.  The Constituent Assembly cannot be formed of
entirely disparate elements.
I have dealt above with some points arising out of your Statement.  Possibly
some of them can be cleared up by you and the defects removed.  The principal point,
however, is, as stated above, that we look upon this Constituent Assembly as a
sovereign body which can decide as it chooses in regard to any matter before it and
can give effect to its decision.  The only limitation we recognize is that in regard to
certain major communal issues the decision should be by a majority of each of the two
major communities.  We shall try to approach the public and the members of the
Constituent Assembly with our own proposals for removing any defects in the
recommendations made by you.
Gandhiji has informed my Committee that you contemplate that British troops
will remain in India till after the establishment of the Government in accordance with
the instrument produced by the Constituent Assembly.  My Committee feel that the
presence of foreign troops in India will be a negation of India’s independence.  India
should be considered to be independent in fact from the moment that the National
Provisional Government is established.
I shall be grateful to have an early reply so that my Committee may come to a
decision in regard to your Statement.
Yours sincerely,
A.  K.  AZAD

LETTER FROM LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE TO ABUL KALAM AZAD1
May 22, 1946
The Delegation have considered your letter of 20th May and feel that the best
way to answer it is that they should make their general position quite clear to you.
Since the Indian Leaders after prolonged discussion failed to arrive at an agreement,
the Delegation have put forward their recommendations as the nearest approach to
reconciling the views of the two main parties.  The scheme therefore stands as a
whole and can only succeed if it is accepted and worked in a spirit of compromise and
co-operation.
You are aware of the reasons for the grouping of the Provinces, and this is an
essential feature of the scheme, which can only be modified by agreement between the
two parties.
There are two further points which we think we should mention.  First, in your
letter you describe the Constituent Assembly as a sovereign body, the final decisions
of which will automatically take effect.  We think the authority and the function of
the Constituent Assembly and the procedure which it is intended to follow are clear
from the Statement.  Once the Constituent Assembly is formed and working on this
basis, there is naturally no intention to interfere with its discretion or to question its
decisions.  When the Constituent Assembly has completed its labours, His Majesty’s
Government will recommend to Parliament such action as may be necessary for the
cession of sovereignty to the Indian people, subject only to two provisos which are
mentioned in the Statement and which are not, we believe controversial, namely,
adequate provision for the protection of minorities and willingness to conclude a
treaty to cover matters arising out of the transfer of power.
Secondly, while His Majesty’s Government are most anxious to secure that the
interim period should be as short as possible, you will, we are sure, appreciate that for
the reasons stated above independence cannot precede the bringing into operation of
a new Constitution.

POONA,
September 1, 1945
MY DEAR DHANNO1,
I wonder whether you know Gujarati, Hindustani or Sindhi,
seeing that you write to me in bad English? Your mother knows
Hindustani and Sindhi. Your father knew all the above three well. But
this I write in the language you evidently know best.
You see now is the time for every patriot to be tested. You wear
khadi not for family tradition which may or may not be good, not for
my sake (that would be of no use), not for the poor (there are other
ways of serving them perhaps), but for swaraj to be gained
non-violently. Then you have to wear and use khadi at all cost. Then
to strengthen your conviction you may add all the other causes. Use
of khadi is the least you should do and brave the little difficulty you
mention. Supposing you slave for a showy maintenance for 10 hours,
why won’t you lighten your slavery by doing recreative spinning for
half an hour daily? While you are doing it, you will have the glow of
spinning swaraj daily for half an hour. Very little if you were the only
one. But one can multiply oneself into forty crores and then there is
swaraj without perhaps more. But if you can say to yourself honestly
that you have no time for non-violent swaraj, you must leave khadi
alone and use the cloth you like best and forget family traditions, the
poor and me.
What are you earning? Are you married?
Love.

CHI. NARAHARI,
Khimji1 had brought your letter. I replied at once. You must
have got the reply by now.
I would not know if there was any defect in Khimji’s eye.
Generally I do not observe people too closely. And if the parties
choose each other despite one of them having an obvious defect, why
need a third person object? What right does even a father have ? I
have seen the blind and the crippled also getting married. I would be
very much surprised if Munnalal has raised any objection. When you
all who are quite independent have made a selection, what objection
can be raised?

Naraharibhai writes to tell me that as Khimji has a defect in his
eye you have raised an objection to his marrying Vina and are even
ready to write to her father. This surprises me. I, therefore, used an
“if” in my reply1 to Narahari.
When K. and N. have made the selection, what objection can we
have? Besides, how can you write to Vina’s father? Vina is not
marrying the man in defiance of anybody’s advice. I personally do
not see what right a father can have to interfere if the two have
selected each other despite an obvious defect in one of them. And do
all the blind remain unmarried?

malaria from nearby places. I can understand that all the institutions
will keep a check over the expenses incurred on it. But I feel that the
contribution should be the same from all. It is the duty of all of us to

42. DISCUSSION WITH NARENDRA DEV2 AND SURAJ
PRASAD AWASTHI
POONA,
[Before September 2, 1945 ]3
In the course of their interview, the two leaders asked Mahatma Gandhi as to
whether the Hindustan Mazdoor Sevak Sangh like the Indian National Congress and
the All-India Trade Union Congress could adopt the words “peaceful and legitimate”
instead of “truth and non-violence” in its constitution. Mahatma Gandhi is
understood to have replied that he disagreed with those who held that “truth and
1 Which was to be held in Poona from September 12 to 18
2 (1889-1956); President, All-India Kisan Sabha, 1939 and 1942; member,
All-India Congress Socialist Party and later Praja Socialist Party; Vice Chancellor,
Lucknow University and later Banaras Hindu University
3 This report appeared under the date-line “Cawnpore, September 5” with an
introductory note that “Acharya Narendra Dev and Suraj Prasad Awasthi, M.L.As., met
Mahatma Gandhi at Poona last week”. The discussion, therefore, must have taken
place before Sunday, September 2.20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHInon-violence” were not political terms. In the political context, the words “peaceful
and legitimate” were considered to be more appropriate. Even this expression,
Mahatma Gandhi said, had been introduced by him in the Congress constitution1.
Since they had to deal with the working class, the objection on grounds of political
terminology did not matter. The workers must be told in a straight and direct way as to
what they should or should not do.
 On the question of trusteeship, which was absent from the constitution of the
Sangh, Mahatma Gandhi is said to have pointed out that since the theory of
trusteeship was stressed by him and had a permanent association with his name, it
was legitimate to make it a matter of dispute. He said that he did not want to
accentuate class-struggle. The owners should become trustees. They might insist that
they should become trustees and yet they might choose to remain owners.
We shall then have to oppose and fight them. Satyagraha will
then be our weapon. Even if we want a classless society we should not
engage in a civil war. Non-violence should be depended upon to
bring a classless society.

I have your two letters. Pyarelal is not here.
Yes, times are such as to require breadth of vision and statesman-

war worse than the last. I expect to see you in India soon.
I am not writing separately to Dorothy in reply to her long

I appreciate your down-heartedness and devotion to Mridula4.
No one can help being devoted to her. Such is her work, sacrifice and
bravery. But you are mistaken if you feel that she will be lost to the
cause. The result should be quite the contrary.
 I shall hold you to your promise to write to me in good
Hindustani in two months’ time. You will also tell me what you have

46. LETTER TO JATINDAS M. AMIN
September 2, 1945
CHI. AMIN,
Today I am sending a wire1 regarding your fast. There is a rule
that no one should go on a fast without my permission. It is possible
that you are not aware of it but Prabhakar knows this.
Both of you are at fault in going on a fast. When all of you
should render service in treating [cholera] patients, why enfeeble
yourselves by fasting?
I would say that those who are not willing to be inoculated
against cholera should not be persuaded to do so by fasting. Those
who cannot abide by the rules of an institution should leave it. We do
not have such rules [in our Ashram]. I am primarily responsible for
this because I do not believe in inoculation, etc. Right from South
Africa I have been holding these views. We should make arrangements
for those who wish to be inoculated but we should not force those who
are unwilling by resorting to a fast. If you want to know when one can
go on a fast, come to me when I have some leisure.
Who were the persons involved in beating Kotwal? What
happened to him? Give me the details when you have time. Show this
letter to Prabhakar and others after translating it into Hindi.

I have your letter. What should I say? I am stuck here in Poona.
I have no idea when I shall be able to leave. I have no idea whether I
shall have to go to Bombay or not. The date for Bengal is not fixed
either. I only know that I shall not be going before October. I have
written to Profulla Babu.1 Sudhir Babu says one thing, Satis Babu
another, and Profulla Babu a third. I should like to go over to
Borkamta2. I do not know for how long. It cannot be for a month as
you suggest. That can happen only if I settle down in Bengal. I cannot
possibly settle down there.
I shall only say that you should stay on there till I arrive. Render
whatever service you can. Have faith in God. He will do what pleases
Him. I realize more and more every day that save God all else is
naught. I like nothing but work. Why should you seek a message
from me?

I have your letter. Either make a trust, or have the approval of
the Charkha Sangh or leave khadi work. Leave it if you do not wish to
work even under the Punjab branch. Forget about making money out
of khadi. Khadi is not meant for that. What will you gain by coming
to me? You can come over only after I go to Sevagram. I do not know
when that will be. I have hardly any time for talking. So if you wish to
ask anything, you had better write to me. It would be better that you
write about everything to Jajuji. He will consult me if he wants to.

DEAR FRIEND,
Your letter. I purposely write to you in English.
I mentioned not 14 letters in the Urdu script but 14 scripts
collected on the chart shown to you.
I see that you can listen to hearsay even though it is contrary to
the evidence of your senses. You should know that Kakasaheb is
himself a Maharashtrian and so are my many associates.
I was referring to a well-known verse of the Gita2. It asks us not
to leave what may appear to be a lesser duty for what may happen to
be a higher. And I paid a compliment to Maharashtrians who stick to
their jobs no matter how difficult they are.
Urdu is not so difficult as your friend has made it out. I know
many who have learnt the Urdu script in less than a week. My offer to
teach you Urdu script within a week still stands. I shall put before you
a deputy to teach you, if you care.

BAPA,
Can Bombay not collect 15 lakhs for a memorial for Mahadev?
If it is very difficult, we should not try it. It would not matter if we
failed. I would suggest that the amount raised in Bombay should be
added to the collection from Gujarat. The Bombay committee should
be incorporated with the Gujarat committee and the whole amount
should be spent for the Memorial. This would be befitting and would
bring credit to Mahadev’s name. I think the permanent place for the
Memorial should be in Ahmedabad. If a branch is necessary a place
can be rented in Bombay. Let me know if there is any defect in my
reasoning.

I am exceedingly sorry that I misplaced your letter and have
been the cause of troubling you to send me a copy. I have now read
the same and I had your telegram also about it. My personal opinion
is that there should be no distribution of seats but that elections should
be on a basis of adult suffrage and only one electorate. But mine is a
voice in the wilderness. Therefore, I am afraid, it will not count among
divided counsellors. You claim to represent 300 million. Congress is

Your letter. My further substantiation for my position comes
from my own life and that of others, Hindus and non-Hindus who
have tried to live the truth that is in us. I wholly accept your statement
that just as faith without work is dead so is work without faith and you
admit that you have begun to doubt yourself, i. e., your work. Doubt
and you are lost. Is it possible to go further and doubt the sacrifice
behind your work? My extensive experience tells me that work speaks

you have to be told at every step, there is no point in telling you
anything. Scolding Prabhakar, not listening to Kishorelalbhai and
lastly refusing to work when cholera is widespread, all this is unworthy
of you. I have sent a telegram1 today. If you can quietly serve at the

I have your letter. I have passed the budget for Rs. 810. I shall
pass the other one also but I have had a committee set up for the
camp2. I want to pass it after making any changes that may be
necessary after the committee submits its report. The committee has
given me the authority about Assam, so if there is any delay I shall be
to blame. But I shall not let that happen.
The purchase of muga3 should be taken in hand. With regard to
the method it will be enough if the following things are kept in mind:
1. Let the work of the camp be based on the principle of
self-sufficiency. This means that the camp should become self
sufficient by the time it is wound up. There would thus be no harm if
the camp is kept going for a longer period. Maybe, prolonging it will
lead to knowledge becoming richer and deeper.
2. Spinning and the entire processing of cotton should be done
with full knowledge.
 3. Some good craft should also be taught. That too should be
done with full knowledge. There should be perfect cleanliness in the
camp as also among individuals.

3 A variety of silk yarnVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 534. The basis of self-sufficiency should be silk.
5. The work of the camp should be done so far as possible by
the inmates. Let there be as few servants as possible.
6. The workers, as far as possible, should be women.
7. The camp should be located in or near a village and the life
in the camp should resemble the life of the villagers.
I have written this much by way of giving guidelines. The rules
that may be received from the central authority must be followed.
What I have written should be sufficient. If not, let me know.

I have no doubt that you are doing solid work. You have

of anger. Of course Bhansali appreciates your work but your work
should be its own reward. Don’t let there be any shortcoming for want
of appreciation from others. I know that you have a great capacity for
work. Rest assured that it will increase a lot if you give up your vanity.
You belong to the Ashram and I wish that you should not leave it. The
Ashram should be like a mother to you. How long, therefore, can you
stay away from it?
Keep writing to me. Show this letter to Sushilabehn, for I am not
writing at length to her.

121. LETTER TO M. VISVESVARAYYA
NATURE CURE CLINIC,
6 TODIWALA ROAD, POONA,
September 11, 1945
DEAR SIR VISVESVARAYYA1,
I have your letter of the 7th July. I know I am very late in
replying to it but it was inevitable. As it is I am sending even this late
line under pressure. I appreciate your zeal in the cause you have at
heart and marvel at the fact that at your time of life you throw into
your work so much energy and thought. There, however, my
appreciation, I fear, stands.
Of course, verbally our objectives appear the same but when I
look at our means, the difference seems to me to be unbridgeable. It
may be that both of us being old and hardened are unable to see eye
to eye. If you regard South Africa as an elongated part of the West, I
have passed the best part of my life in the West. I have seen people,
high and low, working with amazing speed and with the most modern
machinery, the income of the commonest European labourer being
higher than that of the American. Yet it was there that I learnt to recoil
from their method and manner. They preyed upon the misery of the
1 Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya(1861-1962); engineer and statesman;
ex-Dewan of Mysore56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHINegro, holding him and his wife as beasts of burden. Things,
therefore, that attract you do not attract me but rather repel me. Much
as I would love to work as a humble co-worker side by side with you, I
cannot.
Your detailed, patient replies1 carefully prepared, fail to convince
me. What is the use of taxing you further with my questions? Let me
tell you that I claim to have been working schemes fairly successfully
among the village population with well-knit organizations. Nearly
four crores (as I can recall) have been distributed among the villagers,
not as doles, but for solid work done—and this in the face of heavy
odds. Had it not been for the opposition of the Government and their
unreasoned wrath after the August of 1942, the said organizations
would have shown greater results. But I cannot expect you with your
Krishnasagar marvels to your credit even to look at my scheme. I can,
therefore, only conclude by expressing my eagerness to follow not
your scheme but your solid work and learn from it, if I see anything
to learn.
I hope you are keeping perfectly well and fit.
Yours sincerely,

the work, I will welcome it. I do not understand Ramprasad asking for
still higher pay, but if Jajuji decides to increase it I will not object. I
myself will not be able to decide in the matter. If Ramprasad
undertakes to look after the construction of the building, will the
couple stay there or continue to stay in the Ashram? This also will
have to be decided by you.

practice of offering 1_ per cent discount to any member buying
khadi worth Rs. 100 from the store which you are running or the
stores which are being run under your supervision in Kathiawar. If the
Charkha Sangh accepts this rule, it should decide to buy khadi only
from the stores under the control of the respective branches. If,58 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIinstead, a member from Kanyakumari wants to buy khadi from a store
under the Punjab branch, there will be a danger of extensive
malpractices.
Your scheme does have my blessings, of course. I will, moreover,
definitely send something with anybody from here going there.
Balasaheb Kher is engaged on the 2nd and the 3rd. He,
therefore, cannot come. He has suggested the following names in his
place. Narahari Parikh, Morarji Desai, Kaka Kalelkar, Dada Maval-
ankar. From among them Kaka Kalelkar is here. I met him. I think he
will be able to give the maximum work. Narahari cannot be spared at
all just now. He has taken upon himself a lot of work. Kaka can arrive
there on the 1st and must return on the 4th. He will not, therefore, be
able to undertake a long tour there. He has agreed to attend an
important meeting in Bombay on the 6th.
You are entering your 60th year today, but according to me you
should aspire to live for another 60 years still. You may, therefore, be
said to have completed half the journey. Only today I read in a book
that a man should aspire to live 150 years. Even if the millions could
entertain such an aspiration, it would be meaningless, for the condition
affixed is that the person concerned should spend all these years in
service in the spirit of yajna, that is, without attachment. It is an
extremely dfficult job to practise non-attachment. But anybody who
can cultivate it is sure to live up to 125, and you have the ability to
cultivate it.1

BHAI JAJUJI,
I am sending Narandas’s statement and his letter along with this.
Go through it and if you think that what he has stated is right, we
should try to have such members from all over the country. I think it
is almost impossible to implement what he has suggested regarding
the Congress as we do not have the required atmosphere. If we
1 Vide also the following item.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 59succeed in getting [enough] members we may be able to create the
atmosphere. That is to say the Charkha Sangh has to impress the
Congress by its own work. We have to devise the ways of gaining the
strength to do so.

126. LETTER TO LORD WAVELL
NATURE CURE CLINIC,
6 TODIWALA ROAD, POONA,
September 14, 1945
DEAR FRIEND,
I am sorry that I have to worry you almost immediately on your
return from London. My only excuse is that my mission is purely
humanitarian.
Shri Haridas Mitra, an M.A. of the Calcutta University and the
husband of Shri Subhas Chandra Bose’s young niece1, aged 22 years,
is under sentence of death over what appears to be an untenable
ground. I have perused the petition for mercy by the uncle of the
condemned as also of Advocate Carden Noad. I suggest that they
furnish cogent grounds for the exercise of mercy. In any event the
case for mercy becomes irresistible in that the war with Japan is over.
It will be a political error of the first magnitude if this sentence of
death is carried into effect. I rejoiced to learn that you had ordered
postponement of execution till after consideration of the case by you
on your return.
My attention was drawn to the case by the prisoner’s wife as she
has often sung at my prayer meetings when I had the honour of being
a guest of Advocate Sarat Chandra Bose whom I am happy to learn
the Government of India has ordered to be released.2
Yours sincerely,

 132. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING
POONA,
September 14, 1945
This is a place for prayers and not for public meetings. By their
foolish and improper behaviour, those who disturbed me and other
occupants in the clinic have demonstrated that they did not come for
prayer.1 I know there are people who do not believe in the existence
of God. I met them in England and there may be some here. They
ask, ‘Where is God ?’ and ‘If there is God, why is there so much
distress in this world ?’ But those who believe in God and prayers
cannot show God. We expect that these prayers will have some effect
on the minds of those who join us in the prayers.
I know you love your leaders and want to see and hear them.
But it is wrong to force them to come out here after the hard work
they have been doing or when they have left this place. You will have
opportunity to see and hear them at other public meetings. I,
1 Some people had created a scene the previous night for seeing Jawaharlal

There is no question of my being offended. I had read the
portion regarding Parnerkar, I had no comment to make on it.
Something can be done only after I return there. I have in any case
written to Parnerkar.1 I myself feel confused.
You yourself told me that you speak too much. You lose
patience and get angry. If you forget this fact, how will you be able to
reform yourself ? You work hard enough, but spoil everything by
speaking too much. Won’t you admit this ? What matters in the prayer
is the tune. It is a matter of common sense as to what should be done
when your voice is not in tune with that of others or the voices of
others are not in tune with yours. Praying therefore is not the remedy.
The question is of knowing the tune.
Go on serving. I learnt much from the cholera. Let others also

POONA,

BHAI SHYAMLAL,
I got your letter of the 7th instant a few days ago. In one of the
circulars I see that people have been asked to send their replies by the
21st or 22nd September at the time of the Committee’s meeting. If
the pamphlet was to be sent only after you got my reply, then the time
is over. Till today I have not been able to read the pamphlet. And ever
if I had sent my reply, I think it would have been impossible to send
the circulars to all the Provinces and get their replies in time. How can
we work in such haste? And it is almost impossible for me to send my
reply by return of post. At times I could reply to brief letters but not
always. What shall we do in such a situation? It would be better not to
wait for my permission for what is to be done urgently and in case it is
imperative to have my permission I should be informed telegra-
phically. Then perhaps it would be possible for me to keep the reply
ready.
 I have gone through all the circulars. I think there is no need
for any amendment. If the circulars are not sent as yet, change the
dates and send them out and they should be placed before the
Committee’s next meeting or a copy should be sent to all after getting
the reply.
Yesterday I got Suchetabehn’s letter. I am enclosing it. It should
be kept in the office and a copy should be sent to Bapa. It would be
better that she gives us a trial and we give her a trial for three months.
And later on she can stay permanently if she is prepared to. She can
keep travelling between Allahabad and Wardha. I don’t find any

CHI. KAILAS,
I got your letter just as I reached Bombay. Your handwriting is
good but not clear enough to be read easily. If you write slightly
bigger letters and do not mix them up, it will be easier to decipher.
You cannot ride on two horses. A family cannot run properly if
all the children stay with the parents all the time. When children grow
older, they have to go out for earning, studying or serving. And when
they go out, they have to forget their old and ailing parents. So why
do you feel unhappy for what is inevitable? When your parents sent
you out, they and you yourself must have thought not only that your
duty was to serve your parents, but that it was time that you started
earning and lessened their burden. That is exactly what you are doing.
It is good that you are doing all your work and slowly learning every-
thing. You will bring credit to yourself, your parents and the Ashram
if you settle down there, stop worrying and take care of your health.
I am very happy to know that you wanted to have chillies but
gave them up on your own. I know that some people are so much
1 Ruler of Thana Devli, a State in Kathiawar76 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIused to chillies that they would rather die than give them up. This
shows that taking chillies is not a good habit. In India it so happens
that the poor cannot afford anything else and they add a few chillies
and salt to the rotla1 to somehow make it digestible. To conclude from
this that all must take chillies is sheer ignorance. When a person takes
all kinds of food including rotlas as well, the latter cannot be regarded
as part of his diet. On the contrary they may be superfluous and
might even prove to be harmful.

164. LETTER TO KRISHNACHANDRA
September 21, 1945
CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
I arrived here at 4 o’clock today. I have your letter.
When a person takes beer with two per cent alcohol content and
is forbidden to take whisky with 75 per cent alcohol content, can I ask
why beer and why not whisky? You must see also that when we drink
lemonade or eat things with some alcohol content in them nobody
says that we are taking alcohol. Equate chillies with whisky and then
consider if chillies can go with turmeric or coriander. Taking spices
does not mean consuming all kinds of spices. There is said to be a lot
of difference between green chillies and red chillies. It is surprising
that all these simple things have escaped your attention. Whatever
spices we give, like turmeric, black pepper, coriander, etc., are given
on doctor’s recommendation and on grounds of health. Even so, who
can prevent anyone from eating for taste, and how can it be done?
Have you not heard that a Vaghari2 woman used to relish greatly a
two-day stale bajra chapati without ghee, but when she was given
kheer3 and wheat halwa43 to eat every day she started shrinking and
fell ill in the end. Shall we then say that this Vaghari woman had con-
quered her palate and subsisted on dry bread, chillies and salt? What
else should I write?
1 Chapati made from baejra or jowar flour
2 Name of a backward community
3 Sweet preparations
4 ibidVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 77Why did you not ask me till today about taking chillies on
grounds of health? Of course we do let Shakaribehn have chillies
willingly. But how can we give it to others? The reason is not that
chillies have no good qualities at all. They certainly have some
medicinal value. But chillies have no place in a hospital except as a
“pain-killer” which is an extract of chillies. In the Ashram we neither
take nor give anything merely for taste. But we do not ask everybody
whether they relish what they eat and if they do so they should leave
the Ashram. If we take this view, none but animals and birds will be
left in the Ashram.
Kamle should somehow calm down and improve his health.
I have already written about Purnachandraji. While living in the
Ashram everyone has to observe brahmacharya. I did not know about
Ramprasadji. But I was under the impression that Ramprasad’s house
was a little away from the other houses of the Ashram. Niamat’s room
was also there but she was never asked whether she wanted to observe
brahmacharya. But I had thought that Ramprasad had not come to
live in the Ashram like Niamat. However, when I came to know that
the manner in which they lived they could even produce children I
was perturbed. Besides others this is the strorgest reason for one to
leave the Ashram. His having a separate kitchen also used to irk me.
But since this had been allowed in the case of others I could not be
too insistent in dissuading him.
 It is not enough to assume that Purnachandraji must be obser-
ving brahmacharya while staying in the Ashram. It is necessary to ask
him clearly.
I hope to go to Poona from here on the 24th.

BOMBAY,
September 21, 1945
Addressing a few words to the gathering which had waited patiently for prayer
time, Gandhiji said that he had taken permission from his doctors to offer prayer
under a shelter.1
1 Gandhiji had been advised complete rest on account of a mild attack of
influenza. He had not been able to attend the A.I.C.C. meeting.78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIAsking for contributions to the Harijan Fund, Gandhiji said that it would
please him more if people came forward with hand-spun yarn instead of cash. He
would prepare cloth out of this yarn and sell it to them as that would bring more
money. He said Bombay was the first city to contribute yarn. He hoped the citizens
would continue this practice.

illness, all the more because I cannot come to you. And now I see that
you cannot come to Poona tomorrow. Tell me unreservedly what you
will have me to do.
Your obstinacy is remarkable and it is responsible for your
suffering. But of that nothing just now. I dare mention this just now so
that you might remember this when you are well enough and shed it
without ado as you have done in everything else. If you cannot write
just pass your answer.
Love.

BHAI SANATKUMAR,
I have your letter. What you say is like a bad workman
quarrelling with his tools. If it is true that we can attain swaraj through
khadi you should, by taking some trouble, prepare fine slivers. But if
you find it difficult to do even that much, we cannot achieve swaraj
through ahimsa. It would be no loss either to the country or to the
cause of khadi if those who lacked this zeal left khadi alone. As

168. FOREWORD1
Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa has, in his pages on “Villagism”, a
new word coined by him, furnished the lay reader and the village
worker, not conversant with books on economics, a comparative and
historical study of the modern movements known as Capitalism and
Socialism, not excluding Marxism and Communism, and has
earnestly, and I think convincingly, shown, amongst other reasons
advanced by him, that the past two wars of our generation have proved
the utter bankruptcy of such economic orders. Incidentally, the wars
seem to me to have proved the bankruptcy of war, meaning in forcible
and naked language violence, which is not less because it is organized
by States reputed to be civilized. Whether non-violence will effectively
replace violence for keeping the peace of the world remains to be
seen. Certain it is that mankind, if it continues along its mad career of
exploitation of the weak by the strong, must rush to annihilation fore-
told in all religions. Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa shows that “Villagism”
as it is being attempted in India, based as it is on truth and non-
violence, is well calculated to avert the doom. If the reader is interested
in the life-saving process, he must turn to the instructive pages written
by Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa during his recent imprisonment.2

BHAI APPA,
I have your letter. I read the description of the Ganga flowing
near Rajapur. Keep me informed about what is going on. If the
pandas1 can be influenced by public opinion the case would not go to
the court. But if public opinion is of no avail, you must put up a
proper defence. If our case is weak, we should not defend it just for
the sake of defence. It often happens that morally we are right and if
by defending our case our position becomes clearer, in spite of
realizing that we will lose in the end, it becomes our dharma to defend
it. I have done this quite often and succeeded also. That is why I am
putting this before you. I hope Dadasaheb2 will reach there in time. I
do agree with you about the defects you have pointed out, but it is
possible that the leaders don’t. At least not all of them. But you have
every right to include all those things as defects. I would do so. Now
first of all, send all the questions in brief, in Urdu script to Maulana. I
think he will send a reply. Let him know your position. After waiting

there should ponder over K’s letter. How did a saintly person like
Kishorelal, working under Parnerkar, accept defeat? Do not get
muddled. Leave the letter aside if you are unable to make head or tail
of it. Everyone will not benefit by reading it. Only you three should
read it. Write to me if you can think of something after some
consultations; otherwise forget about it. Give it up if too much time is
consumed in discussion. Naraharibhai is the secretary of the
Committee, so he should think over both the letters: 1. Should the
institutions be kept separate ? Will that be possible now ? (The subject
matter of K.’s letter.,) 2. Can’t two neighbours live in amity? They
may cultivate the land separately and have their cattle, fruit trees, and
water supply separate. (The subject matter of Parnerkar’s letter.)

204. FOREWORD TO “NEHRU YOUR NEIGHBOUR”
POONA,
[September 30, 1945 ]1
This is an effective collection made by Shri P. D. Tandon2 out of
numerous writings of numerous admirers of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
It gives at a glance a good picture of the patriot as seen by various
eyes. He shines easily as father, brother, writer, traveller, patriot or
internationalist. Nevertheless it is as an ardent devotee of his country
and its freedom on whose altar he would sacrifice all his other loves
that the leader will specially single him out from the essays. Be it said
to his credit, however, that he will consider it beneath his dignity to
purchase that freedom at the price of any other country. His
nationalism is equal to internationalism.

Thanks for your cheque of Rs. 500. It will be utilized like the

Your puzzle remains a puzzle3. I submitted it here to a learned
man as I did in Sevagram. Nothing could be done by either. I suppose
a puzzle will cease to be one if it yields to an easy solution.
The Hindi translation though in defective Hindi is quite good

who are serving me or are eager to do so. If a time comes when no

need it have any? All this seems improper to me. If you have sent
anything to Nava Kal1 similar to what you wrote to me, you have
made a mistake.
I have written to Bapa regarding your camp. It is quite a few
days since I did that. You must get the permission row. It would of
course be excellent if a hospital could be run at the same time.
Why do you even have the suspicion that I am displeased with
Shankarraoji these days? I don’t tkink about that matter at all. I have
not read his article regarding Satara. I chance to read very few of such
writings.
The members of the Committee ought not to be concerned
whether I remain silent or rot.
It is probable that Narandas may come here after Rentia Baras.
What does it matter if you do not come to see me though you are so
near? So long as you are going on with the work, where is the need
for you to come and see me? When you have no work, you are of
course free to come.

In your postcard you say that your illness is negligible. But the
letters from the Ashram say that you have lost quite a bit.
Whatever you decide about Ramanlal2 is right. It will be good if
somehow he settles down.
It is surprising that there was no excitement on account of the
idols. Also it is surprising that the caste Hindus listen to Kamle’s
bhajans even after knowing about him.

 212. YARN QUOTA FOR KHADI PURCHASE1
[September 1945 ]
It is true that the Congress adopted khadi, the Spinners’
Association imposed the condition of the yarn quota and khadi which
is not certified by the Association is taboo for Congressmen. A certain
quantity of yarn has to be given as part of the price of khadi. All this
is true. But I do not find anything wrong in this. That action alone can
be compulsion where there is penalty for refusing to do a particular
thing. What the form of punishment should be is a different matter.
There is no compulsion if I demand the price of khadi and refuse to
give it free. Similarly there is some condition or other attached to
membership in any institution. It is also no compulsion if subseque-
ntly any change is made in such conditions. The case of uncertified
kkadi is also similar. If we go in for uncertified khadi, where is the
guarantee of its purity and that a proper wage has been paid to the
spinner ?
With the advance of time and experience, changes have to be
made in the rules and regulations. The only questions to be consi-
dered are whether the change fulfils the object, is in keeping with the
principle of truth and non-violence, and is actuated by selfish or
1 This was in reply to a correspondent who had asked: “You persuaded the
Congress to adopt khadi-wear for its members and introduced the rule of yarn quota for
the A. I. S. A. khadi. Congressmen are prohibited from using khadi other than that
certified by the A. I. S. A., and now khadi cannot be had from the Association without
paying the yarn quota. Is this not compulsion?”VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945  99benevolent motives. The answer to all these questions will show thatthe change was to fulfil the original object and the question of
compulsion does not arise.
I should be thanked if, against my goods, I ask for yarn or some
other commodity in place of money.
Let us go a little deeper. We believe that khadi is only for those
who believe that non-violen t swaraj can be establishe d by making
khadi universal . Spinning, even for a little time, by the greatest
number of people wil l be helpful in obtaining swaraj. We do not
therefore spin under compulsio n but of our own accord. An
additional gain is that through spinning we come in direct contact withthe poor.
Therefore, I am quite clea r that there is absolutel y no com-
pulsion in demanding part of  the price of khadi in the form of yarn.

MY DEAR C. R.,
I have read your letter1 to the Sardar. I detect in it your worry.
1 Dated September 28, 1945, whic h inter alia read: “The enclosed is a milder
version of the central story in th e Andhra Patrik a for which Dr. P. [Subbaroyan]’s
friends are responsible. The impression sought to be created is that Dr. P. has beenpitched upon by you as a leader, and that it is an integral part of the big plan!”100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIBut why worry? The Sardar has said nothing to anybody. He, however,
does feel that among Congress circles you have lost your popularity.1
That, however, should be matter of no moment to you. You will serve
if your services are required. My own opinion is that you will be
wanted in due time. But I do not want you to feel over the thing.
You do not imagine that the Sardar has a magic ward. He can go
only to a certain extent and no farther. If he overstepped his limits he
would lose what infIuence he has. What I suggest is that you should
come here whilst we are both here and let us amuse ourselves. Let the
elections2 take care of themselves. I would like your name among the
candidates but that too without an effort. But all these things can be
discussed here. You should give yourself ample time with me. You will
come to a friend, not as a Congressman to another, not on business.
The weather is quite good. You will not stay at Parnakuti3 this time.
You will come to the clinic. I shall see to your being suited. Hope you
are not too weak or too bad. Well or ill, you should be here.

Today I got your letter. I also read Salehbhai’s article. Some of
the things he says are true but neither Burma nor India has any power.
Nobody would listen to a true Indian or Burmese and he cannot do
much. The true dharma of India is to achieve independence and help
Burma and other countries to attain it. All this enmity would disappear
after both are free. At present no one will pay heed to what Salehbhai
says. He would be regarded as merely an official. My advice is that he
should silently serve [the cause] as much as he can. An official’s
dharma is not to speak but act.
Pass this on to Salehbhai.

I hope Kanchan and Hiramani are well now.
After you are free from the cholera work, you should take up
whatever work nobody else is doing. When you have no other work to
do, you should spin.
I am of the opinion that chillies should not be served except
when advised by a doctor. You may state your opinion and then
remain unconcerned.
I advised2 you not to join in singing the prayer, but did not
forbid you. Whenever you find my advice painful, you certainly need
not follow it. When you feel that you can join in, you may do so. You
should then go and stand at a distance and sing alone, constantly
changing the tune. You will thus learn the right tunes. There is a music
teacher in the Nayee Talim. Learn the sa-re-ga-ma3 from him.
Hiramani seems to have settled down in the Mahila Ashram. She
probably knows music; learn from her.
 As regards the plants, Kishorelal’s decision may be carried out.
Explain to me further when I return.
I think I have now replied to all the questions.

1. The dirt which is there in the clinic all the time should be
completely removed. There should not be any leakage. Cleanliness
should have the first place in nature-cure. If the expenses go up on
that account, let them.
2. I have taken deep thought about the clinic and am daily
thinking about it. I am convinced that you should run it. It is better
that we have a trust but that is a small thing. If a university is to come
up it will be only from the clinic. There won’t be any university if this
is entrusted to someone else. To leave this will mean giving up your
vocation. In order to raise a university, you must go and see all
1 Son of Maganlal Gandhi

as this is not achieved, all is in vain. All things have come up in the
world in this way. Money does not make universities.
 3. Working for villages is altogether a different thing. I can see
that at present you cannot work only in villages. You can’t handle
both the things single-handed. I don’t mind if village work is
postponed for the time being. It is good that a trust has been made. I
feel this should be well-founded and thoughtfully done. It will not be
desirable to back out after once starting it.
We shall sit together at 8.30 p. m. tomorrow and discuss all the

Thank God for Mother being somewhat better.2 It is remarkable
if a bone joins at the age of 80.
Normally it does not happen that I am not shown a letter which
has something important to say. But your letter seems to have come
when no letter was to be passed on to me.
It is a new thing for me that you are interested in horoscopes
and know something about them. I am sorry I cannot satisfy your
curiosity. I know that my horoscope was always kept perfect and up to
date but that practice died away with my father. He used to take
interest in it and got the yearly forecast from it. My elder brother’s3
eldest son Shamaldas has kept all the records, so he is likely to have
mine. I am writing to him. Perhaps you yourself know him. So write
to him. He is running Vandemataram, a daily.
One may say that these days I am quite all right. Get well and
write to me from time to time.

said: “. . . You would have noticed in the Press a totally unnecessary controversy
between Sarat Chandra Bose and me . . . . He is making a dead set against Chiang
Kai-Shek, which seems to me bad and harmful and likely to create unnecessary trouble
all round. None of us admires all that Chiang Kai-Shek has done. But it does seem to
be wrong for us to attack him in this way. He happens to be the head of the Chinese
State and so far as India is concerned his attitude has always been friendly. For my
part I have kept up friendly relations not only with Chiang Kai-Shek and the Chinese
Government but with many of his critics in China. I do not want this controversy
with Sarat, but to remain silent became impossible for me. . . .”

will have to go there. Ramdas also does not wish to bring her over to
Nagpur. Manilal and Sushila, too, are of the same view. My
suggestion, with which Manilal and Sushila agree, is that you should
go to Delhi. In your absence, Sushila will look after your home and
take care of Ramdas and Kanam. And so, you will be ab1e to remain
in Delhi without worrying about anything. Usha, too, may remain in
Nagpur. Both of you may think over the matter and then write or wire
to me so that Sushila can start from here. Neither of you should
entertain the doubt that Sushila will not be willing to go there. I hope

255. LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU
October 5, 1945
CHI. JAWAHARLAL,
I have long been intending to write to you but can do so only
today. I have also been wondering whether I should write in English
or Hindustani. In the end I have decided to write in Hindustani.
I take first the sharp difference of opinion that has arisen
between us. If such a difference really exists people should also know
about it, for the work of swaraj will suffer if they are kept in the dark.
I have said that I fully stand by the kind of governance which I have
described in Hind Swaraj1. It is not just a way of speaking. My
experience has confirmed the truth of what I wrote in 19092. If I were
the only one left who believed in it, I would not be sorry. For I can
only testify to the truth as I see it. I have not Hind Swaraj in front of
me. It is better that I redraw the picture today in my own language.
Then it would not matter to me whether or no the picture tallies with
that of 19093, nor should it to you. I do not have to establish what I
had said before. What is worth knowing is only what I have to say
today. I believe that if India, and through India the world, is to achieve
real freedom, then sooner or later we shall have to go and live in the
villages—in huts, not in palaces. Millions of people can never live in
cities and palaces in comfort and peace. Nor can they do so by killing
one another, that is, by resorting to violence and untruth. I have not
the slightest doubt that, but for the pair, truth and non-violence,
mankind will be doomed. We can have the vision of that truth and
non-violence only in the simplicity of the villages. That simplicity
1 Vide “Hind Swaraj”
2  The source however has “1908”.
3 ibidVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 119resides in the spinning-wheel and what is implied by the spinning-
wheel. It does not frighten me at all that the world seems to be going
in the opposite direction. For the matter of that, when the moth
approaches its doom it whirls round faster and faster till it is burnt up.
It is possible that India will not be able to escape this moth-like
circling. It is my duty to try, till my last breath, to save India and
through it the world from such a fate. The sum and substance of what
I want to say is that the individual person should have control over the
things that are necessary for the sustenance of life. If he cannot have
such control the individual cannot survive. Ultimately, the world is
made up only of individuals. If there were no drops there would be no
ocean. This is only a rough and ready statement. There is nothing new
in this.
But even in Hind Swaraj  I have not said all this. While I appre-
ciate modern thought, I find that an ancient thing, considered in the
light of this thought looks so sweet. You will not be able to understand
me if you think that I am talking about the villages of today. My ideal
village still exists only in my imagination. After all every human
being lives in the world of his own imagination. In this village of my
dreams the villager will not be dull—he will be all awareness. He will
not live like an animal in filth and darkness. Men and women will live
in freedom, prepared to face the whole world. There will be no plague,
no cholera and no smallpox. Nobody will be allowed to be idle or to
wallow in luxury. Everyone will have to do body labour. Granting all
this, I can still envisage a number of things that will have to be
organized on a large scale. Perhaps there will even be railways and
also post and telegraph offices. I do not know what things there will
be or will not be. Nor am I bothered about it. If I can make sure of
the essential thing, other things will follow in due course. But if I give
up the essential thing, I give up everything.
The other day, at the final day’s meeting of the Working
Committee, we had taken a decision to the effect that the Working
Committee would meet for two or three days to work out this very
thing. I shall be happy if it meets. But even if it does not meet, I want
that we two should understand each other fully. And this for two
reasons. Our bond is not merely political. It is much deeper. I have no
measure to fathom that depth. This bond can never be broken. I
therefore want that we should understand each other thoroughly in
politics as well. The second reason is that neither of us considers120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhimself as worthless. We both live only for India’s freedom, and will
be happy to die too for that freedom. We do not care for praise from
any quarter. Praise or abuse are the same to us. They have no place in
the mission of service. Though I aspire to live up to 125 years
rendering service, I am nevertheless an old man, while you are
comparatively young. That is why I have said that you are my heir.1 It
is only proper that I should at least understand my heir and my heir in
turn should understand me. I shall then be at peace.
One thing more. I had written to you2 about Kasturba Trust and
Hindustani. You had said you would write after thinking things over. I
find that your name is already figuring in the Hindustani Sabha.
Nanavati reminded me that he had approached you and Maulana
Saheb and that you had appended your signature. That was in 1942.
That was long ago. You know where Hindustani stands today. If you
still stand by that signature, I wish to get some work out of you in this
regard. It will not involve much running about, but some work will be
called for.
The work of Kasturba Memorial Trust is rather complicated. I
realize that if what I have said above is going to irk you or is irking
you, you will not feel comfortable even in the Kasturba Trust.
The last point concerns the sparks that are flying about in the
conflict with Sarat Babu.3 I have been pained by the episode. I have
been unable to trace it to its root. If what you have told me is all there
is to it and nothing more remains to be said, then I do not have to
inquire further. But if an explanation seems necessary, I very much
want to hear it.
If we have to meet to thrash out all these matters, then we should
find time for a meeting.
You are working very hard. I trust you are in good health and
Indu4 is well.

Mahatma Gandhi said that the cow was a great wealth both when living and also after
death. A large part of the population in India is rural and it has to depend much on this
animal for its living. He appreciated the efforts of Chaunde Maharaj and the
Govardhan Society in preserving and developing this great wealth, and added that
more concerted efforts would have to be made all over the country to achieve the
desired object of giving the cow her proper place in the national economy of rural
India.

by post. Spinners should learn to save every pie because it is not theirs
but belongs to the poor. It is only proper that the hanks are handed
over to the bhandar. And it will be all the better if khadi also is sold

I am not sending to Rajani your letter to him. If at all, I can send
it only through Father. He will certainly not like it. I, therefore,
suggest that you should not write to Rajani for the present. If you
permit me, I will write to Rajani and tell him that you do not wish to
write to him or any other old friends for the sake of your father. In
order to prove that it is proper for you not to yield to his original wish
and also in order to give him peace, you must observe this
self-restraint.
 You made a mistake in writing to your friend. A mistake is all
right once. But don’t repeat it. If you write, you should do so either to
me or to Father. That is in your own interest.

293. LETTER TO E. M. JENKINS
October 10, 1945
DEAR SIR EVAN,
I am the Chairman of the All-India Spinners’ Association, a
wholly philanthropic body of about 25 years’ standing, run solely in
the interest of the millions of the poorest unemployed or partly
unemployed women of India. In order further to popularize
hand-spinning a rule was recently introduced at my instance to
demand from the buyers of khadi a certain quantity of yarn in lieu of
money. Since  the inception of the Association,  some time known as
Khadi Board,over four crores have been distributed among spinners all
over India. These include all Communities from among the poor
village women. Now, I understand, licensing rules are being issued by
Provincial Administrations requiring khadi shops to take out licences
as if they were dealers in millmade cloth. Objection has also been
taken to the price being partly demanded in hand-spun yarn. I am
sure the Government do not intend to penalize khadi and thus the
poor people. As this is an all-India matter, I venture to approach His
Excellency in the hope of the impending wrong being redressed. I
may add that the matter has been taken up by the Honorary Secretary

294. LETTER TO JAIRAMDAS DOULATRAM
POONA,
October 10, 1945
MY DEAR JAIRAMDASBHAI,
... I read out the whole of your letter to Bapu. He says that the ban on sending
yarn in large quantities to him was imposed because of the new rules preventing
posting of yarn or cloth from one province to another and also in order to save
postage. He says if you can get over the rules and expense and send the yarn— if
everyone insists on this—to him through someone who happens to be coming his
way you may do so. But he would prefer you to have the yarn woven into cloth and
your proposals which are sound should be adopted. You may send the dhotis, etc., to
him for his personal use when anyone can bring them. In regard to the signatures they
cannot be had for less than Rs. 5 each. Signature money can only go to the Harijan
cause. Khadi auctioned or yarn or cloth donated at the Jayanti, all goes to the A. I. S. A.
I hope I have made Bapu’s wishes clear....
I am not keen on going2 but Bapu feels I should go and take advantage of
doing work by the way so to speak. Bapu is all right again, I am glad to say. Of course
he gets tired easily. But this place admits of good massage and treatment for him as
also more protection from visitors than most others and the climate is better than
[that of] Sevagram in August, September and October. According to present plans he
leaves for Sevagram on the 19th and after 9 days there leaves for Bengal, arriving in
Calcutta on November 2nd. But this depends on what progress Sardar makes this
week. Up till now there is no real improvement in his case but Bapu is hopeful that he
will improve if he stays on....

October 10, 1945
CHI. KISHORELAL,
Today just after the prayers I read with care your article on
decimal coinage. I liked it. Why did you take so long in sending it?
Or did you send it and did I miss it by oversight? I was in Panchgani
then2 and hardly looked at newspapers. At present also the situation is
just the same. To say that I have carefully gone through the article
does not mean that I have also checked up the calculations or that
they are clear to me. Since you are so good at calculations I take it
that the figures are correct. Suppose your figures are correct and your
suggestions are very useful to the public, you cannot sit quiet after
merely writing an article. If your health permits, pursue the matter
yourself or discuss it with Narahari, Jajuji and Kumarappa. Vinoba
also is an expert at figures. If he agrees, Jajuji or Narahari can go deep
into the matter and correspond with Kodanda Rao. I am myself
writing to him. I have written to K. T. Shah3, Vaikunth4 and Gagan-
vihari and sent them copies of the article.
Now about Jajuji. I don’t think we shall gain anything by
sending him to the Assembly. He would become weak. Ours is a queer
way of working and the people working there are even more queer.
People ask for Jajuju and others but will not listen to them after
placing them on the throne. Jajuji will be much more useful by
remaining out of the Assembly.

I am not convinced by what you say about your health. And I
am helpless because you are insisting exclusively on one thing. I
cannot understand your insistence. But since it is backed by your
peculiar line of thinking how can I counter it? If you were
temperamentally like Sardar I would have sent for you for treatment
here or done some such thing. I just do not believe that your
constitution is collapsing from within and that it cannot be helped. I
believe it can be set right by nature cure. I have said all this as I could
not help it. If any of this appeals to you, please let me know so that I
may think about the next step.

CHAUNDE MAHARAJ,
I have your letter. I have expressed my opinion but that does
not mean that a new institution is to be formed for the whole country.
The Goseva Sangh is already there and the work is going on. But the
task is a difficult one. There should be a considerable number of
people who know the science of goseva and can put it into practice.
Your ideas are noble but the work will not progress on mere
ideas. I did not like the scene I witnessed the day I went there.
Everyone was sentimental but they had no knowledge and no will for
work. Try to expand the scope of the goshala. Till now there is no
tannery there. I do not know if there is a good bull.
Do you have a dairy expert? If there is one and if the existing
institution itself becomes an ideal dairy, I shall be too glad and hope
to have great results from it. A similar experiment is going on in
Wardha under my supervision. I cannot of course cite any significant
results. I realize that it is very difficult to attain perfection. I know of
1Dr. Sushila NayyarVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 143no easy way of overcoming difficulties and perhaps I may never come

Your letter makes sad reading. Your sin is grave. You cannot

change of heart on your part. You will have to confess your fall to the
bride. And if she still wishes to marry you, you may do so. You must
give up the bride’s mother. Is she of loose character? I have seen such

I am sending a copy of my letter1 to the Viceroy’s Secretary. I

I am thinking over the legal aspect. I wish to take Dr. Kedar’s

you I am prepared to write to him myself. If you send a brief2 I shall
send the same or shall draw up one. If you are still not satisfied, I shall

us to decide in a hurry. Isn’t it mentioned in the new rule that the date
for implementing it will be announced later? I understand that we

I have read your committee’s amended report. If I have not told
you earlier, let me tell you that as long as we do not get a woman to
head the organization1, it will be like building on sand. Our effort will
bear fruit only if we can find a responsible woman organizer. She
would also keep some kind of record, like your report. Now for
taking any further step, for example choosing the site, I feel the same
thing as I have already indicated should apply. I hope you are all
right.

MY DEAR PINTO,
I have your letter. I take little or no interest in the elections.
Sometimes, however, I have to tender advice. Your letter I like and alsoVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 149dislike. I like its frankness but the argument is bad.1 I want every
minority to be robust and independent in the full sense of the term. A
Christian remains a full Indian because he cannot be otherwise and
expects or wants no reward for remaining an Indian. Then the word
‘minority’ loses all its significance. I have put myself in the
minorities’ position. I can, therefore, speak with frankness and even
some authority. What does it matter, if older Christians cling to the
Government and look up to it for crumbs? That will be the testing
time for the younger ones. For time runs against the former and in
favour of the latter.
If you have understood and appreciated my argument, in your
private talks too you will bear down the opposition of the older ones
by being and remaining true to yourselves and the nation to which
you belong.

BHAI PRAFULLO,
Why did you send a special messenger? Why did you write such
a lengthy note? Rajkumari had shown me what she had written [to
you]. I still find nothing wrong in it. Mahadev would have written a
similar letter. The estrangement between you and Satis Babu hurts me
very much. Perhaps I may not reach there on November 2 because it
might be difficult to leave [ailing] Sardar. In that case I  will be delayed.
The second reason is the election excitement over there.  In view of this
I will fix the date after I hear from you. It will be better to draw up the
programme there itself. Of course it will mean some inconvenience
but it would be better to put up with it.
I hope you are keeping well.

I got your letters. I have already sent a brief message through

I had a discussion with Deo regarding Hindustani. His views are
firm. He adheres to every word of the Poddar-Deo statement. I
showed him the whole of your letter. He finds some factual errors in
it, the chief being that he has never opposed your propagation of
Hindustani. He is not opposed to it even in thought. He has, in fact,
restrained others who were opposed to you. He says that you or others
may offer whatever opposition you wish and in whatever manner you
wish. My path, therefore, is clear. You, I and others who regard
knowledge of the two languages as essentiaI should vigorously, but in
our own manner, carry on our work.
Atulanand’s1 leaflet and other literature have been passed on to
you. Probably his letter also was there. I should like you to read them
and return them to Sevagram with your opinion. My reason for
writing this is that Atulanand has written a letter cautioning me.

332. LETTER TO MRIDULA SARABHAI
October 15, 1945
CHI. MRIDULA,
I have your resignation. I think you have acted wisely in
tendering it. I know and I believe that in accepting the post of Joint
Secretary your intention was to render wider service to the cause of
women. Equally good is your motive in resigning because you
realized and I also saw that by continuing in that post you would not
be able to realize your ideal. There is temperamental incompatibility
between Bapa and you. You tried to adjust but who can remove
inherent differences? You saw that your method of working did not
satisfy Bapa. He, on his part, also tried to adjust but with little success.
I could see that the difference was enormous. In my opinion neither
of you is at fault. Very often such differences are unbridgeable. In
these circumstances, the best thing is to work apart. Bapa was, and is
still, ready to quit. But this is Bapa’s creation and Bapa is a seasoned
hand in this kind of work. It would be difficult for me, I think, to
carry this burden without him. It is Bapa’s wish and mine that all men
should ultimately withdraw from the Samiti and the entire
administration should be handed over to the sisters. That will bring it
real credit. This effort will continue and none of us will rest on our
oars till it succeeds. Success will not come early by Bapa’s leaving it
or allowing us to quit. Hence I am allowing you to quit the Joint
Secretaryship and am accepting your resignation. I know that I am
not losing your services thereby. You are and will continue to be a
1 One who serves158 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHItrustee. I am sure you will continue to work for the local Kasturba
Nidhi committee of Gujarat; and you will also assist the Central
Committee whenever it needs your help. Thus I am confident that you
will not lag behind in serving the Committee even when you
relinquish its Joint Secretaryship. Moreover, you should not forget
that you have resigned from Secretaryship, not from trusteeship.

unsatisfactory. That you are going to Denmark and that during your
1 Vice-President, Harijan Sevak Sangh162 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIabsence the institution will remain closed should have been sufficient
for the withdrawal of the application. Was it good or necessary to
bring in the matter of conversion? When you and Esther came to me,
it was, I think, common between us that conversion from one faith to
another was needless and created heart-burning. One’s faith expands
by removing the bad in it and absorbing the good and new from the
others. You have every right to hold the opposite view. My point is
simple. You had a decisive cause for withdrawing your application
without raising an irrelevant issue.
I hope you will have a good time in Denmark and will return

October 16, 1945
DEAR SISTER,
If you had written your article in ink, I myself would have read
it earlier. But as it was in pencil, I could not read the whole article
1 Son of Kunverji Mehta, a Congressman of Bardoli talukVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 163though there is plenty of light in my room. Ultimately I made
someone read it out. I know from personal experience that there is a
lot of difference between reading something and hearing it read.
Daily I make someone read out cuttings from newspapers and if and
when I have time, I read them myself. Sometimes when a thing is
re-read there is a striking change in my understanding. I feel this must
be a common experience. Of course you have to realize yourself. I
have mentioned this important, though irrelevant, thing because I
thought it worth mentioning. I would be pleased if you accept that
there is violence in writing in pencil things sent by post. The letters
written in pencil fade away in course of time.
I am sending back your article. Please note the changes I have
made in what I could read myself. The changes are just from the point
of view of language. The rest I find is quite all right. I am giving a gist
of my experiences so as to make what I have said more clear.
I saw the work done by teachers trained under Madame
Montessori, and carefully observed the working of the Nursery
School. Of course the things were foreign and the poor teacher had
not digested what she had been taught. What to speak of the children?
They could not even observe normal discipline. I am not criticising
anyone. I have given the gist of my experience just for your
information. Imbibe whatever you find useful and discard the rest.
The conclusion I have drawn from this experience is that we shall be
able to propagate scientific knowledge of child education only when
our teachers are competent. They should have the will to become one
with children. I am afraid I am not saying anything new in this. These
things are certainly not beyond your range of experience but since I
have come to know you and also love you I hope you will not find
fault with me for saying the things you already know.

CHI. MRIDU,
I showed it to Bapa. He returned my draft unchanged. He said:
“I cannot think of making any changes in this. Do what you think
proper. I have learnt about the resignation only today. But do what
you think is correct.” So I am sending my draft as it is with my
signature. But if you wish to make any changes, send it back to me
with the changes. I shall look into the changes and incorporate them if
I find them in order and then send it to the press.
Now about Jog. Bapa says: “I stick to what I said. No one had
sanctioned it. But if you can give the sanction for two months, you
may as well make it for three months so that the matter is settled.” I
would do as you wish. I shall make the sanction for three months if
you so desire. It appears to me that Jog has written under your
persuasion. So I take that what will fully satisfy you will also satisfy
her. I understand that what you suggest is two months’ wages. So I
shall arrange for sanction for only two months. I shall do about the
matter as you want.

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
I have your letter. I remember to have written to you that I
would let you accompany me during some part of my tour.1 My view
is that it would be convenient if you accompanied me in the Madras
Presidency, for I am familiar with the work there. The work in Bengal
and Assam is rather difficult. I don’t have a clear picture of it in my
mind. I, therefore, don’t wish to take with me there anybody who is
not specially needed. The date of my tour also has not been fixed.
Perhaps I may go to Bengal only after November 21. Everything
depends on Sardar’s health.
I think your accepting money from the Rulers requires some
consideration. It was your letter which made me think about this.
Shouldn’t we ponder whether or not we can accept money from
Rulers who pay no attention at all to the welfare of their subjects?
When the amount of Rs. 1,000 is received, I will credit it to the
account of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
So far I have no knowledge of its being received this time. I do
not know if it has been received at the Sevagram Ashram.
Do you think the States would give any protection to the
Harijans wherever they are oppressed? Concerning joint fruitparties
for Harijans and caste Hindus, do you mean any caste Hindus or only
reformers like you and me?
Remind me again when you read about the date of my tour.
Rajkumari has gone to Simla. From there she may perhaps have to go
to England for a month. Sushilabehn and Manilal have gone to
Akola.

2 A similar telegram was sent to Satis Chandra Das Gupta.
3 In the source Sudhir Ghosh explains that Gandhiji drafted this telegram
before he dictated the letter to P. C. Ghosh; vide the following item.170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 359. LETTER TO P. C. GHOSH1
POONA,
October 18, 1945
BHAI PROFULLA,
I have your letter and telegram about Jawaharlalji.2 I have
understood the matter.
Sudhir came yesterday. I have had long talks with Sudhir
yesterday and today. I could not send a telegram about my decision.
It would have been too long. So I am sending this letter. Sudhir must
have sent you a brief telegram.3
Taking everything into consideration I feel that at this stage you
may announce this much: ‘Owing to unavoidable circums-tances
Gandhiji cannot come to Calcutta on the 2nd November. As soon as
the date is decided it will be announced. It is likely that he will come
in the last week of November or thereabouts. His tour programme
which has been published in the newspapers is also cancelled. But
wherever he is likely to go, the organizers will be informed so that
they can make some arrangements. No expen-diture of any kind
should be incurred at this stage. Wherever he goes, his transport will
have to be paid for, but that can be seen at that time only. Gandhiji has
made it clear that, health permitting, he will try his best to go to all the
places he wanted to visit. But consi-dering his age and health, it is
obvious that in spite of his desire to visit as many places as possible he
will be able to visit only a few of them.’
You may publish this much. Now I shall tell you what I want to
do. If possible I want to visit Midnapore, Chittagong, Dacca,
Borkamta, Santiniketan and Assam. If any other place is left out, like
Feni, I would like to visit that also. You can inform the local
organizers about my programme which all of you there may decide
for me. Transport also would have to be arranged. Do not give
anything to the Press yet. That can be done on my arrival. It takes a
little time to make the preliminary arrangements. That is why I have
suggested this. It is for you to work out what places I can easily visit.
I don’t feel that it is necessary for me to let you know just now
1 This was sent through Sudhir Ghosh.
2 The addressee wanted Jawaharlal Nehru to postpone his visit to Calcutta for a
longer visit later.
3 Vide the preceding item.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 171who will be with me. If you want to suggest anything about this, you
may do so.
I would certainly like to meet the people who have already been
to see me. If you want any more persons to meet me you may send
for them. Maulana Saheb is there in Calcutta at present. You should
not trouble him; but if he wants to suggest anything you should go to
him and ask him about it.
I do not want to get involved in addresses of welcome. Gift of
any amount of self-spun yarn, or yarn spun by friends, will not be too
much. My aim will be to convert it into khadi and distribute it there at
the cheapest possible price. Any gift of money will be welcome, but
no special effort should be made for it. It should be voluntary. The
money will  be used for some constructive  work in Bengal. But please
remember  that this tour is not for the collection  of either yarn or
money.
I would of course like to meet Mr. Casey and try to secure from
him whatever assistance can be had for the people. It has been my
experience so far that wherever I go and settle down, my presence
gives the poor and destitute a sense of comfort. If I can do even this
much, I shall be satisfied.
I do not want to get involved in the politics of Bengal. I have
neither the desire nor the knowledge.
Whatever you decide in this matter should be decided
unanimously by all of you, rather than by majority opinion. This is
not the kind of thing which should be settled by the majority. If
anyone interested in my proposed visit does not like a particular thing,
I do not want to do that. There must be no quarrel over my visit. My
dharma is to settle quarrels. Please give this letter or a copy of it to
Satis Babu. My earnest wish is that even though you are two separate
bodies, you should become of one mind before my arrival. You are
both eminent disciples of the same guru, a great guru like P. C. Ray1.
What I want is to see you both truly united in heart. Both of you are
doing my work. Then why should there be any difference between the
two of you? But in all this God’s grace is the main thing.

dharma in the present situation is. You should go and take charge.
The case is a very difficult one. Champa reports that Shashi took him3
to his place, where he behaved sensibly for some time but lost his
balance again. You yourself should ascertain the facts and do what is
necessary. Narandas did all he could. But matters have gone beyond
anybody’s control. There are only two who can exercise some
restraint on him—you or I. I do not belong to any single human
being now. You alone, therefore, can do something.

October 18, 1945
BHAI MANGALDAS PAKVASA,
Many Provincial governments permit the sale of cloth under
licences. They have now amended the terms. A copy of the
amendment introduced by the C. P. Government is enclosed. In my
view a product like khadi cannot be, ought not to be, licensed. A
leading counsel in South Africa with a flourishing practice had told
me that one must proceed on the assumption that every tangible
wrong had a remedy in law and seareh for it, assured that it would be
found. This had appealed to me very much, and I had always relied
on it in my work in South Africa and succeeded in finding the
remedies. I believe the principle is true in India, too. I have not read
all the laws, but I feel that a law which applies to a mill-owner worth
millions cannot apply to khadi.
If you see the definition of a ‘dealer’, you will observe that it
must include ‘business’. There is no trace of ‘business’ in khadi, for
all processes relating to it merely ensure a livelihood to those who
make a living through khadi.
I have alluded to this argument merely as a suggestion to you.
You will also see that the Government is empowered to grant
exemption to anybody. This is not a matter of law, as yet. I draw your
attention to it. You may write to Jajuji for any further information
which you cannot get locally. What I want you to do is this. Consult
anybody whom you wish to and then write to the Government
yourself, or request the counsel whom you consult to do so. If,
however, you feel that whatever representation is to be made should be
addressed by Jajuji as Secretary, we shall do that. Send copies to Jajuji
and me of any correspondence that you have. And if you decide to
write to the Government directly from there, send the letter after
showing the draft to me. I still cherish the belief that I may be able to
suggest some improvements.
We should write immediately to the Provincial Government or to
the Central Government, whichever you decide. I have already
addressed1 a communication to the Central Government as President
of the Charkha Sangh. A copy is enclosed. I have even received an
acknowledgement of the letter. The copy is only for your information
for the present. We do not wish to give publicity to this matter in
1 Vide “Letter to E. M. Jenkins”, 10-10-1945176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHInewspapers just now or let everybody know about it. Probably you
know that by adopting such a procedure I had been able to save the
Charkha Sangh during Linlithgow’s tenure. Let us see what happens
this time.
I am entrusting this important task to you relying on the
assurance you have given to me, that you intend to use your ability
and prestige as a lawyer, not for money but entirely for public service.
And that is what you have been doing for some time. Isn’t that the
best way for everybody to use their talents? If you want any further
information, please write to me. The matter is urgent, since they have
already started issuing licences.
I forgot about one thing. Khadi is facing a special danger,
namely, the U. P. Government’s objection to our practice of
demanding yarn worth some pice from the buyers for khadi worth
every rupee. The objection seems to me ridiculous and harmful from
every point of view. However, please consider along with the other
issue whether such an objection can be sustained in law. In my view
this is a secondary matter and can be easily dealt with. The chief thing
is that khadi must not be considered as falling within the scope of the
licensing law. We have even stores which sell less than 1,000 rupees
worth of khadi every month. To require a licence for sale of khadi is
to put a restraint over the production of khadi, i. e., over the poor.

NATURE CURE CLINIC,

DEAR SIR EVAN,
Shri Jyotish Bose is a condemned prisoner with Shri Haridas
Mitra and others. The condemned prisoner’s father came to me two
1 The letter is placed between those of October 18 and 19, 1945.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 179days ago and showed me his petition for mercy. If Shri Haridas
Mitra’s sentence is commuted, as I hope it will, this one deserves
commutation ipso facto. Shri Jyotish Bose is the son of an
uninfluential poor father. But I am sure that poverty will be
considered no bar to commutation.
I see from the legal papers that there are others of the batch
awaiting execution. The times when the sentences were pronounced
were those of war when calmness was at a discount. Now they are
changed. The war is over. The condemned men have, no matter what
the cause of delay was, survived the war. Will it be too much if I
suggest a reconsideration of all such cases in the shape of
commutation of death sentences? In my opinion, justice to be real
justice requires extension of mercy to temper it.
May I ask you please to put this letter before His Excellency for
consideration?1

MY DEAR KU.,
I have hurriedly gone through the cutting returned herewith.
There is nothing new in it. The reference to Hitler is out of place. It
does not seem to misrepresent my views.
I note what you say about Kishorelal. So your hawk-like eye has
detected an error ! ! !

It gave me joy to have your letter through Sudhir who will tell
you all about my movement.
Of course you and your wife must see me when I come to

Despite your illness, you are following up my suggestions
regarding decimal coinage.3 You will see from Vaikunth’s letter that
though the Government is collecting all literature about it, it will not
start implementing it and meanwhile if suggestions are accepted, it will
at any rate stop for the time being. Of course I am pursuing it.
I have sent to Dr. Zakir a cutting from Dawn.4 Just like you I
also believe that he would not have said what has appeared in the
report. However, we shall await his reply. Sardar also received a
cutting. I have taken that and passed it on to Rajkumari.
The argument about your health will take us nowhere. I think
my heart-ache is also useless but one’s nature does not readily obey
reason. So I stick to my suggestion5. . . .6 It is good you took enema

October 19, 1945
BHAI BHAVANIDAYAL,
I have your letter. I am sorry to learn that you are not well. Get
well soon. This is my hope as well as my wish.
It is surprising that you who know me from childhood should
still fail to understand fully or to make others understand what I am
doing. Truly speaking, good work does not need anyone’s blessings
because it is in itself a blessing. That is to say, its success lies in the
work itself. Secondly, for what shall I send my blessings? There is no
reason to doubt that your aunt may be greater than all the mahatmas
in her field and perhaps she is. Moreover, she is certainly of an
advanced age but it is my misfortune that I don’t know her. In such a
situation how can a man like me send blessings to her? And where do
I count among so many titled men and other bigwigs, and, pray, why
should I? When the rich take my blessings on some occasions you
should take it that I know them and take service from them. Otherwise
none of the rich come to me or can get anything from me. And what
to say of the poor? They are mine and I am theirs. I am myself poor
but if they get my blessings it is not going to appear in the
newspapers. So looking from all points of view, I cannot be a
participant in your aunt’s memorial. Those who are in it do not know
me; so they can only criticize me. What else can they do? If people
like you can convince them with love, you may do so.
 What will you gain by writing to me except that I should waste
my time in writing such long letters and give you the trouble of
reading them even when you are not well? I shall have done my job if
I have been able to make you see the point and if I have not, I am
helpless.

adjust with everyone, who possesses other abilities and is not fit for
anything except legislative work can go to the Assembly. There is no

2 According to the source this was written before the letter to the addressee
dated October 27, 1945. However, Gandhiji’s decision to stay on in Poona till
November 2 was taken around October 19. This letter, therefore, appears to have been
written some time after that.
3 The first three sheets of the letter are damaged.188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIworker is fit for khadi work. One cannot say that therefore he is also
fit for the Assembly work.
Sardar cannot be said to have recovered yet. He has
constipation. He used to spend one and a half to two hours in the
toilet. It may be due to spasm1 in the intestines, or the trouble may be
due to some adhesions2 inside. The pelvic loop3 (of the colon) is much
enlarged. He also feels cramps in the stomach. Dinshawji believes that
the greater part of the complaint he has today will disappear after
three months’ treatment here. He will complete three months on
November 22. He is not accompanying me to Sevagram. According
to the present programme I shall myself go to Sevagram only for
three or four days and then proceed to Bengal. The programme may
be modified. Do write if you have any suggestions about Sardar’s
treatment. I am here at least till November 2nd. I shall stay on till the

I have your and Manilal’s letter.
Arun is very playful. He does not like to study. I see that neither
Abha nor Zohra has any influence on him. Kanu looks after him a
little. Valjibhai teaches him. He has also engaged a man to teach him
tables. I feel now that it would have been better if I had insisted on
your taking him with you. I am no good now for this kind of work. It
might be better to make some arrangement for Arun there.
My plan is hanging fire. It seems that I shall be able to go to
Sevagram after the 15th. I think it will be difficult to leave while
Sardar’s treatment is going on.
It seems Pyarelal has typhoid. He will recover. I am all right. My

with her way of answering or her voice, one can only point out that
you are much older. I don’t remember anything.

The argument that you have put forward has also been shared

make such changes. The best of reforms can be implemented only if
approved by the people. I am also sending Gagan Mehta’s letter to
you. Why should you do typing work? I believe the Talimi Sangh
should do it.
Regarding your health I would like you to come here for
treatment while I am here. But that requires enthusiasm on your part
or detachment like Sardar’s. He has no faith in this system but still he
is giving it a trial.

why I advise you to come here. I will have to stay here for quite some
time. You will feel relieved and will gain some experience since
Sushilabehn is here. Still if you don’t feel like coming, go and spend
some time with Durga and serve her as she needs looking after. I think
your going to Nagpur is futile. Perhaps you will not get peace of
mind there, even if you study there and are with your brother and
sister-in-law. Think over all this and do what you like. What is there to
order you in this? This is a trifling matter.

what he says and if he disagrees, accept his advice. Haven’t I made it
clear in the letter that I have sent through Sudhir that so long as you
all do not decide unanimously and not by majority, it should not be
considered as finally decided? Still, I shall go there and decide which
places I shall visit and which I may not. I have stopped anything being

[Before October 21, 1945 ]1
The meaning of the middle path is this. If you suddenly take a
liking for someone, you will not act on an impulse. If you are used [to
male company] you will not be affected by the sight of a young man.
All men are like a brother or a father to you. If yours is an ideal
mother she will also be a preceptor and guru. She will care for you
and will find a husband for you. If your mother is not an ideal one
any other person whom you have accepted as your mentor will take
full care of you. It is possible you may yourself come across a person
of your liking but that will be due to your previous birth and not
because of a sudden infatuation. Even then you would like to consult
your mother or your mentor and in that case it will not be a secret
matter at all. By “you” here I do not mean “Chand” but . . . .2 This

412. LETTER TO BHULABHAI J. DESAI
POONA,
October 21, 1945
BHAI BHULABHAI1,
As it is difficult to decipher my handwriting, I am dictating this
letter so that it can be written in a clear hand.
Sardar and I keep receiving telegrams suggesting that you
should be put up as a candidate for the Central Legislative Assembly.
I myself have no interest in the elections. A durbar daily assembles
round the Sardar, but I know nothing about it. Ordinarily he does not
talk to me not do I ask him anything. I attend to my work and he
attends to his. The only reason for our being together this time is his
nature-care treatment. He does not have much faith in nature care
while I have. An operation would be a very risky affair. No doctor
except Dr. Deshmukh advises it. That is why he has put faith in me
and is undergoing nature-cure treatment. I have, accordingly, brought
him to Dr. Mehta for I have faith in him. My own knowledge of
nature cure is superficial. I have given this introduction because I
thought it necessary.
If Sardar receives any suggestion regarding you, he puts it
before me. Since you have accepted my advice, I assume that you
yourself are not at all keen o getting into the Central Assembly, and
that, therefore, those who send the telegrams do not do so at your       
1 (1877-1946); Leader of the Congress Party in the Central Assembly;
President, Bombay Provincial Congress Committee; member of Congress Working
Committee198 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIinstance. Some big people naturally desire your presence in the
Assembly. If I were not there, perhaps Sardar would have yielded to
the pressure. But I am firm, for I am acting as your well-wisher. I want
a big service from you, if you can give it. I wish to see you as a
people’s man. I don’t consider you an old man. Why shouldn’t you
also live up to 125? If you do not aspire to live that long, as I do,
please remember that I try to persuade everybody to have such as
piration for the sake of service. And it is not that there is no strength
or effort behind my aspiration. If there is non and my aspiration
proves fruitless, I will accept that. I am not, therefore, afraid of death if
it should come today. But I will cherish my aspiration till my last
breath, for I have to serve —I have not yet finished with service. There
is a spirit of competition to serve which all of us should share.
From this standpoint I suggest to you that you yourself should
issue a graceful statement, thanking all those who are trying on your
behalf, explaining that you do not wish to be a member of the
Assembly at the moment and that you have been doing, and will
continue to do, whatever service you can from outside, that if you live
long enough and feel later that you should also enter the Legislature,
you yourself will come forward and seek people’s votes.
I like the work you are doing just now of defending the
prisoners.1 It will bring you credit. I also wish that like Jawaharlal and
Sardar, and to a great extent Maulana Azad, you too should come into
contact with the masses. Perhaps I should cite Rajendra Babu’s case as
offering the best example. Rajendra Babu is sought after by Bihar, he
himself does not go seeking the support of Bihar. I can cite other
similar instances, too. But where is the need to do so for you? Even
what I have written above seems to me too long, but I cannot restrain
my Moha2. If desire also could be described as sattvika3, I am sure this
desire of mine is that and, therefore, I need not hide it. I trust you are
well and succeeding in your efforts.

POONA,
October 21 , 1945
I have gone through this. I liked it. I would like to go a little
further. Khadi is a symbol of truth and ahimsa. It should not subsist
on the mercy of the Government. It will be a different thing altogether
if khadi is adopted deliberately after its real strength is realized. The
shortage of cloth will then be easily removed. We can even have swaraj
by non-violent means and thereby bring credit to ourselves and to our
Government. Sooner or later that will come but how soon it will come,
depends on the public acceptance of the new plan. I do know that a
time may come when we may even have to suspend the sale of khadi
in our shops. Self-reliance is the only remedy.
From that point of view Jajuji’s article is a preliminary and an
essential move.

CHI. ANANT RAM,
Only today I could finish reading your letter of September 2. It
is good.
Ramanama includes everything. The order is: dharma, artha,
kama and moksha1. Artha cannot be opposed to kama, dharma and
moksha. Hence, artha is food, clothing and other necessities of life;
kama is noble desire. Ramanama transcends time and circumstance—
it has to. And it must issue from the heart, not from the mouth. It
requires persistent effort. Get Asha Devi to write down the Gitanjali2
songs in Bengali and send them to me.
Become good and do lot of service.

Pakistan. I don’t find any depth in the last few chapters. Nor is there

I got your joint letter.
Everyone is concentrating on Arun. Let me see what happens. I
am writing this at night. I have asked him also to write. We have had
rains here recently.
I have told you that my work would always go on. Sushila is a
very good worker. She has taken over all Rajkumari’s work. Kanaiyo
is still here. He quickly disposes of all the lengthy Gujarati letters and
the other special work which I entrust to him. No work here, therefore,
has stopped or presents any difficulty. I take proper sleep and rest. Do
not, therefore, worry about me.
Pyarelal’s fever has come down today. Perhaps it will touch
normal now. Sushila looks after him, but he is being given nature-cure
treatment,
Arun is giving no trouble to anyone. He remains happy. Sumi
has reached Nagpur.

I have your letter. Now have you declared me not guilty? A man
cannot become an inmate of the Ashram just because he appreciates
the elevenfold vow2 or knows all the Shastras and is acquainted with
the constructive programme. But one certainly becomes such by
observing the vows. It seems you have not been able to see that
constructive programme is included in the observance of the vows.
1 This was written on the same sheet as the preceding item.
2 Viz., non-violence, truth, non-stealing, brahmacharya, non-possession,
body-labour, control of the palate, fearlessness on all occasions, equal respect for all
religions, swadeshi and sparshabhavana, that is, refusal to treat anybody as
untouchableVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 203Now go through it again. A person who finds fault with most people,
or with some of them, cannot see his own shortcomings. Don’t make
this mistake.
One becomes a leader not by making mistakes but by getting
rid of one’s shortcomings and imbibing a leader’s qualities.

There should indeed be no indiscipline. And from where can they get
money, etc., if they want to have a maternity centre and other things
without permission? We cannot say anything if they themselves collect
the amount for it. Moreover, haven’t I said that wherever people are
willing to work, we allow them to do so by issuing a circular to that
effect?

Who are we to stop the spread of pure Hindi or pure Urdu?
Even if we try, the attempt is bound to fail. Our duty is to bring
together the two styles of Hindi and Urdu. And this can only happen
when there is a large class of people knowing both the scripts and
both the styles.
It is not very clear what you mean by rashtrabhasha . My
definition is clear enough: only that person who knows both the
scripts and can write in both the styles can be said to be proficient in
rashtrabhasha .

inquiries my son has written to me on 18th October.
Let me tell you that leprosy work is being done through

need be your help will be sought. At the moment I don’t require any.
I must also admit that your letter of 8th September has made me feel

You seem to belong to the Punjab; so you must be knowing

BHAI DASTANE,
I have your postcard. It is not that I have not replied to your
letter owing to lack of time, but since I have something new to say,
there is no need to reply to your other questions. The new thing is that208 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHItill today you have considered public service as primary and have
devoted to the family only whatever time was available after that. Now
having heard everything from Akka1, I feel that you are no longer in a
position to do so. Naturally you have to take care of Akka and also
look after your other daughters and manage their affairs. You have to
support your wife. If you do not, who else will? So it is the duty of
people like you to give primary importance to the family
responsibilities and devote to public service only as much time as you
can after that. One who shoulders the burden of the family as dharma
also renders service. One must clearly distinguish between family
responsibility and family enjoyment. You have long since given up
indulgence. Why should I discuss these things at length? You should
be able to understand them from what I have already said. It should
be clear enough that if you do not abide by what I have said the result
will be quite to the contrary of what it should be.
I cannot say what I had in mind when I wrote “I cannot give”
[answers to your other questions]. And what will you gain by thinking
over it again and again? If I was short of time, I should have said that I
would reply to the other questions some other time. At any rate, I was
quite clear in my mind when I sent a letter2 through Akka that I
should tell you what according to me your dharma was without
bothering you about other things. Now the question arises only if you
are not able to understand and approve of my stand. You can discuss
this letter with Vinoba and Kishorelal. Of course also with Dhotre3 and
other relatives there.

I had a postcard from Chi. Nilkanth yesterday saying that you
wanted Arun to come to you with him. I told Arun about it. Kanu has
the greatest influence over him. He and others also told him. But he
remained stubborn. He says he will come with me. That means all of
you will have to spend the Diwali without him. Put up with his
absence. I am sure you do not wish that I should send him against his
will. With great difficulty he wrote the letter on the back of this last
night. He has no interest at all in study, but has plenty in playing and
cycling. Whatever is possible will have to be done only here. Arun
himself is quite happy. He studies a little, but very little. For all this
backwardness I hold you, his mother, most responsible, since I have
always believed you to be wise. If Arun remains a dullard, I will surely
regard you as stupid.
May you all spend a happy Diwali. Reserve a share for us all in
your happiness. “Us all” includes all of us here and the dumb, poor
millions of India. Those who do not remember them even on the
Diwali day, their Diwali, according to me, is worse than Holi.

BHAI ABHYANKAR,
I have your letter dated the 22nd instant. Your Hindi is not bad
but it may be inadequate to express your thoughts. Mine is also
imperfect but the very idea of writing to Indians in English pains me.
Moreover, I will not agree that you can truly express your thoughts or
feelings in English. Maybe, you think otherwise. But I know that I
would have understood your thoughts better if you had written in
Marathi.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 215I shall not enter into an argument with you. What I have written
to you is right.1 The inquiry is still going on. And I have all [the
papers] as far as the matter has progressed. The day before yesterday
I got the copy of the statement by the father of the child who met with
an untimely death. Now I shall write to you after the inquiry is over.

I had the circular you wanted to issue about the women village
workers I don’t remember now why I did not give then the approval
asked for. I am sorry there has been this delay. I have carefully gone
through it. Do circulate it.
Satyabhama Devi’s donation should be accepted if the Pro-
vincial Committee can make use of it and no burden falls on us. I take
it that the correspondence, etc., will be put in order.
The idea of training midwives through the Kamala Nehru
Hospital2 is good. It is commendable that facilities are made available
by the Hospital. But I have my doubts about the utility of such
midwives as they will not be able to serve in villages. Since our
committee is going to meet now the matter will be decided withoutany
delay. It had, therefore, better be postponed till then. I hope to reach
Wardha on the 21st. Fix a date between that and the 30th, after
consulting Jajuji, and issue a notice3.

that Shri Kamaraj and Shri Bhaktavatsalam used his name to persuade you to stand for
election. He had said nothing of the kind to them. In the company of others they
came to see him and enquire about his health as he was under the same roof as Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel. Dr. Pattabhi who led them pointedly remarked that they had only
come on a friendly visit as they knew he took no interest in elections, and as a matter

elections.

456. LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA
October 26 , 1945
CHI. GHANSHYAMDAS,
I have had Jehangir Patel’s1 letter. He also writes that only the
school building would be suitable. There should be some more
facilities there. There should also be provision for electricity and
water. Dinshaw suggests going straight into the school building when
everything is ready. In that case it will take nine months. I favour
moving at once into the sanatorium building and starting work there,
and later shifting to the school building when it is ready. Whether this
is possible or not has to be decided by you people. In the sanatorium
building also more pipes will be required for water. Maybe, something
will have to be done about electricity too. Water treatment requires
plenty of water. I see some difficulty in taking the school building. If
the school is to be housed there, it will be difficult to run two
institutions in the same building. If my idea takes shape, even the
present building may not be enough. For, my idea is that the poor
also have to be admitted and I shall be interested in running
nature-cure clinics for them, too. It seems to me that from the school
building it would also be possible to serve the village people as I have
planned to do. Think over all this and let me know what you feel
would be best to do.
Let me also give you Sardar’s view. He believes that I should not
1 A Trustee of the Nature Cure Clinic220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIinterest myself in this work to this extent. If Dinshaw requires
financial help I should have it provided to him and then stop at it. In
going further at the moment there is a risk of Dinshaw breaking down
or my being disappointed and the great affection which Dinshaw is
showing for me today coming to an end. I have no such fear. In my
opinion Dinshaw can break down, but his affection for me cannot
wane. I know that he had the same affection for me even when no
question of money was involved and when I did not even know him.
But Sardar understands human nature and he has too much
consideration for me; so I think it is as well to place his view before
you so that you may decide the question objectively.
Please do not think that just because I have been given assurance
about Nasik no other alternative should be considered. Nature-cure
work is of great importance. If carried on well it can have far-reaching
results the scope of which can hardly be envisaged today. It must also
be considered to what extent Dinshaw can fit into this set-up. If you
think it necessary to see me before taking any decision in the matter
and if you can find some time, come and talk it over. But if the matter
can be settled through correspondence, you need not come. In spite
of my great interest in this work you should take it that I am acting in
a detached way. If I am to live for 125 years, there is also this
condition that my sense of objectivity, that is, non-attachment should
increase day by day and approximate as much to perfection as is
humanly possible. I do not know how this can happen or whether it
will happen at all. Why should I even wish to know? Let me keep that
ideal in view and do what I consider to be my duty. I know this much
that it is difficult to reach that ideal. But my life has been spent in
tackling difficult tasks.

Yours about Rajaji. In so far as the people caused any
disturbance neither the Congress nor I had anything to do with them.
There is no doubt that the people resented and rose against the hasty
and wholesale arrests3. The civil disobedience movement could only
be started by me. I never started it. In some cases people lost
self-control. But the Government[’s] senseless violence eclipsed all
popular violence.
To accuse Rajaji of betrayal is not to know him. He is too good
to do anything mean. Of course I have accepted his Formula because
I believe in it.

NATURE CURE CLINIC,
6 TODIWALA ROAD, POONA,
October 27 , 1945
MY DEAR RAMACHANDRA RAO,
Yours of the 13th to hand.
1. Booklet1 on health is still undergoing revision. It was
suspended after my premature discharge from jail and I never had the
time for finishing it. When it is finished you will know of this new
publication. You can certainly publish a translation. It will not be
called a new edition. It will be, if it is ever published, a new thing
altogether.
2. There are many claimants for service of labour.
Unfortunately, Congress monopoly tacitly recognized by all is
broken. But if the Congress is challenged I suppose the Congress will
say we are the only real servants of labour. Who will establish the
claim finally is in the womb of time. My participation in the affairs of
the Working Committee is very slight and, I fancy, growing slighter.
Therefore, don’t expect me to do anything in the matter of the flag
designed by you.
3. SWEEPERS. You and a few others may recognize my claim to be
the first sweeper, but I will cut a sorry figure  in a sweepers’  conference.
The so-called sweepers will themselves repudiate my claim as  many do.
My sympathy  will be with them in such repudiation.  The fortunate
position of a self-styled  man, however, is that he does not require any
outside recognition of a style adopted by himself. Therefore, I must not
bear the burden of having the conference  even when the choice of the
venue is left to me. What is more, I have neither the time nor the wish to
carry more  burdens than I have. You  should therefore go on without
counting on my service even in the way of a message. Cultivate the
belief that every bonafide service carries with it its own recognition.
1 Gandhiji had started writing the  Key to Health on August 27, 1942, during
his incarceration in the Aga Khan Palace and completed it on December 18, 1942. The
Gujarati original was translated into Hindustani and English by Sushila Nayyar under
Gandhiji’s guidance. For Key to Health, vide For Gandhiji’s earlier writings on the
subject written in South Africa, . These were later published in the form of a booklet
under the title A Guide to Health.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 2234. MATERNITY HOME. Are you not principally dependent upon
Government grant and recognition? The record you mention is
certainly very good but it loses in public dignity and value. No Gov-
ernment or Government-aided institution suffers for want of funds.
All are crowded, some even to suffocation. Whether they really serve
the needy poor is a separate question. This criticism is independent of
the fact that I have to ask you to be merciful and excuse me from the
obligation you seek to impose on me. If I do succeed in visiting
Madras for the Hindustani Prachar Sabha, I must ask friends who
know me to extend to me their co-operation by imposing upon
themselves restraint in the way of saving me from further burdens.
5. “UP FROM SLAVERY”: I would love to write a line on this. But
seeing that you have waited all these years I would ask you to wait a
little longer and remind me when I have settled down after the tours I
have in mind.
Yours,

gone. From the empirical view it is only natural that you should
grieve, but if you take the transcendental view, the integral view, what
is there to grieve over in death? What is there to rejoice over in birth?
These two go together, one must follow the other and the two are
inseparably linked. Hence at least to you death should cause no
sorrow. You have an added reason for devoting yourself to your duty.
It is all the more regrettable that you thought of going into the
Assembly at the suggestion of your deceased brother.
About Gadodiaji, if you stick to everything [you have said] write
to me point by point as 1, 2, 3. I am willing to send them to him. I
shall also suggest that they should be placed before an arbitrator.
These should cover all the complaints you had made to me. The
decision about other things may well depend on it, though now I must
confess I have my suspicions.
I cannot write anything about Sardar because he and Dinshawji
are in Bombay. They will return on the 1st. With the elder brother

DEAR MADAM,
I have just received your letter of 20th September, and I have
devoured almost every line of the enclosure to your letter. Miss Slade
whom we know here as Mirabai only, as she desires to be known, is in
a basin of the Himalayas which she adores and loves. It is near
Hardwar, a celebrated place of pilgrimage, through which the mighty
Ganges flows down.
Your Green Cross scheme appeals to me forcibly, not that there
is anything new in it for me. Your resolution is also brief and to the
point, and therefore is a temptation and invitation for me to sign. But I
must resist the temptation. The Green Cross Society will, I hope,
forgive me for the resistance. It will do so readily if it appreciates the
fact that some, among whom I count myself, render greater help by
refraining from signing anything like your resolution but working
silently and probably effectively.
Though I refrain from sending you my signature I will ask you,
if you at all can, to keep me in touch with your activities from time to
time. It may interest and even please you to know that I have enforced
in my own life now for years your ‘ten don’ts’2 andinvited my

the addressee had requested Gandhiji to sign a resolution which was “a
non-controversial, conciliatory plea to protect helpless wild life and unspoilt nature
everywhere”.
2 The Hindu reported: “The Society has put forward ten “don’ts” to prevent
desecration of wild life and nature. It requests the people not to disfigure landscapes or
the general appearance of the village, country road or approach to town by throwing
litter or by displaying advertisements in wrong places or cutting trees and plucking
wild flowers or in any other way. Nor should they disturb the peace of nature which
others are enjoying by shouting, loud singing or playing gramophone records or by

6 TODIWALA ROAD,
POONA,
October 28, 1945
DEAR MASCARENE,
In continuation of the receipt of your resolution, you will not
expect me to express any opinion because just now I have, so far as it
is possible, steeled my heart against any expression of opinion. I have
not studied the question of primary education in Travancore so as to
satisfy myself, and I observe that many persons of note have
expressed emphatic views one way or the other. I do not feel called
upon to say anything.
Why did you drag my sister and her daughter ? My sister is
wholly illiterate. Her daughter can with difficulty read or write
something. But neither takes any interest in public matters. It is fraud
upon the public to put such ignorant persons on the platform and
make them repeat things parrot-like, leading the public to believe that
some good work has been done.
I felt sorry when I first heard that my sister had been dragged
out of her merited obscurity in which she was happy and contented.
She has now come to me being on her way back to Rajkot. She tells
me that she had not the slightest intention of going to a meeting or
sending her daughter. She allowed herself to be tempted to go to
Rameshwaram as a point of pilgrimage. She had intended also to
remain obscure and not let the people know that she was my sister. If
she had asked me I would have dissuaded her even from going to
Rameshwaram, for I have no faith in these pilgrimages except under
certain conditions. But what is done cannot be undone. I would how-
ever like you to give me your version of the story, so that I can have
full facts enabling me to come to a right judgment, for I do not want
to do yo any injustice by making up my mind on insufficient data.
Please therefore enlighten me. And who was the party who wrote out
the speech that my sister’s daughter read without understanding it?

October 28 , 1945
BHAI DAHYALAL,
Don’t be angry with me but have a hearty laugh. I don’t know
who told me or where I read it or what happened but somehow I had
the illusion that you had died. Later one day when I saw Kishorelal
revising your translation of the Gita, I came to know that you were
alive and I was happy about it. But I forgot about this and thought
you were dead. Meanwhile yesterday your letter came and now this
won’t leave my mind. So now you have to live long. But l know that
you may live beyond me, that is, you may live for more than 125
years, and yet will remain what you are now. Isn’t that as good as
being dead even when alive? This is the impression I have got after
reading your letter.
There is nothing new in what you have said about the five
things. Of course, there is some truth in it but according to me it is so
full of ignorance that I have not found any one of them useful. Your
last sentence is: “If there is any service that I can do, do order me.”
How incorrect this sentence is! I did order you to do a lot of service
and what did I get from it? What could the country achieve or what
benefit did you get? Think over the other four things in the same way.
There is no need for a reply and this should not be published on
anyaccount. I have written this just to humour you in the hope that it
may open your eyes one day. If any time you are able to understand
the hidden meaning behind it I would think it is better than getting
your reply and would consider your living meaningful.

BAPA,
I am enclosing Sushila Pai’s letter. Go through it. I wonder if I
have told you about her. If she goes and stays there, most of our
problems can be solved. As I write these lines I recollect that I had
introduced her to you.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 231I think she can be accommodated in Bajajwadi, where your
office is situated. I do not know what facilities are available there. Of
course, we don’t want any overcrowding.
The question of her salary does not arise at the moment. The
thing is we have to see whether we can have her as Joint Secretary with
Sucheta, and whether she can stay in Bajajwadi. We have also to find
out whether Sucheta will agree to have a Joint Secretary. If you appr-
ove of these suggestions, then we shall have to consult Sucheta. If you
concur, I shall refer the matter to her. Please let me have your reply.

there too. For you the places are Almora, Abu or Girnar. Perhaps you
don’t require a library but wish to write on what you already know. If
that is so I shall try. It is quite pleasant near the sea coast but

NATURE CURE CLINIC,

October 29 , 1945
DEAR SIR EVAN,
This I write in fear and trembling, lest I may be overstepping my
limit.
I am watching the progress of the trial of the members of the
corps raised by or under Shri Subhas Babu. Though I can have  nothing
in common with any defence by force of arms, I  am never blind to  the
valour and patriotism  often displayed  by persons in arms, as seems to
be the case here. And can the Government  afford to ignore the almost,
if not the wholly, unanimous  opinion of Indians of all shades of
opinion? India adores these men who are on their trial. No doubt
theGovernment  have overwhelming  might on their side. But it will be
misuse of that power if it is used in the teeth of universal Indian
opposition. It is not for me to say what should be done except that
what is being done is not the way. Let His Excellency decide what is
best in the circumstances.4
Yours sincerely,

NATURE CURE CLINIC,
6 TODIWALA ROAD, POONA,
October 29, 1945
DEAR SIR EVAN,
In continuation of my letter1 of October 10, 1945, about khadi
being licensed, may I add that the Privy Council had to consider the
question of exempting the A.I.S.A. from the income tax. The case is
reported in A. I. R. 1944 Privy Council at p. 88. His Excellency’s
predecessor had at my request ordered that the collection of the tax be
suspended, pending decision of the Privy Council.2 It reversed the
decision of the Bombay High Court and expressed the opinion that
the primary object of the Association is the relief of the poor, that its
objects include the advancement of other purposes of general public
utility and that the making of a commercial or private profit is not the
purpose of the Association. On these grounds they came to the
conclusion that the Association is a charitable and philanthropic body
and entitled to exemption from tax. Can khadi manufactured and sold
on behalf of the manufacturers—the  profits, if any, going to the
hand-spinners  and handloom-weavers—be  classed with mill-cloth
under the Anti-Profiteering  and Hoarding  Regulations?  In my
humbleopinion, it should be wholly exempt from such control, if the
meagre earnings of the poor concerned are not to be taxed.
Yours sincerely,

National Archives of IndiaVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 239490. DRAFT FOR CONGRESS CONSTITUTION
[On or after October 29, 1945 ]1
1. Constructive programme is the chief plank for winning
Swaraj by truthful and non-violent means. Its full execution means
complete independence. But so long as the millions of India do not
take to it, Parliamentary programme will remain as a supplement.
2. The method of enrolment of Congress membership has been
useful and Congress has been able to do a lot of good work. But
many defects have crept in. Therefore, in future the Congress will
consist of workers or servants of the nation only. Any man or woman
above the age of sixteen can become a Congress worker, provided he
or she is a habitual wearer of khadi certified by the A.I.S.A. and pays
a monthly fee of 1,920 rounds of handspun yarn to the Congress. The
spinners should be conversant with all the processes from picking
cotton pods from the field to the point of making slivers and
producing yarn. They should also know how to put a spinning-wheel
in order.
3. The Congress shall make it a point of duty to penetrate the
7,00,000 villages of India. At least one Congress worker shall stay in
each village and do the following:
(a) He shall come in personal contact with every villager and
keep a list of their names along with those of the other members of
their families.
(b) He will enrol and train Congress workers from amongst the
villagers themselves and keep a register of all those who come on the
roll. These shall form the Village Congress Committee.
(c) He shall keep a record of his work from day to day.
(d) It is possible that obstacles might be placed in his way by the
Government or by the villagers themselves. He shall fight all
difficulties by truthful and non-violent action even though he might
perish in the attempt.
(e) He shall organize the villages so as to make them self-
contained and self-supporting through their agriculture and
handicrafts, treating the manufacture of Khadi as the centre, in
accordance with the lines laid down by the A.I.S.A., A.I.V.I.A. and
the Goseva Sangh.
1 From the reference to Gandhiji’s drafting the Constitution of the Congress;
vide “Letter to Kishorelal G. Mashruwala”, 29-10-1945240 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI(f) He shall organize sanitation and hygiene among the villagers
and take all measures for prevention of disease among them.
(g) He shall organize the education of the villagers from birth to
death along the lines of Nayee Talim, in accordance with the policy
laid down by the Hindustani Talimi Sangh.
(h) For the above purposes and others to be added from time to
time by the Congress, he shall train and fit himself for the due
performance of duty, in accordance with the rules laid down by the
Congress for time to time.
4. The Congress shall take part in the elections in all Goverment
managed or controlled institutions, beginning with the Village
Panchayat to the Central Legislative Assembly and Council.
5. The Congress shall contact all those who are on the
Government’s voters’ list, and
(a) will give them an idea of their duties and their rights,
(b) shall produce the necessary literature for their education,
(c) shall make arrangements to impart literacy to the illiterate
amongst them.
(d) shall see that those whose names are missing on the
Government registers are duly entered therein.
(e) shall encourage those who are legally unqualified for the
franchise to acquire the necessary qualifications for getting the right.
(f) shall carry on agitation for adult franchise for all inhabitants
of India who are not proved lunatics or otherwise unfit workers.
6. Out of the existing workers the Congress shall maintain a
Central Board of volunteers whose sole and special duty will be to
reach help to and protect, in accordance with Truth and Non-violence,
the people in cases of rioting, stealing, robbery and like emergencies.
To this end the Congress shall conduct a teaching institution.
7. The Congress shall run a Languages School so as to enable
Congressmen and women to learn the national language (i.e.,
Hindustani spoken by the villagers–Hindus, Muslims and others-in the
villages of the North and written in the Nagari or Urdu script) and
other Indian languages. This work is to be done along the lines of the
Hindustani Prachar Sabha and Bharatiya Bhawan.
8. Representative Village Congress Sabhas being one per not
less than 1000 voters and of workers being one per 1000 workers
shall form the A.I.C.C.
9. The Indian National Congress will comprise:
(1) Village Congress CommitteeVOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 241(2) A.I.C.C.
(3) Working Committee of the Congress
(4) A.I.S.A.
(5) A.I.V.I.A.
(6) Hindustani Talimi Sangh
(7) Institution for Removal of Untouchability
(8) Anti-Intoxicant Association
(9) Labour Union
(10) Kisan Union
10. The A.I.C.C. shall frame rules for smooth working of the
constitution and for matter left unprovided for herein.

491. REFLECTIONS ON CONGRESS CONSTITUTION
[On or after October 29, 1945]1
I am becoming more and more convinced that the four-anna
membership should go. The membership of the Congress should be
forty crores, the whole of the population, no matter to what sect,
religion or province or state or the so-called independent possessions
a particular individual belongs. The members have an equal right with
all to service by the Congress organization. These forty crore
members will exercise no privilege by reason of their recognition as
such by the Congress.
The organization will be worked by those who are habitual
wearers of khaddar one year before the date of commencement, who
have renounced untouchability in all its forms and who are not dealers
in foreign cloth or intoxicants, who have full belief in the constructive
programme of the Congress and who are prepared and willing to do
work referred to in Schedule A hereto and who have passed a
probation period of six months in doing that work.
All Committees and sub-committees shall be formed from the
workers above named.

wish to.” Now we shall think over it when we meet. I have received the
money from Wankaner. I shall send it to you as I received it—in two
instalments and under insured cover.
I understand about Tryambaklal Choksi’s donation. Just now I
am not writing a letter of thanks. I don’t approve of the condition laid
down by him. How can we have a trust for such a small amount? Why
does he not have faith in an institution like the Harijan Sevak Sangh?
And why all this fuss about making a trust? He can give the shares to
Harijan Sevak Sangh on condition that the money received from the
shares will be utilized as decided by the Sangh for the Harijans of
Sorath. I also believe that if we can get more money by selling the246 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIshares, the Sangh should have the right to do so. Think over this and
discuss this with Tryambaklal if you wish to. You can convey to Bapa
my opinion about this. Come to Madras when I reach there.

CHI. SATYADEVI,
I have your letter. I am glad you gave news about the entire
family. If the doctor so advises, get yourself operated upon. There is
no risk at all in an operation. If the complaint is diagnosed as
appendicitis, I do not know of any other treatment.
It is good you have not totally given up the spinning-wheel. All
the same, understand the science of it also. Personally I think that
Dharmakumar should complete his studies.

I have your letter. What you say is right. Yesterday I read it out
to your father’s sister also. I appreciate your writing so frankly about
service-mindedness but I wish to caution you. By following tradition
you will feel the burden of the family all the more and you must
know that sometimes one gets entangled in it. So you will have to
cultivate the spirit of service.

BHAI KHUSHAL SHAH,
I have your English book on the foundation of peace.  As usual I
turned a few pages and tried to look up the index but found none. How
can one do without an index in a  book on a serious subject? You must
find a helper who would prepare  the index. I know you have written
novels, too, and may still be writing  more. I can understand  not having
an index there. But how can one do without one in a book on a
serioussubject? I  hope you are all right. I just saw your letter. I had
written this earlier. How nice it would be if you started writing in
Gujarati or Rashtrabhasha  which millions can understand!

507. LETTER TO MRIDULA SARABHAI
POONA,
October 31, 1945
CHI MRIDULA,
I have your letter. You have laboured very hard. What for ? With
me you could have been brief because I do not any more have to try248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIand understand you. Or do I have to understand you further ? I hope
I can understand from your slightest hint.
There is one thing you must do. What can there be personal with
people like us ? Are you any more an individual ? If you continue to
be an individual, it is not for writing personal things, but to preserve
your individuality, which is done only when you reduce yourself to a
zero and remain a zero. If you do not know this, then follow my
exeprience if you can. Where there is ‘I’, there is individuality. It is
only when ‘I’ is eliminated, that individuality ceases to exist. Take the
letter ‘I’ of the English alphabet. So long as it is straight, it appears
like a scare-crow. If it wants to efface itself and realize its individuality
it must turn itself into a cipher. This is philosophy. But you will see
what I mean.
I can understand your views about Bapa. Our experiences with
him have been different. Only time will show whose experience is
right. I am under no misconception that my experience being longer
is right and your experience being shorter is worng. I know that even
a long experience can be wrong. We shall weigh our experiences on
the scales of time.
Kanu agrees that what I have written to the Kasturba Nidhi about
Bapa is correct, because Thakkar Bapa was instrumental in this. Had
he not involved himself, the matter would not have gone any further.
And Narandas is always clinging to him. He would like to continue to
work through him as before and be satisfied. His idea assumed the
gigantic size it did only after Thakkar Bapa joined in. Afterwards
others too played a major role. That in my opinion is a remarkable
thing about Bapa. He starts something and lets someone else take the
credit. He has shortcomings, no doubt. Who does not have them ? But
in my view, his faults have become insignificant in the face of his
good qualities. I wish you too would recognize this some day.
I am writing to Bapa to pay Lila Jog for three months. Now I
shall be able to find some time to send my letter to the newspapers.

513. A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY1
July 17, 1945
A man of the world can as little comprehend the universe as a
fish living in the ocean can fathom its depths.
July 18, 1945
Not to do evil is the only true law of life, says Guru Teg
July 19, 1945
Life is unreal, death is real and certain. —Nanak
July 20, 1945
Truth can be found by searching within, never through
argument or disputation. It is just the same if for ‘Truth’ one reads
‘God’.
July 21, 1945
Nanak says: “God dwells in every human heart, and so every
heart is a temple of God.”
July 22, 1945
If God resides in every heart, then who dare hate whom?
July 23, 1945
Nanak says: “If we obey the law of God, we then need no
man-made laws.”
July 24, 1945
Nanak says: “God has ordained that all of us in this world itself
are one family and each of us has to live for others,”
July 25, 1945
The darkness of egoism is more impenetrable than darkness itself.
1 At the request of Anand T. Hingorani and to comfort him Gandhiji had started
the practice of writing a thought daily from November 20, 1944252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIJuly 26, 1945
How shall we dispel this darkness of egoism? By the light of
uttermost humility.
July 27, 1945
Sorrow is but another aspect of joy. Hence the one invariably
follows the other.
July 28, 1945
Just as joy and sorrow are a pair that follow each other, in
succession, so is the case with all things in life. Consequently, to have
real peace of mind, we must rise above such pairs of opposites.
July 29, 1945
How can he who realizes not the true value of the Self, nor is
able to protect it, protect anything else in life?
July 30, 1945
Even one word, if true, is enough. Untrue words, however many,
are worth nothing.
July 31, 1945
The power of a true word is such that it leads one from
selfishness to selflessness.
August 1, 1945
He alone lives in whose heart dwells Rama (God) and who is
ever aware of such presence.
August 2, 1945
Real knowledge cannot be acquired by mere reading of the
scriptures. Indeed, it is difficult of attainment without the practice of
virtue.
August 3, 1945
One can never find Truth if one is not wide awake every
moment of one’s life.
August 4, 1945
There can be no such thing as rights for a satyagrahi. For him
there is only one right—the right to serve.
August 5, 1945
Therefore, a satyagrahi will never seek rights; these will come to
him unsought.
August 6, 1945
Even one drop of the poison of untruth will poison the entire
milk-ocean of Truth.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 253August 7, 1945
Nanak says: “Man is born of woman as woman is born of
man.” Then, why is it that we find sexual immorality in the world?
August 8, 1945
Nanak lay in the open under the sky. A kind-hearted
householder suggested to him, “There is a beautiful dharmsala
nearby. Why not go there?” Nanak replied: “The whole earth is my
dharmsala and the sky is its roof.”
 August 9, 1945
Nanak says: “The craving for happiness is a veritable disease.
Sorrow or suffering is its remedy.”
August 10, 1945
Says Nanak again: “Whatever you give away is yours; whatever
you keep is not yours.”
August 11, 1945
Whatever we take, we are snatching from the mouths of others.
Therefore, whenever we acquire anything, let us see that it is really
needed and that our wants are as few as possible.
August 12, 1945
Nanak says: “He who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow
and shares with others what he so earns, can be called truly honest.”
August 13, 1945
Nanak says: “The more one indulges oneself, the more
unhappy one becomes.”
August 14, 1945
St. Catherine of Italy had no money with her. She had only a
cloak which she was wearing. A destitute asked for it and she gave it
away. Someone, thereupon, asked her: “How will you go about
now?” She replied: “The raiment of love will cover me far more
securely than the cloak.”
August 15, 1945
Money alone can keep memory green—how much harm this
false notion has done! This thought occurs to me today on the
anniversary of Mahadev [Desai].
August 16, 1945
Nanak says: “Dreams are evidence of the fact that the atma
(soul) uses the senses as its instruments. But it is only when the atma254 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIkeeps the senses under control that they become its instruments, and
the atma then becomes ripe for union with the Paramatma.”
August 17, 1945
The pangs of hunger are not relieved by filling the stomach.
They can be overcome by taking a limited quantity of food, like
medicine, and remaining content with it.
August 18, 1945
Fear vanishes only with the annihilation of the ego.
August 19, 1945
It is an ordeal nowadays to read the newspapers. They do not
give correct news. Nothing would be lost by not reading them.
August 20, 1945
It is as difficult to make the impossible possible, as it is easy to
make the possible impossible.
August 21, 1945
What seems impossible is not always really so.
August 22, 1945
One person has God on his side; millions have Satan on theirs.
Must, therefore, one fear the millions?
August 23, 1945
Supposing God is on the side of both, then who should fear
whom?
August 24, 1945
He who remembers God can afford to forget everything else.
August 25, 1945
He who remembers everything else but forgets God, really
remembers nothing.
August 26, 1945
He who forgets God, forgets himself.
August 27, 1945
If there is a soul, then surely the Supreme Soul (God), too,
exists.
August 28, 1945
Because of our physical limitations, we cannot have a
conception of the existence of God.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 255August 29, 1945
How can one believe in Truth if one has no belief in
nonviolence? If non-violence is not put into practice, Truth, too,
cannot be.
August 30, 1945
Why would one who is capable of violence for gaining his ends,
hesitate to resort to untruth in both speech and action?
August 31, 1945
There are some things which a man does by word of mouth,
some by observing silence, and yet others by action. If all that he does
is informed with knowledge, it is action indeed.
September 1, 1945
Never should we make the mistake of imagining that a wrong
can be classified as ‘big’ or ‘small’.
September 2, 1945
One man commits a theft, another aids and abets it, while the
third only harbours the intention to commit it. All the three are
thieves.
September 3, 1945
‘What I do is a minor lapse; what others do are major lapses’—
one who thinks like this lives in abysmal ignorance.
September 4, 1945
He who does something wrong out of a false sense of shame is
guilty of a twofold wrong and will not be able to stand up before God.
September 5, 1945
He who thinks, speaks and acts with God as his witness, will
never feel ashamed of doing the right thing.
September 6, 1945
A man who believes whole-heartedly in something, even if it be
absolutely improper, for him it shall be right and proper.
September 7, 1945
He who doubts the existence of God perishes.
September 8, 1945
He who denies the existence of God denies his own.
September 9, 1945
A man who behaves like a beast is worse than the beast;
bestiality is natural for the beast, not so for the man.256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHISeptember 10, 1945
Woman is not helpless. She must never regard herself as weaker
than man. She should not, therefore, beg for any man’s mercy, nor
depend on him.
September 11, 1945
Everyone, prince or pauper, is the guardian of his own dharma.
What is there to grieve or rejoice in this?
September 12, 1945
How strange that a man very often does not know who is a
friend and who is a foe!
September 13, 1945
Belittling one’s mother tongue is like disparaging one’s own
mother.
September 14, 1945
Who can make him take a lower seat who has chosen to sit on
the ground? Likewise, who can make him a servant who has himself
become the servant of all?
September 15, 1945
When a man gives way to anger, he only harms himself. The
truth of this is borne out by daily experience.
September 16, 1945
Life becomes perpetually renewed every day. This knowledge
should be helpful in uplifting us.
September 17, 1945
Happiness eludes us if we run after it. In fact happiness comes
only from within. It is not a commodity to be bought from outside.
September 18, 1945
It is a moot point as to how far a man should go with his
comrades when he knows that they really no longer walk with him in
spirit.
September 19, 1945
He alone can be said to have conquered anger who is not angry
even when there is a cause for anger.
September 20, 1945
Conquest of anger does not mean that anger is not outwardly
manifest while the heart is full of it. Deliberately casting out anger
root and branch, constitutes real conquest.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 257September 21, 1945
Indigestion, etc., are not the only causes of fever. Anger, too, can
bring it on.
September 22, 1945
It is far easier to conquer others than to conquer oneself because
the former can be attained by recourse to outside means while the
latter can be achieved only with one’s own mind.
September 23, 1945
Religion is no religion if it becomes mechanical.
September 24, 1945
Only when religion becomes an integral part of one’s life can it
be called religion. It is not like a garment.
September 25, 1945
‘Money is God’—it is wrong to say so, and it has been proved
to be wrong.
September 26, 1945
Flout one rule and all rules are flouted, for they all have one
basis—breach of any rule is a breach of self-control.
September 27, 1945
All human activity is or should be directed towards the
realization of the self. And in this self-realization lies hidden
God-realization.
September 28, 1945
Man cannot worship God and at the same time despise his
fellow-beings. The two are irreconcilable.
September 29, 1945
Man is truly known by the humility of his spirit.
September 30, 1945
A poet has said that a man without knowledge is like an animal.
What is that knowledge?
October 1 , 1945
Knowledge is that alone which enables a man to know himself.
In other words, knowledge means self-realization.
October 2 , 1945
“Kind and generous though [the man of God] is to the
sorrow-stricken, his mind is not touched with pride.” If it is God who
inspires all our actions, then what place has self-pride?258 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIOctober 3 , 1945
In faith there is no room for despair.
October 4 , 1945
How can that be religion which cannot be put to use in one’s
daily life?
October 5 , 1945
By donning the garb of religion, vice does not become virtue
nor does a wrong cease to be wrong.
October 6 , 1945
“Rather perish than break the pledged word.” —Tulsidas
October 7 , 1945
“There is no sin like untruth, even as a million berries heaped
together cannot equal a mountain”. —Tulsidas
October 8 , 1945
A guru should be perfect. God alone is that.
October 9 , 1945
It is easy to instruct an uneducated person, but who can carry
understanding to a man of little learning?
October 10 , 1945
He who knows no rules and follows none just cannot be a
servant of the people.
October 11 , 1945
One test of non-attachment is that a man, on retiring to bed with
Ramanama on his lips, falls asleep in a moment.
October 12 , 1945
Narasinha Mehta says: “To say ‘I do this’ and ‘I do that’ is the
height of ignorance.” The key to non-attachment lies in the
contemplation of this truth.
October 13 , 1945
It is possible to endure a diseased body, but not a diseased mind.
October 14 , 1945
What greater meanness can there be than to seek out our good
points and praise them to others?
October 15 , 1945
To see nothing but faults of others is even meaner than praising
one’s own virtues.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 -6 DECEMBER, 1945 259October 16 , 1945
The objects of the senses come and go. The point to remember
is that when they leave us, we feel miserable; but when we ourselves
renounce them, we feel happy and joyful.
October 17 , 1945
To mistake selfishness for selflessness is like mistaking a jackal
for a lion.
October 18 , 1945
The saying that “distance lends enchantment to the view” is apt
not only in the case of hills, but also in that of most other things in
life.
October 19 , 1945
Purity is tested only when it is pitted against impurity.
October 20 , 1945
What is true of purity is true of all other virtues. Nonviolence is
tested when it faces violence.
October 21 , 1945
Vice flourishes in darkness. It vanishes in the light of day.
October 22 , 1945
Non-violence, truth, etc., are self-luminous. They cannot be
genuine otherwise.
October 23 , 1945
Justice needs to be tempered with generosity as much as
generosity needs to be tempered with justice.
October 24 , 1945
Only he is worthy to mete out punishment whose judgment is
infallible. Who but God can be such?
October 25 , 1945
To speak or not to speak—when that is the question, silence
should take the place of speech.
October 26 , 1945
Religion does not consist in eating this food or eschewing that
but only in the realization of God within oneself.
October 27 , 1945
Religion is not religion if it expects others to follow it. For
example, the religion of ahimsa (non-violence) can manifest itself
only in the face of himsa (violence).260 THE COLLECTED  WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIOctober 28 , 1945
A Tamil poet says that man’s life is as transient as words
inscribed on water. This needs to be pondered over repeatedly,
October 29 , 1945
Alcohol maddens a man for the moment, but pride devours him
completely and he is not even conscious of it!
October 30 , 1945
Merit lies in fighting alone, be the opponent one or many.
October 31 , 1945
How can he who does not know the art of living know the art of
dying?

BHAI SAHEB,
I have your letter. What more shall I say about your health? The
sooner you go somewhere for rest the better it will be for the country.
You have sent three names for the Working Committee. It will
be better if in this matter you consult the present members and then
announce the names. I have an impression that the Congress will have
to meet some time soon. In that case will it not be better if the
vacancies are filled by fresh elections? But if they have to be filled
now, I think the three names that you have sent are all right. However,
the members will be the best judges.

I have been told that those who take part in prabhatpheri speak
ill of Shri Bhopatkar1. Find out about this. If they speak ill of any
leader try to stop them. What is the good of doing this? I see the harm
clearly. So long as they are in the Congress no one should speak ill of
others.

November 1, 1945
PANDITJI,
I have had your book2 read out to me from beginning to end.
These days while I spin I have a friend read out to me some book
which I think is worth reading. I am disappointed with your book.
From what you had said I had expected that I would learn something
new from it and at the same time some light would be thrown on the
Hindu-Muslim question. Right from my childhood I have lived with
Muslims and when I went to London Providence placed me in close
association with Christians, Muslims and Parsis. Hindus of course were
there. I came into contact with the intellectuals among them and that is
how I read the holy books of all the four religions. I came to the
conclusion that we could know the true facts about any religion only
after reading its sacred books. I also read quite a few criticisms of
them. I can say that I have also read the Muslim critics you mention in
your letter. I had a talk with Muslims in South Africa about those
books and also with an Englishman who had become Muslim. After
coming here I read the works of Maulana Shibli. As a result I have
realized that every religion contains both truth and untruth. The root

the same source, hence all are equal. This equality of all religions has
been included by Vinoba among the eleven vows in a Marathi sloka,
which is daily recited in the prayers.
Non-violence, truth, non-stealing, brahmacharya , non-
possession, body-labour, control of the palate, fearlessness on all
occasions, equal respect for all religions, swadeshi and
sparshabhavana1 these eleven vows should be observed in a spirit of
humility.2
I am trying to live in accordance with this and so are my
associates.
As it is, the letter has become quite long but since you have
taken so much trouble and have also sent to me extra copies of your
book, I felt I should atleast let you know my stand.
I do not wish to argue with you. I have an answer to what you
have suggested but I see no need to give it here. I therefore think that
what I have said is enough.

NATURE CURE CLINIC,
POONA,
November 2, 1945
MY DEAR BHARATAN,
I had your letter yesterday.
You have given a cautious and judicious opinion on Bhailal’s1
project. That is not what I wanted exactly from you. Did I tell you that
I lent him your book2 in typescript, which you gave me to read for my
foreword, and he cock-suredly told me that his scheme was exactly in
conformity with your thesis? I said to him, and I repeat it now, that if I
have understood your thesis correctly, his project is quite contrary to
the letter and the spirit of your thesis. The rule of thumb that I applied
was to know whether his scheme would succeed if it was multiplied to
the extent of covering 700,000 villages. And my answer was it could
not succeed within a measurable distance of time. This fundamental
objection is apart from the fact that he, a tried engineer and therefore
an accurate man, has dared to build his scheme largely on his
calculation that people will do this and that and the other thing will
come true. If what I have said is true and really flows from your book,
as it does from my instinctive belief, you have to say so in black and
white. If my argument is sound, the way to amend your opinion is to
supplement what you have given already by adding that, according to
your book as interpreted by you, the project is bound to fail in terms
of the millions, and is likely to fail even within the limited compass,
because he has built largely upon speculations, a thing which a tried
engineer should never do. Did you also notice that his project
contemplates a mill3 split up into fragments, owned by the villagers or
one intelligent villager? Just think what it means. It must resolve itself
into one gigantic State-owned mill or mills centrally situated. In other
words, 700,000 villages must be converted into 700 or 70 cities. In
still other words, a large portion of the population must die of
starvation, famine and the like or be cut to pieces by the sword or

526. LETTER TO K. M. MUNSHI
November 2, 1945
BHAI MUNSHI,
I think I have told you that I observe silence while spinning. I
do listen, though not to what people say. Valjibhai therefore reads
things to me. In this manner I heard the whole of your speech at the
Hindi Sahitya Sammelan1. I liked what you said regarding my
resignation.2 I was glad, too, that you had firmly expressed your views
regarding the national language. But I feel that what you have said
about writers is not correct. I would let the thing pass if the views
expressed were not harmful. If I have not heard right, please correct
me. I have understood your view to be this: that if a writer can make
his art interesting he has fulfilled himself. It has always seemed to me
a terrible thought that the end of art is for it to be made interesting.
Leaving aside debauchery, even hypocrisy, violence and untruth can
easily be made interesting. Would such writing be called art? On your
recommendation I read Prithivivallabh3. According to me it owes its
popularity not to the interest it sustains but to the meaning it contains.
Besides, you have beautifully blended the beautiful languages
descended from Sanskrit. But, as you have not been able to forget that
history4, can you, as a historian, forget the whole of Muslim history?
Even if you can do so, can you make the whole of India forget it? Can
you reverse the flow of water and make it go upward? After the British

I have placed these two ideas before you with some hesitation,
for I do not regard myself either as an expert on art or as a student of
history. I, however, felt it was my duty to place before you the
experience I have gained as, with my eyes open, I have wandered
around the world. I realize, of course, that the principle which I have
followed in this very letter in welcoming your views regarding the
national language might equally well apply to your ideas on these two
subjects.
I liked your Press statement correcting the article which
appeared in The Chronicle . I had been considering asking you about
it, when I read your reply. What is this confusion regarding
Jawaharlal’s letter? Or is it just a concoction?

527. LETTER TO NARAHARI D. PARIKH
November 2, 1945
CHI. NARAHARI,
Your questions are very good. This much is clear to me: whether
public institutions have members of different religious persuasions or
not, members belonging to the majority communities cannot celebrate
their festivals in a manner which would hurt the religious sentiments
of others. The Ganapati festival, and such others, are entirely of a
political character and have nothing to do with religion. We cannot,
therefore, celebrate them. But celebrations which are part of religious
practice must be observed. For instance, in the Ashram Imam Saheb
used to give, at my instance and request, the call to the faithful and we
used to pray. The call is an essential practice in Islam. It is believed to
be superior to the Church bell of the Christians. I think I have now
answered your question regarding public institutions. If I have left out
any point, please ask again.
It is not easy to answer the question what should be done now
regarding Hindu practices. It is very easy for me to describe what I
myself do. And I am also quite clear in my mind about the
correctness of what I do. But I am not so clear how far the Hindu
community should go or which reforms to advocate even in the face270 THE COLLECTED  WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIof opposition from it. Probably Kishorelal remembers—as I do, if I
am not imagining it—that he had once suggested the omission from
our prayers of the verses referring to Ganapati, Saraswati and the
Earth. I could not accept this. I know that the form of Saraswati
described in the verse is purely imaginary. The Ganapati also is an
imaginary figure and stands merely for “Aum”. But the popular
beliefs about both take the descriptions literally; hence we have the
images of Saraswati and Ganapati. If, therefore, we were to eliminate
all these practices, Hinduism would be transformed into something
quite different; it would, you might say, take the form of the Arya
Samaj. There is much in the Arya Samaj that I love, but I just cannot
accept Satyarthaprakash  as scripture. Dayananda Saraswati was a
great man and he believed in what he preached. He did, therefore,
make an impact. Hinduism, it seems to me, is already assimilating all
that is good in the Arya Samaj, and this is the distinctive feature of
Hinduism. I do not wish to go, or take you, into still deeper waters just
now. If I am destined to live up to 125 years or for many more years
still and if my non-attachment becomes as deep as I wish it to become,
my views will become clearer and firmer and I will also find a
language that appeals to the heart. Till that time arrives, be content
with this prosaic explanation that I have given. I have of course always
expressed, and will continue to express, random views from time to
time as occasion demands. And this will some day lead—if it is so
destined—to perfect clearness. At present my attitude is, neti, neti1.
You may derive what comfort you can from this. I am unhappy that I
am not able to answer your questions as clearly as you have put them.
I have stated my view regarding the Ganapati festival. I will add
this:
1.Wherever there is a Ganapati temple, the arati, etc., should
continue to be performed for the present. There is room for reform in
the arati and the ceremonial. The arati  as it is performed at present is
crude. There is no music in it. It can easily be made musical and sweet
to the ear. The ceremonial also can be made more solemn by
employing a better priest.
2.There is no religion at all in the Dussehra celebration. Its
only sanction is custom. I have always been opposed to it since my
childhood. Even if we wish to equip the people with arms, the
Dussehra celebration has no meaning. Instead of worship of arms, the
people, including even children, should be taught the use of arms, as is
1 “Not this, not this”.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 271done in the West.
3.Plying the charkha on the Charkha Jayanti Day amounts to
ceremonial worship of it. To introduce into it a ritual is to bring the
charkha into disrepute. If you ask me why, when they spin, I permit
them to have a lamp with ghee during broad daylight, my answer will
be that in a large measure it is due to my sense of tolerance, also to
my weakness. I have always opposed the ceremonial worship of the
Gita or the manner in which Gita Jayanti is celebrated at present. I
have also forbidden the composing of a hymn in praise of the Gita to
be recited on the Gita Jayanti Day.
4.I do not approve of any leader’s photograph being
worshipped or of arati being performed in front of it, but I have not
always opposed these things publicly though I did oppose them in my
mind. Since such worship of human beings runs in the blood of
Hindus, I have remained indifferent to them. In this matter I am the
greatest culprit, as it is the worship of my image that has become most
widespread. Since it cannot be prevented, do what I will, I derived a
kind of false consolation when the worship of other leaders also
started. This, of course, does not mitigate my guilt. It is very difficult
to say where this thing will take us. There is some basis of truth in this
practice, namely, that man himself being, in a sense, an image, he will
always remain an image-worshipper. The forms of such worship will
vary for different faiths, but in essence the thing remains image-
worship.
5.You may be sure I am opposed to the practice of inviting
Brahmins and breaking a coconut at a foundation-stone-laying. And
yet I have tolerated this. But since the time I learnt to regard all of us
as belonging to one class, namely, the Atishudras,  all these rituals have
taken a different form in my mind. The new form1 was first put to use
on the occasion of the marriage of Tendulkar and Indu. It is a long
time since then, but I have seen no defect in the practice. On the day
itself the new form seemed very impressive indeed. Vanu2 is getting
along very well. If the clinic3 continues in existence, she will complete
one full year here. She will lose nothing. On the contrary, I believe
she will gain something. I do feel sorry that I am not able to give her
as much attention as I should like to but my preoccupations have
become so serious even here and I have to husband my time so

I have your letter. I must admit that I am disappointed in you.
Prabhudas praised you sky-high. I literally believed him and strongly
recommended to the secretary of the Ashram that you be admitted,
but you did not prove worthy of that praise. You caused anxiety. It
will be good if you have settled down even now. Prabhudas’s mother
is almost an invalid, though she has her wits about her. His father is
bed-ridden. If you had remained there as his daughter how much less
I should have had to worry? As long as you do not cultivate true
devotion to service, as long as you have not controlled your palate and
have not learnt to treat all children as your own, I do not see how you
can do justice to the kindergarten. It is more difficult to run a
kindergarten than to run a school for grown-up children. Very few
realize this. Kindergartens are the vogue these days. ‘What is there in
teaching the children?’ There are many who nurture such ignorance.
I hope you are not a victim of it. This letter is not to dissuade you
from gaining some kindergarten experience but I feel it would be
desirable if you served Kashibehn to supplement your experience.274 THE COLLECTED  WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIShow this letter to Shantabehn. Do what you think right.
Think of the number of mistakes you have made in writing
down a small sloka. Your Devanagari writing is not at all well formed.
What did you expect to gain by citing a sloka like that? How nice it
would have been if you had given the Gujarati meaning of the sloka
provided you had understood it. Your Gujarati handwriting also
invites comment. Even your own signature is not well formed. And
you drag it right to the edge of the paper. The letters are so badly

535. THE CHARKHA SANGH AND POLITICS
A khadi worker has sent the above letter1 to Jajuji, Secretary of
the Charkha Sangh. He has forwarded it to me to discuss it in Khadi
Jagat and to give my opinion on it. The Charkha Sangh is not a small
organization. Even today the workers or the servants—whatever you
call them—of the Sangh are to be found all over India. Their number
is about 3,000. I consider this a small number. Their number should
increase considerably when khadi spreads in the country. Even if we
have one worker for every village, the number of workers on the rolls
of the Charkha Sangh should be 700,000. This requires a lot of
money. But from this one should not conclude that it is impossible to
have so many workers. I have never believed that. When the cause is
good and there is a spirit of service among the workers the money is
always found. I have founded and conducted insitutions all my life. In
my experience there has not been a single institution which was closed
down or which could not make progress for want of money. On the
contrary I have found that some institutions ceased functioning or
could not make progress for want of workers. You should not ask
how, if not on the strength of money, big factories function and
recruitment to the Government offices is made. Those who do not
understand fully what I have said above, raise such doubts. I never
said that money could serve no purpose. If money served no purpose
how could we have become its slaves? I would go to the extent of
saying that without money we cannot go ahead. But what I want to say
is that if we want to become slaves of money we should give up the
1 Not reproduced here.  The correspondent had suggested that workers of the
Charkha Sangh might be permitted to take part in the election activities in their spare
time.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 277idea of serving the people. And it is the lot of slaves to be suppressed.
If however we consider money as our slave and use it as a means and
that too for rendering service, then we are making good use of it. For
the work of service, our first and indispensable need is workers and
when we have such workers money will come chasing them. They will
not have to go in search of money. That is why I say if we get seven
lakh or even more workers we may take it as though we had the
money in the safe. It may be said that we do not pay enough to tempt
or attract workers. I admit it. But it is only the spirit that matters.
Those who join such philanthropic institutions as the Charkha Sangh
do so for the sake of service and not for salaries. They do take
monthly salaries because like the rich the poor too have to feed
themselves, but they do so only to keep themselves alive and fit for
service. Such workers do not eat or drink or dress merely for pleasure.
If we assume that such are the workers of the Charkha Sangh
then they do not have any time to take part in politics. The Charkha
Sangh cannot function at all if the workers devote eight hours to
office work and spend the rest of thetime in pleasure or otherwise.
Because they are the people who will make or mar the Sangh.
Therefore they should devote their spare time to making themselves
more competent for improving its activities, such as learning all the
processes of khadi-making, studying its science, and doing well all
that they do.
This does not mean that the workers of the Charkha Sangh have
no interest in politics or other activities. They are and should be
interested in such activities. However, they should keep that interest in
check and give expression to it through their work in the Charkha
Sangh. Then only can they understand true politics. A Charkha Sangh
worker will remain a true voter and will vote for the candidate put up
by the Congress but he will not bother to canvass for him. He will not
deliver speeches supporting him. He will not devote his time to such
work. Congress work is peoples’ work. The Congress belongs to the
people. The Charkha Sangh has been created by the Congress and the
Charkha Sangh also belongs to the people. Just as political work is
Congress work the Sangh work is also Congress work. How can a man
ride two horses at the same time? One who joins the Charkha Sangh
should devote himself wholly to its activities and one who joins
politics should devote his entire time to politics. In this way both
supplement each other’s work. What I said above is at the back of the278 THE COLLECTED  WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIrule that the workers of Charkha Sangh should not take active part in
politics.

536. LETTER TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH
POONA,
November 3, 1945
CHI. MUNNALAL,
It is not right that you have not written to me at all recently. I
was to reply to your other questions only after I had received your
reply to my suggestion, and that is still so.
Kanchan is on fire. Who else but you can quench that fire? Even
if you released her, she would not marry anybody else. And she is not
one to satisfy her passion through illicit relations with somebody. And
yet passion is burning her up. She does not know the value of
brahmacharya . She has married to gratify her passion. You did not
tell her about the condition of brahmacharya  when marrying her. Is it
not your dharma, now, to satisfy her? If you were completely free
from passion, I would have had nothing to tell you. After giving
Kanchan the gift of children you may observe brahmacharya , or you
should calm her not with anger but with pure love. You should look
after Kishorelal, Gomati, Chhaganlal and Borde, and so also should
Kanchan. Write to me.

I have your letter. I feel sorry for you, and equally sorry for
Munnalal. I have written to him and told him in so many words that
he should set up house with you and that, if the two of you cannotVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 279voluntarily observe self-control, you may have children. However, if
he cannot bring himself to agree to this I cannot force him against his
will. You should, therefore, remain calm. Show this to Munnalal. If he
refuses to change his mind you should leave the matter to God and
engross yourself in work. For the present I should like you, if your
health permits, to look after Gomatibehn, as also the others who are ill.
We shall discuss the question of your accompanying me when I come.
You had wanted to accompany me to Madras. Now you suggest both
Madras and Bengal. That will have to be thought over. We shall do so
when I arrive there. Meanwhile you should remain calm, get well and
serve as much as you can. You are a fine worker. Let service be your
husband, your hobby, your all. But if that cannot be, it does not
matter. In any case do not think one thing and speak another.

542. LETTER TO SUSHILA GANDHI
POONA,
November 4, 1945
CHI. SUSHILA,
I wonder whether you know it, but Kishorelal and Gomati- behn
are getting weaker and weaker. The cold of Sevagram does not suit
them. They shrink from asking for anybody’s services. Gomatibehn
is actually ill. She is suffering from some kind of typhoid. The
constant fever has now come down a little. We trust and hope that it
will come down to normal. But it will take some time for her to leave
the sick-bed, and it will be quite a while before she is able to look after
herself. She would not accept the services of anyone who may offer
them, and if they can help it, neither of them would accept anybody’s
services. I would like it if someone were to stay with them now and
look after them. There is no question as to whether they will like it, for
I have not heard of their having ever complained to anyone about not
getting any service. But wouldn’t my heart complain? If, therefore,
you can get away from there and go to Sevagram, and if your health
permits you to look after them, I think it would be the best
1Vide “Telegram to Jankidevi Bajaj”, 4-11-1945282 THE COLLECTED  WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIarrangement. In that case you will also have to cancel your plan of
accompanying me to Calcutta. I believe it will be February by the time
I finish touring and return to the Ashram. By that time, winter will be
over and we may hope that both of them will have got well. I hope to
reach Sevagram on the 21st. I should like both of you to go to
Sevagram before then. I think it necessary for Manilal to accompany
me on my tour, not to look after me but to gain experience which
might help him in his work and to get to know people. He, therefore,
will not be there all the time. Arun will certainly accompany me to
Sevagram. One cannot say what progress he will make in studies, but I
think he is showing himself to be a good servant. He has taken to
Kanu and, therefore, he is bound to learn to serve. Hence he also will
help. Besides, if both of you agree of your own accord, not for my
sake, to let Arun stay and grow up in the Ashram, as he now says he
would like to do, he will study and also acquire practical wisdom.
Moreover, he has now become friends with Aminbhai, who is a
learned man, and stays in the Ashram. Probably you do not know
him. Manilal is certain to know him. He is an artist like you, but a
much better one. Arun has already started learning from him. And
Aminbhai says that if he were given two years’ time Arun would learn
much more here than he would by joining even the best of schools.
This may perhaps be too optimistic a view. But what difference does it
make to us? It is a fact that his company is bene- ficial. My purpose in
writing all this about Arun is to tell you that he has the spirit of service
in him and that, since he will be with you in the Ashram, you will not
get bored there. Kishorelal and Gomati-behn will thus have the benefit
of your service without any hardship to you. If they feel that you are
likely to suffer in any way by staying there to look after them, they
are not the type who will put up with it. Let me add too that Kashi also
is tired out. She cannot work much now. And Chhaganlal is on
sickbed. He has continuous fever. If it turns out to be as prolonged as
Gomatibehn’s, he also will require to be looked after. I believe,
therefore, that it will be good if you are in the Ashram for his sake at
any rate. I have thus put before you what I believe to be your duty.
Both of you may think over this and do what you consider right. If
your presence there is not essential, both of you should at once leave
for the Ashram. You may write to me from there and tell me what you
intend to do. Ila1 will be with you, of course. But my impression about
1 Addressee’s youngest daughterVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 283her is that she is not likely to be burden on anybody. And, moreover,
she cannot stay without you.

a way you also belong to the Congress. Congress is not an enemy of
the Hindus. It is a different thing if the Congress candidate is bad. In
that case I should like you to tell me. From the newspapers I find that
the Hindu Mahasabha has made it their dharma to oppose Congress
candidates everywhere. If that is so, this action of yours too will be
dharma and not the opposite of it. Sir Radhakrishnan in his speech at
Karachi has given an account of what the members of the Hindu
Mahasabha are doing in Sind. Everyone, and especially you, should
see it. If all that he has said and all that I have been hearing is true, it
will save neither the Hindu dharma nor India. For persons like you it
is very necessary to think over all this. I showed your telegram to
Sardar also. He returned from Bombay last night. He was also pained
to see the telegram.

DEAR SIR EVAN,
A copy of the petition sent to His Excellency on behalf of Shri
Basuda Singh of Fyzabad District has been sent to me for seeking
Government sympathy. From the petition, I gather that it is a case of
political hue, belonging to the 1942 disturbances period. It easily falls
under the principle that guided His Excellency’s decision in the
Ashti-Chimur1 cases. May I therefore ask for the usual commutation
of the death sentence2?
May I also ask for an early consideration of the case by reason
of the fact that the period for execution has been fixed for 19th
instant?

What you say about Sushila Pai is right. It was never my

stays there, whether as a candidate or for examinations, she will be
considered a candidate for the post of organizing secretary. Won’t
she? So the same should hold good in the case of Sushila Pai also. She
also wanted it that way. But I saw that Sucheta did not like it. So if
Sushila Pai goes there it will be just to observe the work and to see if
she can adjust herself in the office. Sucheta is going to let me know
her decision only after seeing you.

I could not write to you yesterday but I kept mulling over
things. You can have anything you like under the Trust, but I would
1 Vide “Letter to Mridula Sarabhai”, 7-1-1945290 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsay that we cannot start anything at Singhgadh right now. It is another
matter if I think of something to start there. The Bombay centre will
have to be closed down. I would advise you to keep it for your own
diversion and as a source of income. I cannot afford to have it under
the Trust. I have still not received the figures about your personal
expenses. If you are provided board and lodging and Rs. 500/- per
month from here, in my view, you should not think of making extra
money from nature cure. But here you must ask your own
conscience. If this is a bitter pill, then you must live in Bombay and
carry on your practice. If you put it in the Trust, it may be closed
down soon after. You do not have to worry at all about the expense
here. I shall manage. I am anticipating that there will not be a single
rich patient left here by the end of December. The facilities here will
solely be for those whom I send.
The person I send to manage things here will stay here. Meat
will be cooked in the kitchen for only Maji and any members of your
family who may be visiting but not for any patient. My dharma tells
me that non-vegetarian food, such as mutton, liver, etc., have no place
in nature cure. I do not suggest that those things have not benefited or
cannot benefit anyone. All I say is that in my view they cannot be
included in nature cure. The entire portion I am occupying at present
will be reserved for you and Gulbai and it should not be necessary at
any time to vacate it even for me. Whenever I come, I can live
anywhere on the upper floor. It will not be difficult for me even to
stay in the room which Saralabehn is at present occupying. If it rains I
can settle in the bathroom. But it is not the least bit fair for me to
occupy the portion especially built for Gulbai.
A ‘stock list’ should be prepared for the Trust. Perhaps it
cannot be done till Bhimnag comes, though of course I have with me
so many people here that I can easily get the stock list and such other
things prepared. But your method of getting work done is altogether
different. I do not like it. That way there are many things that I do not
like, but I put up with them. If you take up the responsibility, most of
the things here can be settled while I am here. I consider it wrong that
you do not get patients to work. Vanamala is capable of doing a lot of
work. All the patients would not be bed-ridden. From now on, only
the poor must be admitted. If there is any rich patient, he will be
brought only by me and he will serve some purpose. I may even take
money from him and he will stay at my pleasure. It irks me that you
have not trained even Gulbai properly. No one here seems to beVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 291getting any training. I do not even see the three-year training being
given here which you thought was necessary. That is not correct. But
in this matter, I have got to be content with whatever you can easily
provide. If you think that thereby the whole thing would completely
change and if it is not proper for me to interfere to such an extent,
you can remove me. If I were to involve myself in the matter, I would
let things continue as they are. I receive letters from people from all
over. They are willing to help in this or even join in. Some of them I
must admit are very good. But till such time as I see you as a votary of
nature cure and know who will be the right people to work with you, I
would not like to admit any nature cure expert. If I run this workshop
I would like to pass on its benefits to the thousands of people outside.
For that, I would naturally need to have a large number of workers.
Only when that happens, can we at last have something like a
university.
Give some thought to this. I have not kept a copy of this letter.
Return it to me after reading. I shall have it copied and then give it
back to you. I have written down my thoughts as they came while I
was still in bed in the morning.

behalf of the Viceroy denied the allegation but promised further examination.
2 Mitra and Jyotish Chandra Bose were sentenced to death under the Enemy
Agents Ordinance for aiding Indian spies landed by a Japanese submarine.  One of the
spies committed suicide.  The other two were tried and sentenced to death along with
their helpers.  All the four of them had petitioned the Viceroy for mercy who
commuted all the four death sentences to transportation for life.296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI568. LETTER TO PRAVIN GANDHI

I am enclosing a cheque for Rs. 375—Lila Jog’s three months’
salary. I am also enclosing the letter Bapa has sent along with the
cheque. This is just for your information. Deliver the cheque to Lila
Jog and send me a receipt. Your work is then over. The purpose of
sending you a copy of Bapa’s letter is that you may know that Bapa is
firm in his views. My reading is that there is some mutual
misunderstanding. It is not that anyone is deliberately lying. What it
means is that there is some purpose in what in English is called “red-
tape”; that is, to get everything in writing so that there can be no
scope for saying something different. Red tape has and does not have
a place among family members. It means that none of them are
bound to one another and that everything is going on smoothly

From where shall I get it? Or you may say there is a difference
between yours and mine. Whichever way we look at it the result is the
same. Let things take their own course. If Kailas is really so timid,
then I feel she should stay with her parents. Let her learn what she can
while serving them. This is just my opinion. Of course I shall be
happy if she studies at the Talimi Sangh and becomes proficient. I
would not like her to serve at the cost of her education. I on my part
believe that pure service is in itself education. This is the basic idea
behind Nayee Talim.2

BHAI RAMARAO,
Even if Panditji has suggested it, why should you ask for a
message1? Even after having been so close to me, don’t you know that
asking for messages really brings harm? I know it is difficult to
understand this, but it should not be difficult for a person like you.
Do men and institutions advance because of praise by others or
because of their own qualities and strength and by adding to these day
by day? Will you not admit that those who depend on others’ praise
progressively become enfeebled?
The sacrifice made by the Herald is genuine, but does sacrifice
need anybody’s praise? And what sacrifice can be made by one who
expects praise?
I hope you will be able to follow my rashtrabhasha . At least
your daughter will be able to explain.

572. LETTER TO NARENDRA DEV
November 7, 1945
BHAI NARENDRA DEV,
I have your letter. There are occasions when one has to write
about those with whom one is very close. The rule to follow is that
people closely associated should not eulogize each other. I can write
much in support of this but what shall I write to a person like you?
Better to spare me from all such things. I am sorry I have not even
seen the daily called Samsar. Even if it comes here, it is not shown to
me because so many editors are kind enough to send me their dailies.
I can say that these days I do not read newspapers at all. Clippings
from newspapers believed to be useful to me are placed before me. If
I send a message to one, why not to the others? Others also do write
and ask for messages.

BHAI VAMANRAO,
I have your beautiful letter. It is interesting too.
I write the truth as I personally see it. Absolute truth alone is
God. It is beyond reach. At the most we can say it is neti, neti1. The
truth that we see is relative, many-sided, plural and is the whole truth
for a given time. There is no scope for vanity in it and the only way of
reaching it is through ahimsa. Pure and absolute truth should be our
ideal. We can reach the ideal only by constantly meditating on it, and
reaching it is attaining moksha. For the last sixty years I have been
experiencing what I have said above. I am still experiencing it.

November 8, 1945
CHI. BACHU,
Your handwriting is particularly bad. It is not worthy of you. In
my view each character of the alphabet is a drawing, and no drawing is
made by scrawling. Whether it is of a mere learner or that of a great
painter the broad outline must look the same to the eye. The drawings
of a parrot made by a learner and an expert artist will look alike in
their general form, but the quality of art in each will reveal who is the
learner and who the expert. Similarly, the shape of “ ” drawn by aVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 301learner and that of one drawn by an expert artist must appear alike.
The difference would be seen only in the quality of art in each. But in
the drawings of your letters there is no resemblance at all. I would
blame your teacher more than you for this. If you have understood
what I have said above and still continue to draw shapeless lines
instead of fine letters, I will blame you. Your body must have now
become as strong as an athlete’s.

not look upon her as your wife and that she also should not look
upon you as her husband. You should accept no service from her.
Indeed, you two should not live in the same place. I am prepared to
arrange for your stay in different places. This would be a painful
duty. But your letter makes it incumbent upon me to take such a step.
As for serving people, you can only tend those of the sick who
require tending.

POONA,

CHI. MADHAVDAS1,
I have your long letter. I cannot say I have read the whole of it,
but Chi. Kanu has told me in substance all that I should know. If
indeed you have settled down as you say you have, I am happy and
Ba’s soul will rejoice wherever it is. I see nothing but her holy merit in
all this love which Kunvarjibhai and others shower on you. They have
become closer to you than your relations by blood. It would,
therefore, be excellent if you so lived as to be of help to one another,
and I would believe that you had had a new birth.
I will write to Kunvarji and Manilal. Please do not feel bad on
account of Manilal and other relations. All of them would be ready to
do their utmost to look after you. If Manilal feels any hesitation in
sending you your keys, please believe me to be the cause behind his
hesitation. I do not possess a pie which I can call my own, and I do
not feel that I have the right to spend any money on your account. I
hold that the brothers should reimburse me whatever expense I have
incurred on you. Manilal is a poor man. I should be a sinner if I let
him earn more from Phoenix than would enable him to live decently.
He, therefore, cannot give you or spend on you much from his
earnings. He probably does not know how close a bond has come to
be formed between Kunvarjibhai and you. Be that as it may, I am
writing to him about the keys.

see your generosity and Ba’s holy merit in the great care you are
1 Brother of Kasturba GandhiVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 303taking of Uncle and in the fact that you are treating him as a respected
elder. If Uncle recovers fully, all the credit will go to you, though
personally I would give part of it to Bhai Krishnavarma. He has, so far,
not asked me even for the expense he has incurred on Uncle and has
nursed him as well as he could for the sake of Ba. Had he not come
forward to help, I would have been at a loss to know where to put
Uncle.
Your idea of helping Uncle run a small store in your neigh-
bourhood is no doubt good, but please do not put it into effect
immediately. After his establishment has been wound up, as you have
suggested, and he has completely forgotten about it and become
perfectly composed, I see no harm in your letting him start a store in
partnership with any member of your family. Let not greed make him
or anyone of you go in for speculation.

I got your letter and postcard. Arun has taken away your letter
and has not returned it. He is always in high spirits these days. He
soon makes friends with everybody who comes here. So I do not now
worry about him. Though he makes no effort, he does learn a little.
There is, therefore, no need for any of you to worry about him just
now.
Please go to Bombay for the books. Maybe you have already
gone there. If you wish, you may certainly pay a flying visit here
before returning. But do not come here for my sake at all, for all my
needs are being properly looked after. So far as I can judge, you need
not come even for the sake of Arun. If, therefore, you come it must be
only for the pleasure of the trip. We will leave for Bombay on the
morning of the 19th. I should advise you to wait for me in Bombay
or, as I have already written, at Sevagram. It is the duty of you two to
serve Kishorelalbhai, Gomatibehn, Chhaganlalbhai and Kashibehn as
much as you can.304 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHITell Ila I have no reason to remember her. She does not keep a
single promise. She had said she would not leave me, but she went
away. And she does not make haste to learn to write so that she can at
least write to me. I hope she will now lose no time to learn to write
letters to me in a beautiful hand.
I think that it would now be better to send Uncle’s keys1 to
Kunvarji Mehta, at Adarsh Dugdhalaya, Malad. He has asked for
them. He has written a long letter. He wishes to sell off his things. He
seems to be well composed in mind at present.
I forgot to ask you to send Uncle’s keys to Kunvarjibhai. Kanu
says I have already written about it above. I have not read it over.

the language of the common people, its vocabulary should mostly consist,
except for words which have religious associations, of Arabic and Persian words
or their derivatives instead of Sanskrit. The seven or eight hundred years of
Hindu-Muslim contact has made Urdu a more common language than Hindi. This
must be the view of everyone who is not biased and is honest and

Kusum is written in quotes: that means it is not your real name.
Why are you so distressed over your widowhood? A true widow does
not believe that because the body of her husband has perished, the
soul has also perished. A woman is married not to a human frame but
to the soul which resides in it. That is precisely the reason why widow
remarriage is taboo. That is why your lamenting, thinking of
committing suicide and so on are contrary to dharma and justice.

I have your letter. The correspondence has been published.1 It is
rather interesting how this came about. On the one hand Bapa writes
to say that I was hasty in getting it published because I had agreed that
we should publish it only after the meeting of the Managing
Committee. How nice it would have been if he had had me put it down
in writing. I myself have no such recollection. Kanu says that he was
present at the time and that I had told Bapa that if something had
happened and if the matter was to be published, the sooner this was
done the better. Well, that is as it may be. Your own recollection is that
I was to give a short statement of my own in the end. I remember
having said something like that but I had not decided on it. Having
considered the whole thing I felt that since my letter22 to you gave the
entire background it was better published. Now if this step was
mistaken how can it be rectified? I don’t see anything wrong in
publishing the facts. I have not seen what has come out in the
newspapers. If you are talking about the English translation, I had
certainly approved it but I do not know if the same has appeared in

She is a woman of great promise. It is possible that she will not like to
join as a clerk. In whatever capacity she comes, it will be only
provisionally. I have not written to her again as I am waiting for
Sucheta’s letter. Please see how the work is to be divided. Spend on
the building only as much as is necessary for providing the
conveniences. I take it that you will not have to get permission for this
from the Managing Committee. I am not going through the rules and
regulations. I have passed on that responsibility to Shamlal. In fact we
should know it by heart. There was a time when I could do that but of
late I have forgotten all about it. I have had to.
I got your letter of today after writing this. Sushila will answer it.

594. LETTER TO SUMITRA GANDHI
November 9, 1945
CHI. SUMI,
I like your letter. You have improved your handwriting a lot.
But your vowel strokes are not always that same. That is a defect. You
make your strokes look like pearl pendants. Nowadays girls have
made this a fashion, but it is a mistake. Strokes should always be
slanting. At the most you can put a dot on top.
I am not at all happy that Rs. 125 was stolen from your pocket
and I am very angry with Nimu. She could have sent the money by
money order. You can always have such dealings with Devdas and
you should.1
Just because I have appreciated your handwriting, don’t think
that there is no room for improvement. You should yourself see and
try to improve it. Take care of your health, physical and mental. Let
me know what you have gained from Nagpur.

I am glad you wrote a postcard to me. I saw Kanu’s handwriting

you start rendering some service to the country. At the present day
that is the dharma for all in India. I am glad you have settled down at
the Bank of Jaipur. Become an expert at your job and stick to the
bank so that in the field of your work you can earn a name for
yourself. I know of two persons who, just like you, began even lower
than clerks and yet reached the top and became famous. Both of them
are no more. They were Gujaratis but it is immaterial whether they
were Gujaratis or not. One is bound to make progress if one sincerely
sticks to something and wishes to acquire mastery in it. May you
make progress in your work and serve the country through it.

BHAI BRELVI,
Your journal carried the report of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan held
at Udaipur. It contains things that Bhai Munshi refutes. The report
says that Pandit Jawaharlal had sent a nice message but that it was
suppressed and was not read out. Bhai Munshi says that he never
received any such message, let alone suppress it. If this is true and
someone gave a false report, he should have signed it.2 Jawaharlal is
there. You could have had a talk with him. I want that there should be
at least one newspaper in India which has only truth from beginning
to end, has no malice and is respected by one and all. Why should not
the Chronicle  which has for its editor, Brelvi, the President of the
Editor’s Conference be such a newspaper?

BAPA,
I have your letter. I had no recollection at all of what you say in
your letter. Now that I think of it I seem to remember we did have a
talk about the matter. There does not seem to be even a hint of it in
our letters. Chi. Kanu says he was present at our talk and that as far as
he can remember you had made the suggestion but I had not accepted
it because postponing publication of the resignation1 would have
served no purpose. If however the President has no right at all to
accept a resignation, then the thing assumes an entirely different
aspect. But the case only supports what I have been saying all along,
namely, that word of mouth should be considered as having no
weight. Only what is written down is true, more so for a person like me
whose memory is dim. So if things are put down in writing it will be a
safeguard for both. You close your letter with “khair”2. Do not go by
it. Take to heart the lesson you learn from this episode. I consider the
episode in itself trivial but it carries significance. It was I who sent a
copy of the resignation to the Press.

621. FOREWORD TO “CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME—ITS
MEANING AND PLACE”
This is a thoroughly revised edition of the Constructive
Programme  which I first wrote in 1941.1 The items included in it have
not been arranged in any order, certainly not in the order of their
importance. When the reader discovers that a particular subject though
important in itself in terms of independence does not find place in the
programme, he should know that the omission is not intentional. He
should unhesitatingly add to my list and let me know. My list does not
pretend to be exhaustive; it is merely illustrative. The reader will see
several new and important additions.
              1 Vide “Constructive Programe” Its Meaning and Place”,13-12-1941VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 325Readers, whether workers and volunteers or not, should
definitely realize that the constructive programme is the truthful and
non-volent way of winning poorna swaraj. Its wholesale fulfilment is
complete independence. Imagine all the forty crores of people
busying themselves with the whole of the constructive programme
which is designed to build up the nation from the very bottom
upward. Can anybody dispute the proposition that it must mean
complete independence in every sense of the expression, including the
ousting of foreign domination? When the critics laugh at the
proposition, what they mean is that forty crores of people will never
co-operate in the effort to fulfil the programme. No doubt, there is
considerable truth in the scoff. My answer is, it is still worth the
attempt. Given an indomitable will on the part of a band of earnest
workers, the programme is as workable as any other and more so than
most. Anyway, I have no substitute for it, if it is to be based on non-
violence.
Civil disobedience, mass or individual, is an aid to constructive
effort and is a full substitute for armed revolt. Training is necessary as
well for civil disobedience as for armed revolt. Only the ways are
different. Action in either case takes place only when occasion
demands. Training for military revolt means learning the use of arms
ending perhaps in the atomic bomb. For civil disobedience it means
the constructive programme.
Therefore, workers will never be on the look-out for civil
resistance. They will hold themselves in readiness, if the constructive
effort is sought to be defeated. From one or two illustrations it will be
seen where it can be and where it cannot be offered. Political pacts we
know have been and can be, but personal friendship with individuals
cannot be, prevented. Such friendships, selfless and genuine, must be
the basis for political pacts. Similarly, centralized khadi can be
defeated by the Government, but no power can defeat individual
manufacture and use of khadi. The manufacture and use of khadi
must not be imposed upon the people, but it must be intelligently and
willingly accepted by them as one of the items of the freedom
movement. This can be done only from the villages as units. Pioneers
even in such programmes can be obstructed. They have had to go
through the fire of suffering throughout the world. There is no swaraj
without suffering. In violence, truth is the first and greatest sufferer; in
non-violence it is ever triumphant. Moreover, men composing the
Government are not to be regarded as enemies. To regard them as
such will be contrary to the non-violent spirit. Part we must, but as
friends.
If this preliminary observation has gone home to the reader, he
will find the constructive programme to be full of deep interest. It326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIshould prove as absorbing as politics so called and platform oratory,
and certainly more important and useful.

622. LETTER TO SIR EVAN M. JENKINS
NATURE CURE CLINIC,
6 TODIWALA  ROAD, POONA,
November 13, 1945
DEAR SIR EVAN,
I have just seen Reuter’s message from London about the
threatened arrest of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.1
I admit that Pandit Nehru’s speeches are hot, if the British rulers
do not want to part with power and hand over to the people what is
theirs. They are not, if the British professions are real. It will be wrong
to attribute hatred or malice to him. He undoubtedly speaks strongly
against the I. C. S. men. But there he speaks the people’s mind. And
he is right. The fine doctrine propounded by His Excellency of
“Forget and Forgive” can only apply to the excesses of a soldiery in
action but surely not to inexusable butchery, inhumanity, bribery,
corruption and the like. If his statements are wrong, they should be
tested through an open and impartial tribunal. If the Government’s
hands are clean they have nothing to fear from publicity.
I will not waste His Excellency’s time by arguing about the
obvious.2
Yours sincerely,
M. K. GANDHI
Gandhiji’s Correspondence with the Government, 1944-47 , p. 57
1 According to a report Sir Maurice Hallett, Governor of U. P., had sought the
Viceroy’s permission to arrest Jawaharlal Nehru.  The Viceroy declining, he had
approached the Secretary of State.  The Viceroy’s House on April 12 issued a Press
Note saying the report was a fabrication.  The Transfer of Power , Vol. VI, p. 481.  It
is now known, however, that Wavell considered the speeches being made by Nehru,
Patel, Pant and other Congress leaders as incitement to violence and was
contemplating “before long ……another violent suppression of Congress”.
Wavell—The Viceroy’s Journal , passim.
2 Writing to Secretary of State Wavell said considering Gandhiji’s “present
state of health…… it is possible that the letter was written by Patel or Nehru and
.merely signed by Gandhi” ! The Transfer of Power , Vol. VI, p. 48.  In his Journal, p.
185, he describes the letter as malevolent.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 327623. LETTER TO SHARDA G. CHOKHAWALA

POONA,
November 13, 1945
CHI. JIVANJI,
I have your letter.
I have been working since the last eight days on the booklet
regarding constructive work. That is to say, I have been giving it every
minute that I can spare from time to time. I finished it two days ago,
but I made so many revisions that I intend to get some portions
rewritten. So that has taken another two days and is likely to take two
more days still. To that extent the pamphlet will become new and
perfect. I could have polished it still further. But is not greed a hill
that lives and grows? It is not inert. Do not believe all that has
appeared in the newspapers regarding Sardar’s biography. I have not
seen the report. When I heard about the plan for presenting a book of
tributes to Sardar, as promised, I put an end to it and suggested that an
authentic biography be written instead. There would be no question of
presenting it to him. I therefore refused to give a message when they
approached me and thus stopped the plan for tributes. It was Munshi2
1 Vide “Letter to Sharda G. Chokhawala”, 6-11-1945
2  K. M. Munshi328 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwho took the lead and I, therefore, suggested that if he took up the
work he would be able to do full justice to it. I have not inquired what
happened or is happening after that. I do not know whether you are
writing the biography or getting it written. You may ask Munshiji
direct. The work is entrusted to Patil and Tendulkar. The letter is to
work as Munshi’s assistant. If, therefore, Munshi has agreed, you
should put together all the material you get and send it to Munshiji. If
he is not going to do the work, ask me again. I had also suggested that
the date for publication of the book should be announced right now
and we should adhere to it.
You may take it that as regards the journals1 I am ready. I do
not now, though, how far I shall be able to cope with the work. But I
think I must do it if the publication can be resumed without difficulty.
You need not flatter anybody. Mavalankar or you may meet the
Magistrate officially and ask him. If he agrees, take out a licence. We
should give no binding, orally or in writing. Only if the Government
also wants the publication of the journals to be resumed may we bring
them out. It would be intolerable if they were to demand a security as
soon as an article appeared. If they are interested in the publications
being resumed, they will have to give us the required paper. After all,
how much would we need? There is no question of advertisements. We
shall have to print a large number of copies. We must print at many as
there is a demand for. I expect that we shall have to print at least as
many as we used to do. Give me full detials. And give me reasonable
time for the first issue. You may, thus, assume that I shall be ready
even if I am touring at the time.

POONA,
November 13, 1945
CHI. JAWAHARLAL,
I was very happy with our talks yesterday. We would not have
discussed more yesterday and it is my view that we shall not be able to
finish our work at a single sitting. We must meet from time to time. I
am so made that if I had the strength to travel about, I would seek you
out, stay with you for a day or two, have some talk and then leave.
Though I am not in a position to do that now, you may know I have
done such things before. I want that people should know us as we
know each other. If in the end we find that our paths are diferent, then
so be it. Our hearts will still remain one, for they are one. The talks we
had yesterday have given me the impression that there is not much
difference in our outlook or the way we understand things. I went to
1  Vaikunthlal L. Mehta330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHItell you how I have understood you. If there is any difference you will
let me know.
(1)The crucial question according to you, is how to ensure
man’s mental, economic, political and moral development. That is my
position too.
(2)And in doing so every inividual should have equal right and
opportunity.
(3)From this point of view there should be equality between
villages and cities. And therefore their food and drink, their way of
life, their dress and their habits should be the same. If such a
condition is to be brought about people should produce their own
cloth and food and build their on houses. So also they should
produce their own water and electricity.
(4)Man is not born to live in the jungle; he is born to live in
society. If we are to make sure that one person does not ride on an
other’s back, the unit should be an ideal village or a social group
which will be self-sufficient, but the members of which will be
interdependent. This conception will bring about a change in human
relationship all over the world.
If I have undertood you correctly up to here, I shall take up the
second part. I have had Rajkumari translate the letter which I wrote to
you earlier. I am getting this also translated and will send the
translation along with this.1 I serve two purposes be getting the letters
translated. First I can explain to you more clearly in English what I
want to say and secondly I shall be able to know better whether I have
understood you fully or not.

You have frankly expressed your views. I like that. I told you I
1  Amrit Kaur’s translation of this is published in A Bunch of Old Letters.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 331would answer your two questions. First, I am not impressed by the
American system. I have regard for their enthusiasm and courage but
at present we cannot proceed on those lines, nor do I wish to do so.
That is why I do not like your new village scheme. My advice is that if
you have the time, go and see our villages and do what you can. Go
and see what my associates, the Kumarappa brothers and the other
three are doing.
I have always liked to keep good relations with America but I
have never liked having an agency there, nor do I like it now. This is
more or less a matter of self-satisfaction if not self-deception. If we
build up strength in India itself, it is bound to have its impact. The
British Government spends lakhs of rupees on spreading falsehood.
Must we imitate their ways to spread truth? I know the clergy in
America do such things. I also know that there is, as there should be, a
lot of difference between propagating truth and propagating untruth.
What more shall I say?

POONA,
November 14, 1945
CHI. DINSHAW,
My cogitations go on. The institution should close down on
December 31. From January 1, it should become an institution for the
poor and cease to be one for the rich. You have so far insisted that the
poor should be taken only after the rich have been accommodated but
those who are really poor can hardly reach you and if anyone reaches
you, they will have to pay the rates the rich pay, which will completely
ruin them. From the 1st January let the rich come after the poor are
accommodated but only if they can live as the poor. The institution
should have more cleanliness than it has today. Money is not
necessary for maintaining cleanliness, but it requires care, love, truth
and knowledge. So it is better that cleaning work is started from today,
but I am afraid it is not possible because no one listens to the others
and everyone is his own master. If anyone takes interest in work, it is
only to please you. Therefore there can be improvement only if
someone from among the people I mentioned above starts working
from today. If this thing does not appeal to you, both of us will have
to repent ultimately because I believe that cleanliness is a part of God.
I would amend the saying “cleanliness is next to godliness” and say
“cleanliness is godliness”. But only if cleanliness is both internal and
external can we call it an attribute of God.
A sign-board should be hung here from January 1. It should be
written in Marathi, Devanagari, Urdu and English. I have not in my
mind formed a precise idea but it would be somewhat as follows.
“The poor are given nature-cure treatment here”.The name
Healthotorium should be removed. There is no need for any name. It
does not befit a poor institution. In fact it does not befit any. The
English would consider it “vulgar”.
We should not use foreign things whether they are patent or not.
The poor cannot afford a bottle of Isapgol pakced in England,
Robinson Barley, Quaker Oats, Sanatogen, Horlicks, malted milk or
Merck’s Glucose. We, from here, cannot teach the people to take these
things—it is immaterial who is here—whether Sardar, some Raja or I.334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIWe must make Sanatogen here. Things similar to Horlicks and malted
milk should be made here and also something like glucose should be
available.
The kitchen can no longer function on the lines it has been
doing so far. Today you have the means to feed even a king. But
those means must be given up tomorrow. The liberality with which
fruit and other things are used here hurts me much. It ought to be
changed. Can’t we manage with jaggery and lemon?
You must develop the habit of writing. Let your Gujarati be
faulty, it can be expressed in good language. Little booklets should be
brought out from here. You will have to pay a lot of attention to all
these things. I do not know how you will be able to do that while
earning 4-5 thousand rupees a month. But bear in mind that if you
cannot do it the University will remain merely a dream. I have a
capacity for boundless work and also for planning. But I do not have
a magic wand by waving which I can create a university. Further, I do
not have the knowledge reuqired for that. Therefore I am helpless. If I
was not helpless I would have started a nature cure clinic of my own,
and would have carried on all my activities from there. But God did
not grant me that. Although I was, and still am, very enthusiastic,
which is why I am clinging on to you, you are a big man and you
have allowed your knowledge to stagnate. That is a big stumbling-
block in your way. Your dream will be realized only if you can get
over it. If your heart bids you that it is not possible, then leave me
even now. I shall not feel bad. Sardar is worried how I am going to
cope with the work. His worry is meaningless because no one compels
me. God impels me to do the work. If He wants to stop the work He
will do so. But you seem to have faith in me, so I must warn you about
my helplessness. And I must let you know the limitations and faults I
find in you. More when something strikes me.

BHAI MANGALDAS,
I have your letter. I see you are working at great speed. I on my
part am doing what I can from here.
I have gone through Motilal’s and your opinion. I agree with it.
But there is one thing neither of you appear to have considered. The
words are: “one should not refuse to sell [khadi] which is worth
buying”. Now the question is which khadi should be considered
“worth buying”. One might say that the khadi which had been
produced according to the conditions laid down by me was “worth
buying”. Isn’t that so? Why can’t I say that I will sell my khadi only
to the person who pays me the highest price for it? This gives rise to
many more questions but I do not wish to discuss them. They are
irrelevant at the moment. But I have been forced to write this becuase
it is not irrelevant to point out the snag which I notice and which
prevents me from publishing your views. So if it can be put right, I
would of course like to get it done, so that it can be published. But if
there is something wrong in my way of thinking, I should not proceed
with it for the moment.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 337I hope to reach there by the morning train on the 19th. Sardar
and others will be with me. I shall leave for Wardha on the 20th
evening.
Now about Munshi. I did not like the article1 you showed me
which appeared in the Chronicle . I found malice in it. Munshi had
come here on business of his own. I asked him about it. He showed
me the mistakes in the article and there were other defects also. Even
if Jawaharlal had sent a message2, Munshi did not get it. Afterwards
Jawaharlal also came and when I asked him he said that he did not
have the slightest recollection of having sent a message. He might
have told somebody to send one but it was of no value. The gist of
this is that there is very little truth in newspapers and they are full of
falsehood. If a man acts believing in their veracity he must lose. I
certainly do not wish to see you lose.

I have carefully gone through your letter. I like it because you

that under the circumstances you should not start work in my absence.
Since you have ordered goods to the value of a thousand rupees, you
should first dispose of them and then wash your hands of the
ointment business. Then when I come that way again I shall, if you are
ready, have you start your work under my supervision. If at the time
you are not prepared for it I shall not hold you responsible.

November 15, 1945
BHAI DASTANE,
What can poor Akka1 or Vatsala22 tell you? All your daughters
are good and wish to give you the minimum trouble. At the same time
they want to take the minimum obligation from others. But I know the
way they depend on you unknowingly. Of course I don’t blame
anyone. Our circumstances often are such that we cannot get out of
them. That is why I advise you that you should take up
grihasthashrama3 and the more you purify it and remain pure
yourself the better will you serve the country. Today we are all
intoxicated. Intoxication is not always due to liquor, ganja or opium.
I have seen that being intoxicated with vanity or the craze for swaraj is
at times worse than the intoxication of liquor. To know our
swadharma and to be engrossed in it is our supreme dharma. That is
why, let me add, I can only discuss things with you but I cannot think
as you do. Do take as much as you can digest from what I say and go
ahead.
I would suggest you have a talk with the members of the
Working Committee. I cannot go very far. My position is like that of a
‘tenant at will’4. The difference is great. I am what I am without any
conscious effort on my part, and the poor tenant at will desires to stay
for ever. I came across a sloka by Bhartrihari, “In fact one who is
attached to sense-objects and one who is free from them are both in
the same position. The latter voluntarily gives up sense-objects and
enjoys bliss, while the self-indulgent one too has to give up his sensual
pleasures every now and then and earns only misery.” Bhartrihari has
crammed a great deal of wisdom into this. Let us all drink that nectar
and attain bliss.

least.
You have used the word ‘stunt’ in a wrong context. You can
translate it as dhating in Gujarati. The changes in diet or other
methods adopted for reducing weight cannot be called stunt. Those
who digest what they have studied keep on pursuing the study in
order to acquire more knowledge without even thinking about the
examination results. While studying they build up their bodies as best
they can because keeping the body healthy, strong and lustrous is also
a part of learning. I give you full encouragement to study what you
have undertaken not for the sake of getting a degree but for the
knowledge that you will acquire while studying for it. Since you have
already studied Gray1 once, it should be a mere child’s play to go
through it a second time. The oftener you read it, the more knowledge
you will gain.
It will be good if you give up the habit of walking about as you
read. It spoils the eyesight and sometimes the thoughts also wander.
While walking one can think over and digest what one has read or
think of the work one has done during the day, and so on. But the
eyes have to look around and take note of the surroundings and watch
out for any obstruction in one’s way. One cannot walk with eyes
closed but a person like me who walks with the support of others
enjoys the pleasure of doing so. But that is not for you.

BHAI ATULANAND,
I have your postcard. I have sent the thing on to a historian who
has also made a serious study of the Hindu-Muslim question. I am
awaiting his reply. A leading Congressman told me that it would not
do any good to write anything like this in the name of the Congress
because the atmosphere was such that people had shut their ears to
objectively expressed views of others and such being the case
anything said was bound to be misunderstood. Therefore, I am not
keen to have this published. Seeing the atmosphere that prevails I
myself hold a similar view. But lest I do injustice to your endeavour I
have sent it to a historian for his opinion. This much I can say that it
will not be possible to have it published as quickly as you want. Let us
see what comes of it and what I finally decide.
My visit to Bengal will not be long in coming now. I hope to
reach there on December 1st. Do meet me there. Let me, however, tell
you that the final decision lies not with those with an English
education but with the millions of people who know their mother
tongue or the national language. Therefore, write the original in your
mother tongue, Bengali; and for other provinces in the national
language in both the scripts. If you agree with what I say, start reading
and writing the national language in both the scripts. Would Rabi
Babu’s writings and poetry have had any impact on Bengali if he had
written in English?

BHAI VYASATIRTH,
I have your letter. You must be aware that ordinary marriages
no longer have any interest for me. I am interested, if at all, in a caste
Hindu marrying a Harijan. For, if we wish to observeVarnashrama
dharma, we should all belong to one caste, i.e., of Harijans. And how
else can we prove that we have really become Harijans? But what if
marriage between a Bhangi and a Brahmin is not for observing
dharma but for indulgence? All the same you have my blessings if
your marriage is for the service of the poeple and if both of you live a
life of self-restraint.

November 17, 1945
DEAR SISTER,
I can see your love in everything you do, but you must temper
your love with reason. Yesterday I could not go where I intended to
go, could not do what I intended to do. I only watched the tamasha1.
Such things give me a fright. I am also past the age when they could
interest me. I had intended to inspect all the living quarters and
latrines in the sanatorium and to offer suggestions. I had intended to
talk to the doctors and joke with the patients. I have to say none of
this was done. I had especially brought along Nargisbehn. She could
not see anything. I would not take her to watch a tamasha at any time.
Impelled by your love I spared three hours out of a busy schedule.
These days it is not an easy thing for me to spare three hours. They
are not mine, they belong to the people. And you should not be
instrumental in my wasting even a minute. Now do this much. I want

out of it was spent on the septic tank. If you can easily procure a plan
of the hut and the septic tank, I would like to have it. The septic tank
is a good device. There was some rank grass around and it seems
valuable water, containing manure, flowing from the tank is going
waste. Something had better be done about it. What things do they
make at the glass factory?

CHI. JIVANJI,
Please read the enclosed letter and return it to me with your
opinion on what should be done. They have sent the money as royalty
on the sales of the translation, but since we are not entitled to it I feel
tempted to utilize it for the many other activities under my charge
instead of crediting it to the Navajivan account. But then I also feel
that I had better send it to you. I am, therefore, sending the cheque
herewith. If, now, you yourself feel that the money should not be
credited to the Navajivan account, then, and only then, return it to me.
At present I am spending money as it comes from different accounts.
I do not see any of these to be specially in need of this money. Hence
both of us can consider the matter objectively.
I sent you yesterday the pamphlet on constructive programme
after revising it with great labour. Inadvertently, it was posted as
unregistered packet. I shall, therefore, feel worried till I get an
acknowledgment from you. For I have kept no copy of it. But I derive
what comfort I can from the story of Newton who, after being slightly
upset when the manuscript on which he had been working for many
years was destroyed in a fire by somebody, proceeded to write it all
over again. And with this thought I keep patience. I hope it will not be
lost on the way. But if it is, I will revise another copy. It will mean loss
of some time, of course. If, therefore, you receive it safely, spend
money on a wire, but if you don’t get it send another copy with your
suggestions so that I may start work on it immediately.

I thought I did not have to give you any reply. But that is all
right. I am replying now.
1. I regard Prakash as my daughter. There was no idea of pleasing
anybody in allowing her to touch me. I decided that she should
remain with me while I stayed in Calcutta and then should accompany
me to Santiniketan, nowhere else. I still think the same today. Let her
come to Calcutta. Then we shall see what happens.
2. I shall arrange Rs. 25/- a month to be sent to you if you so wish.
3. I do not see any need for Sushila to write to Manu. However, if
Sushila herself feels that she should send the letter, or another letter,
she is free to do so. I am firmly of opinion that it is in her interest and
in the interest of everyone that among the three of us only I should
correspond with her. I do not think it is necessary to send either of the
books to Manu now. But I shall let her know that you have given me
the books to be sent to her. I shall do as she desires. That would be
best. I feel that it would be somewhat rude to send her the books just
like that.
Now that I am writing, let me state that I had understood your
wish that I should not use for you terms like ‘poet’ and so on. You
did not know the full context. Still, I shall be as cautious as I can be.
But habits die hard !

CHI. GHANSHYAMDAS,
I have no doubt that you have done everything possible with
regard to the land at Nasik. Dinshaw is an eccentric man but he is very
good, generous and simple-hearted. In the matter of nature cure he is
the only man on whom my eyes are fixed. I shall go on encouraging
him in his virtues and, if I can do so, it will be of much help to the
patients. Therefore, when I saw that he was himself not keen on going
to Nasik, I dropped the matter. With that I also decided to begin the
new term of the institution from here and run it for the poor. So far
only the rich have come and the poor have remained behind. But now
the rich who wish to be admitted here will have to come after the poor.
The rich will get the same facilities as the poor. At the same time it is
certain that an attempt will be made to observe the rules of cleanliness
as meticulously as possible. No doubt it is a difficult task. I should not
cultivate such an interest in my declining years. But what lay dormant
for years has awakened without any effort on my part. How can I
resist it? God’s will alone will prevail. For the time being the insti-
tution of which you too are a trustee has been closed. If it is to come
into existence out of the activities here, it will. Whatever happens will
be proper from all points of view. I shall write to you if I have to go to
Nasik or need money to carry on this institution. At present I am just
watching. There is some money lying with me. I shall manage with it.
Since it is the condition of this trust that the management will not be
left in Dinshaw’s hands, you may as well say that the responsibility
will mine.
I have read Shivnath Singh’s letter you sent me. It did not make
a favourable impression on me. He has written at great length1. I am
writing a brief note to him.

for 3 p. m. It is true that I told those who had come to see me that if

the condition you have laid down. I cannot speak on behalf of the

my view to you that though you have taken great pains in drafting the
constitution, it is not workable and it cannot appeal to others. I still
think as I have said earlier, that only if all the communities are first
united at heart and wish to sit together and decide the issue will it be
possible to frame a constitution. So what the Congress will do is beside
the point. Personally, too, I cannot agree with you on your
constitution. As I have said, though there are some good features in it
and I appreciate the trouble you have taken, I am afraid we shall not

668. DISCUSSION WITH HINDUSTANI PRACHAR SABHA
WORKERS
BOMBAY,
[Novemeber 19, 1945 ]1
To a questions why the Urdu script should be imposed on a person who did not
like it and wished to learn the national language only through the Devanagari script,
Mahatma Gandhi replied:
It is not a question of liking or disliking. If you do not like the
Urdu script, then I conclude that you do not like Hindustani. The
Urdu script must be learnt. Without effort and sacrifice we cannot
dream of winning freedom. So far as the provinces of Bombay,
Gujarat and Maharashtra are concerned, the question of learning the
Nagari script does not arise at all as everybody knows it already. Then,
where does Hindustani Prachar come in? In learning the other script,
do not think you are conferring a favour on anyone. It should be
considered as your duty. It is a national work and everyone should do
it. By learning both the scripts you can better understand both the
Hindi and the Urdu developments of the language. I can understand
Sanskritized Hindi, but what about the masses? It is our duty to learn
both the scripts. Then alone can we hoenstly serve the country in a
humble way. According to me one who does not have a liking for the
Urdu script has no liking for swaraj also. The masses do not
understand pure Hindi or pure Urdu, so Hindustani should be evolved
in such a way that even the illiterate masses can understand it.
Mere slogans would not help in achieving the goal of freedom.
Taking as little trouble as possible and looking to your worldly
advancement will leave your swaraj just a dream. Nagari and Urdu are
1 From The Bombay Chronicle,  25-11-1945358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIboth equally dear to me. So when I say learn the Urdu script I have no
enmity towards the other script. Our swaraj cannot be given to us as a
gift, but we shall have to win it through our untiring efforts.
To understand our people and win swaraj for our country, do
not be deterred from this small effort of learning the two important
scripts of our land. To keep faith, one must be cent per cent faithful.
It is not a bit of bread which you can break up in pieces. The
language of a people cannot be divided, it is one and indivisible like
Truth. Therefore, whether you like it or not you will have to learn and
love Urdu.
Asked whether script should be given as much importance as language,
Gandhiji replied:
Language and script are both necessary in practice. How are we,
after all, to solve the question of writing to our own Muslim brethren
who know only the other script? If we argue, ‘What have we to do with
them?’, then I say why bother about swaraj? I want to learn all the
thirteen scripts and want to know them equally well. Had you given
one-seventh of the time to the learning of these scripts which you have
given to English, you would have learnt all the thirteen scripts by now.
It is not difficult to learn the Urdu script. It can be done with great
ease and facility.
A pracharak  asked why the Urdu script should not be taught to the student after
the Nagari is learnt. Mahatma said:
If I had been a teacher, I would have taught four or five scripts
at the same time. I did not take even eight days to learn the Urdu
script. There should at least be four or five such teachers who may
know the two script perfectly and may be able to teach them. It could
be left to the option of the teacher whether he taught the two scripts
together or one after the other. But he should examine them in both
before giving them a certificate.
Regarding the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and Babu Purushottam Das Tandon’s
attitude to the script issue, Mahatma Gandhi said:
Tandonji is my friend. I love him. We have lived together for a
long time. But now, on this question, we are taking two different paths;
but we do not stand in each other’s way. Personally, for myself, I want
to see Saraswati after the union of Ganga and Jamuna.

told you was never meant for the Press and so far as I am concerned I
would like to say that whatever we have been writing to each other
should not be sent to the Press. Still, you can send it if you think it fit.
Excuse me for not replying in English. You think that if we write in

write in English it can mean one thing only. But I hold exactly the
opposite view.

670. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDHA,
November 21, 1945
I had purposely refrained from correcting or contradicting
reports about my shifting to Poona and establishing a nature cure
hospital on an extensive plot of ground in Poona or even Nasik. All
this was wrong, as most unauthentic reports in the Press are. These
have always cost me dear, perhaps the public more than me. There
was, however, a grain of truth in the ounce of rumour. Dr. Dinshaw
Mehta knew me before I knew him and, ever since I have known him,
I have liked him. I have been myself a nature cure man before all
known to me. Of them, Dr. Dinshaw has made the greatest impression
on me and he is a dreamer like me. He wants a nature cure university;
so do I. He has made over to a Trust his concerns at Poona and
Sinhgad. Their nominal cost, according to the schedules to the Trust,
is, in round figures, Rs. 50,000. I have allowed myself to be one of the
Trustees. The other two are Dr. Mehta himself and Mr. Jehangir Patel
who is interested in nature cure. Hitherto Dr. Mehta’s institution has
been meant for monied men and then for as many poor people as he
could safely take. Patients have all been residential.
From the 1st of January next, this institution will be devoted to360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthe service of the poor. The rich will be taken only if they can
accommodate themselves to remain with the poor, and expect no more
space or comforts than the poor will get at this institution. The
guarantee will be that the standard of cleanliness, shorn of luxury, will
be the highest attainable in any institution of the kind. Treatment will
be both indoor and outdoor. Outdoor will naturally be more than
indoor.
The Birlas have interested themselves in me for years. And they
were prepared to give me in Nasik as much land with buildings as
were required for the institution. But Dr. Dinshaw was not whole-
heartedly inclined to favour the Nasik idea, unless I consented to
include in the Trust the going concerns at Poona too. I could not
shoulder the burden. Hence the Nasik project had to be dropped, for
the time being at any rate.1 Dr. Dinshaw will still remain the sole
Director so far as the technical part is concerned. This institution, if it
is to grow at all, will require the silent blessings of the poor, the
financial support of the rich, active co-operation of genuine
naturopaths of India and sympathy of the medical fraternity. Its
present site is too small for the requirements of the poor. Moreover, it
will largely depend upon the leaseholder whether the institution can in
any case remain located on the present site.

CHI. CHANDRASHANKAR,
Just now as I start writing, your letter is placed before me. Of
course I do get news of you. And when the Sardar is there what more
can one want? I have secured the books you recommended. I do want
to glance through them but what am I to do? Please send Joad’s  book
when you come across it. Also Hodge’s1 . I understand about your
health but I am glad that you are able somehow to carry on your
work. Reading your letter for a moment I wondered if it was
Mahadev’s. You and a few others have been copying his handwriting
but you beat all the rest.

674. LETTER TO KAMALNAYAN BAJAJ
SEVAGRAM ,
November 22, 1945
CHI. KAMALNAYAN,
Since you will certainly not be back before I leave Sevagram, I
am writing you this letter. You should know that the Nagpur Bank was
Jamanalal’s, which he had started for the service of the people. The
1 Charles Hodge362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIidea was, and ought to be even now, that it should serve as a savings
bank for the poor. The bank, therefore, must never crash. In other
words, the Nagpur Bank should crash only when the Bank of England
or the Imperial Bank do or when there is some great natural calamity.
That is, it must have the reputation that it will be the last not the first to
crash. That you are Jamnalal’s heir really means that you are heir to
that reputation, and it was because of this belief of mine that I advised
the Jallianwala Trust to let its funds remain in the Nagpur Bank and to
try to transfer still more deposits to it. I have given the same advice to
Kumarappa, nemely, that he should deposit the Village Industries
Association’s funds in that Bank. That confidence must not prove to
have been misplaced. But the moment I alighted at the railway station
yesterday Bharatan told me quite the opposite. He of course spoke
gently and since I am the President of the Association, asked for my
opinion. Kumarappa had written to me and asked me whether he
should deposit the Village Industries funds in the . . . .1 Bank.
Vaikunthbhai had advised in favour of it and, therefore, Kumarappa
had assumed that I also would agree. But I expressed doubt and did
not give my consent. Kumarappa, however, had already deposited the
money. But now we must withdraw it. In that case we shall lose the
interest. And what if, despite our readiness to lose the interest, we
cannot withdraw it. So Bharatan asked my advice. Kumarappa, is not
here just now. But I told Bharatan that if the Bank people objected, we
must put up a fight and insist on withdrawing the money, for
otherwise I felt the money was insecure and it would be like killing a
buffalo for a leather thong. I do not know even today what kind of an
establishment the . . . Bank is. I do have some vague idea about it, of
course. But I generally dislike and distrust new banks. I would not,
therefore, readily agree to deposit money in them. Then the question
arose: if not in the . . . Bank, why should we keep the money in the
Nagpur Bank? Is it also not a comparatively new bank? Comparatively
yes. Bharatan then added that it was being rumoured that the Nagpur
Bank would close down in a month or two because it had incurred
losses and it was feared that the deposits were not safe. He suggested,
therefore, that it would be wise to withdraw the money in time. I did
not believe the rumour and remained undisturbed in my mind, but I
wanted to know what was at the back of the rumour. Radhakrishna was
with me at the time. I asked him. He explained the position. I felt
reassured and told Bharatan that we must deposit the money in the
Nagpur Bank and nowhere else. However, I felt that I must inform
you. Hence this letter. Think over this and be on your guard. It is no
1 Addressee’s cousin, Radhakrishna BajajVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 363ordinary matter to be Jamnalal’s heir. You are his heir because you
are his son. I am his heir because I am his adopted father. My interest
is to see that his name remains untarnished. You and I shall have
proved ourselves his true heirs only if the ventures he started are not
merely kept up but become models of their kind.
It may be that you will earn a lot of money and be reckoned a
millionaire. But what is to happen to the philanthropic ventures and
the Bank he started in the last years of his life? What is to happen to
the cause of the poor cow, of khadi, of the Village Industries
Association? Did I not settle at Wardha at his behest, ignoring Sardar’s
anger born out of his love? He could have easily secured for me ten
orchards against one here, but he could not find for me a Jamnalal
there and, therefore, I let go the ten orchards. And now, I do not wish
even to feel that I have lost Jamnalal. This rests entirely in your hands,
in Radhakrishna’s and Janakidevi’s. Janakidevi, however, is
uneducated and the hope of her shaping up which I had cherished has
dried up after Jamnalal’s passing away. I therefore cannot explain to
her the position about the Bank and have not even tried. Radhakrishna
is very clever. He has practical sense but cannot be said to be
educated. You have been to England and have, besides, made some
mark as a business man. As for self-confidence, you have more of it
than is good for you. Be that as it may, as heir to Jamnalal and head
of the family it is to you that I have to look up. I, therefore, advise
you to do the best you can to bring glory to your father’s name as a
philanthropist. If you think it beyond your capacity, be humble and
caution me in time. Not all sons can or do follow in the footsteps of
their benevolent fathers. If, therefore, you also fail to do so, nobody
can point a finger at you. And in any case who am I to do so? But as a
grandfather I should at least advise you and caution you. Having done
so, I would quietly accept what you do. I think I have said enough.
Ponder over it carefully and let me know, at any rate, whether the
advice I have given to Bharatan is correct or not.

VIDYALAYA  1
SEVAGRAM ,
November 22, 1945
I expect much from the students who have come here for study.
Not only I but also those who take interest in this work, expect much
from you. There are many educated people in India who criticize and
run down our programme. Some of them oppose it on principle. At
present I do not want to say anything about them, though I have a
ready answer for them. But we should listen to those who have some
interest in this work and wish to take some part in it. Such people
hope for much from khadi work, village industries, goseva and work
of Harijan uplift. We should therefore make strenuous efforts to fulfil
their expectations. If you have come here in order merely to earn
your livelihood, then that hope will not be realized.
Many people study in Government colleges. They get degrees
there. They think that with that education they will earn money and
fame and at least become clerks in some Government office, or if not,
they can certainly get jobs as peons. And they become peons not for
the sake of work, but in the hope of getting promotions in future and
making some money on the side. This means that they believe that
once they enter Government service, their life is secure. This is a
matter which needs careful thinking. The Government has provided
several facilities in their colleges. They have provided spacious
buildings, offered large scholarships and given travelling facilities.
How can we compete with all this?
I have already shown several ways of solving this problem. You
have not come here for comforts or for the sake of salary. If you want
to succeed in your aim bear in mind that you have not come here
merely to learn crafts. Of course you have to learn crafts but you
should not rest content with that. Artisans are already there in villages.
They have been doing the same work from generation to generation.
How can you compete with them? Do learn the process, but along with
that you must acquire scientific knowledge. We should think again
and again why we are doing this work, how we should proceed about
it, how we can link it with swaraj. Swaraj has to be attained through
non-violence. There are crores of people living in the villages of
1  The institution started functioning from October 2, 1945.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 365India. We have to emancipate them, serve them and make them
understand the value of this work. If you believe that the mill-owners
can feed the people and if you are satisfied with it then you should
not study here. But the mill-owners can provide for only a handful.
Mill-owners never think at all of the crores of people. I have not come
across any mill-owner so far who has told me that mills can provide
work for the millions.
You have come here to accomplish a Herculean task. You have
to serve crores of people. It is immaterial that you are only sixty-one
in number. But you will have accomplished something if you leave
after gaining scientific knowledge. All the sixty-one of you have to
become guardians or trustees for the millions of people. If your
example is followed, the number will increase. This Vidyalaya is like
the Gangotri1. Its flow will swell like that of the Ganga. This has been
my dream for the last 25 years. The hope that I have cherished has
not yet been fulfilled. Still I am not disappointed at all because I never
lose heart. A great enterprise does not move quickly. Non-violence
marches forward slowly but steadily. Its way is straight. It will overtake
those who move with the speed of an aeroplane. This is my firm
belief.
The knowledge that you gain here is to be imparted to the villa-
gers. You have to create interest in them for such knowledge. But this
is not an easy task. I have been here in Sevagram for the last so many
years. The headquarters of the Charkha Sangh,  Gramodyog Sangh,
Goseva Sangh and so on are situated here. There are very good
workers also. The facilities that are not available anywhere else are
available here. In spite of all this, I have not been able to do what I
wanted to do. But you should not lose heart because of that. You
should ask yourselves why we have not been able to do it. The
teachers should have an answer for this. Those who are sitting here are
neither hypocrites nor cheats. They are sitting here with a firm belief
that sooner or later the key to this problem will come into their hands.
We have to multiply Sevagrams. We have to think not of a single
village but the whole of India. I sometimes think of the whole world as
well. If we had to take care of Sevagram only or had to work without
concern for non-violence and truth, then we could have accomplished
the work but that would not have removed the sufferings of this world.
India is a tiny spot in the world and in it Sevagram is but a speck.
Whatever is possible in Sevagram can also be possible in the world. I
am prepared to spend 100 years for it.
I shall teach you whatever I know if you are prepared to learn it
1 The source of the Ganga in the Himalayas366 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwith patience. But it will not help you to earn money. I can easily earn
a thousand or two thousand rupees. I stayed for 20 years in South
Africa, I can speak some broken English also. Moreover, these days I
am considered a mahatma too ! So anybody will give me two
thousand rupees. But I don’t want all this. On the strength of it I can
collect crores of rupees, but not for myself. So far as I am concerned I
want nothing more than plain bread. In the same way you should also
be content with plain bread. The work here is not easy. If you are not
satisfied with the work here you should leave. You can earn enough
money elsewhere but if you wish to stay here, you should stay with a
contented mind. If you have this feeling that you are one with the
millions, then you will succeed.
You have come here from different Provinces. You eat together
and live together. Your heart should be clean and you should feel that
we are all one. I have started saying that we are all Harijans—indeed
Bhangis. Only when you imbibe such an attitude, will our work
succeed. You will have to be alert every moment and carry on the
work. You will be examined and you will be given a certificate. But
that will not prove your worth. The certificate will not be for showing
to others. It will enable you to know that you have reached a certain
standard and that you have to proceed further. Today certificates do
carry weight but we have to change our values, change our way of life
and also our attitude towards these things.

letter full of real distress. It was not the lamentation usual in your

moment. I too, therefore, felt unhappy. Maganbhai1, too, gave me a
vivid description. And then I heard from Jajuji2 such a beautiful
account of your spirit of service and courage that my heart
overflowed with joy. We shall now be meeting in a few days. Do not

You have too many advisers. That is bad. You should listen only to

anybody else, and if someone comes to talk to you just close your
ears. You will then quickly recover. And don’t worry in any case.
Since you have given birth to a child, you must bring him up well. It
will be enough if, for his sake at least, you can forget your craziness

I got all your letters and Dr. Sharma’s and quite a number of

these things. Now I see that I shall have to devote some time to the
matter. You emphatically proclaim your honesty and I have as yet no
reason to doubt it. You have already given me the reason for believing
that your conscience is clear and I have accepted it despite opposition
from others. But the attacks of Dr. Sharma and others on your attitude
towards khadi have shaken my opinion. I wrote one or two strong368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIletters to Dr. Sharma. I am sending you the letter I got in reply. He
insists that it should be sent to you. You can give whatever reply you
want to and send it along with his letter.
I am writing this letter with a heavy heart. Dr. Sharma’s
complaint is not a new one. He had the same complaint when he had
come to see me a few months after my release from jail. But I did not
pay much attention to it. Let Chi. Saraswati also read this letter. She

SEVAGRAM ,
November 25, 1945
DEAR SIR EVAN,
I write this in continuation of my letter1 of 10th October. Since
then I have seen other such accounts in the papers and now I have
with me a young man (Shri Prabhu Dayal Vidyarthi) who came to me
while he was yet in his teens, without being recommended by
anybody, as a poor youngster. This was in the year 1935. Ever since
then he has never been out of my observation. He was arrested in
connection with the 1942 disturbances, and has lately been
discharged. He came to Wardha in a dilapidated condition. I was then
at Poona. He reported his arrival and I telegraphed to him to come
there so that I could look after him better and, if necessary, get Dr.
Mehta’s assistance at his sanatorium where I was staying. He narrates
tales of terrible torture, into the details of which I do not wish to go at
this stage.2
On top of this I have received a communication from Dr.
Lohia’s friends and they tell me that Dr. Lohia has gone through
torture himself. He is an able, cultured man who sacrificed a position
of ease and luxury for the sake of the cause of India’s independence.
I know him well and, through him, also his father.
It is difficult to disbelieve all the accounts that have appeared in
the Press and the two incidents mentioned above. I suggest that His
Excellency goes deeper into the matter and not reject the statements as
an exag-geration undeserving of any attention. I take comfort from
the fact that in your letter of 1st November in reply to mine of 10th
October, you tell3 me that though His Excellency believes the story to
be exaggerated, he is making further investigations. I plead for
investigation into all other such statements and, if he proposes to do
so, I am prepared to send you such details as I possess about the two

CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
Champabehn1 is going to stay here in the same way as the others
do. About Sarala’s education I have made it clear to her that while she
stays here, she can neither have tuition from outside nor expect any
other special facilities. She can receive only the education available
here and she has to do as much work for the Ashram as her body will
permit. She will have to be content with the food provided here and
she will have to bear all expenses. She already knows spinning and
other activities.
1.Efforts should be made gently to make Kanjibhai abide by
the rules or else he must be suffered with love. Only love can
understand the language of love. It would be a crime to make a
mechanical approach.
2.I have already had a talk with Kailasbehn. She will stay in
the Ashram. This is a similar problem. Here too the key lies in love.
The same applies to Om Prakash.
3.I would love to keep Govind in the Talimi Sangh but only if

an eye on everyone and sees how he sits, how he eats and what he

right. For instance, at Kocharab, all education was given in the
Ashram. I had made a list of all those who were qualified to teach.
Probably only one or two hours were reserved for teaching. I had
assigned some work to myself too and I used to do my share.

cotton. Let this instruction be imparted at Khadi Vidyalaya. The three

is to be done.
9.Even if Vinoba takes selections from Al Fateha1 and Mazda2
it will have to be in Arabic and Pehlavi. They can be accompanied by
Vinoba’s translation to bring out the meaning. In my view there is
some value in reciting them in the original. I do not take the position
that everything should be in the mother tongue or the national
language.
10.You are right.
11.What you say is correct. I am used to one room only and I
have not had two separate rooms. It is the same thought with a slight
difference at the Christ Seva Sangh.
12.I have written at length about clothing. Go through it.
13.Now I myself take spices. But I hope I do that only by way
of medicine. I take them at the instance of Dr. Mehta but I am not
even aware of their existence in my food. The significant change is
that we have now realized they have as much place in medicine as they
have in taste. Wheat is cooked in so many different ways for taste and
we also make roti out of it to fill the stomach.
14.The quantity of milk is all right. Maybe, even one lb. is
enough.
15.Gajraj has started going to the Talimi Sangh. I think we
should keep him there full time.

There are two sides to it.

November 27, 1945
ALLAMA SAHEB1,
I have your letter of the 21st instant. I am sorry and surprised
that you have again misinterpreted my letter. I had not suggested that
because the correspondence between us was still going on you should
not have your letter published. I had only expressed my view that this
correspondence should not be released to the press. However, if you
think it proper, you may have it published. You are right in saying
that Dastagir2 can come here if he so desires. I had not said I would
comment on each separate clause of the constitution you have drafted.
I had only said that if broad questions are prepared in regard to it, I
could try to reply to them. But from your letter I have begun to fear
that you may misunderstand anything I may say. Be that as it may, if
you formulate a few questions for me, I shall give you written replies
to them. It is unnecessary for Dastagir to come just to collect my
replies. Besides there is not even enough time for that. But whatever
you send at this address will reach me wherever I may be.
I have got one more complaint, namely, why do you write to me
in English?
Yours sincerely,

1 The Khaksar Leader popularly known as Allama Mashriqui
2 Ahmed Dastagir380 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI700. WHY THE INSISTENCE ON THE YARN CLAUSE  1
November 27/28, 1945
This is an old argument.2 One wants to do many good things but
is too lazy. However, when a rule is made the work becomes easy.
Then one finds that one has gained the strength to do the work one
could not do before. By making the yarn clause compulsory, we do
not coerce people. We only make it easy for those who want to spin.
How long can they spin who have no heart in it? It will be hypocritical
if they spin as a demonstration. Hyprocrites only do harm to
themselves. They cannot harm khadi in any way. I would in fact go so
far as to say that he who takes up spinning out of a desire for praise
will gradually develop an interest in the activity and then continue to
spin willingly. If even after long practice he cannot find interest in
spinning, if he still finds it a tedium he will give up khadi. That will
not harm us in any way.
If the khadi bhandars close down because of the yarn clause
they well may. And I do not care whether anyone buys khadi or not. I
do not wish to run a shop. I want people to learn spinning. In Bombay
300 or 350 charkhas are plied. But this number means nothing. What
I want is that there should be as many charkhas plying there as there
are homes. If the cities are to imbibe non-violence there is no other
way. The Government have the force that destroys; I have the
charkha. The charkha alone can save us from destructive force. All
other methods are useless.
If the enforcement of the yarn clause results in reduced sales of
khadi and if the consequent loss forces us to close down the khadi
bhandars, we may close them down. We cannot maintain khadi
bhandars to sell khadi. You will say that if khadi bhandars in the city
close down we shall have to sell khadi in the villages and that khadi
cannot sell in the villages as it can in the cities. I agree that khadi
cannot sell in the villages and it should not. Khadi is not to be sold in
the villages, it is to be worn there. It is to be spun and worn. Rather
than that we should have to get licences from the Government for
khadi bhandars it is better that khadi dies, it is better that the khadi
1 According to the source this is a summary of what Gandhiji had said at
discussions with the Charkha Sangh workers on November 27 and 28.
2 It had been suggested that those who could not tender yarn for the purchase of
khadi should be allowed to buy it for cash, and that making the tendering of yarn
compulsory would amount to coercion.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 381shops close down. Khadi cannot survive if it has to depend on others
for its survival. Then it will be its lot to disappear. Once you
understand the idea behind khadi you will not be nervous. You will
not wonder how khadi bhandars and khadi centres will carry on. Since
we have taken that step, since we have dared, we must be prepared to
face difficulties. If we have to suffer set-backs we must be prepared
for it.
You ask about woollens and silks. Who wears them? Can the
poor do so? Why should we take all the trouble for a few rich people?
These things cannot become universal. We may certainly keep stocks
of woollens and silks in khadi bhandars as we keep other things there
but we must understand that that is no part of our work. We may not
apply the yarn clause to woollens and silks. We may not ask for yarn
when selling these. Do we ask for yarn when selling other village
handicrafts? Woollens and silks come in that category. If we remain
steadfast, the importance of khadi will not diminish. If we think of
meeting the expenditure of khadi bhandars out of the proceeds from
the sale of woollens and silks, it will not help khadi, it will only harm
it. If we carry on the khadi activity with the help of woollens and silks
we shall become crippled. We shall not be able to carry on with the
khadi work. Khadi work can sustain itself. It does not require
dependence on anyone.
No one can kill khadi. How can mills do so? Mills may
themselves be destroyed. We do not worry on that account. All the
activities concerned with khadi, right from the picking of cotton to the
weaving of khadi, should be carried on by the khadi bhandars. Selling
of khadi is only a minor activity. Kakubhai is the secretary of the
Bombay khadi bhandar. I want to see how skilled he is. I want to see
in his hand not a pen but a charkha. He should be an expert in all the
processes employed in khadi. If I were in a bhandar I would spin, I
would card. We have to teach people spinning and weaving through
the bhandars. Today we do try to teach people how to ply the
charkha. But if khadi is to reach every home we must teach people
ginning, carding and all the other processes. I do not much care for
buying slivers. One should make slivers oneself. Today machine-
made slivers are used. The practice must stop. Everyone should card
his own cotton, make his own slivers and then spin. Only then can we
say that we have adopted khadi. I have become a lover of hand-
carding. Even inferior cotton such as mathia, hand-carded, can yield
yarn of the fineness of 20 counts. The mills cannot produce yarn of a
count higher than six or seven from this cotton. I prefer hand-carding
to carding with a bow. It does not expose one to the risk either of
consumption or asthma. Even a queen in her palace can easily take382 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthis up. Even children and old men can card and make slivers. It is a
simple and easy activity.
Today we must not think of spreading khadi by carrying it
about on our backs and hawking it. We have not to give anyone
ready-made khadi. We shall say, ‘take this charkha, take this cotton,
card it, make slivers and spin. Get the weaver in your village to weave
it and then wear it.’ I would in fact say that the khadi bhandars not
only should not have khadi, they should not even have slivers and
cotton. If people demand them we may give them cotton and the
necessary tools and arrange for spinning to be taught. You will then
see that the country will have no dearth of khadi or cloth as such.
Cloth is frequently rationed and still cloth famine persists. I can
remove it. If I was made responsible for it, I could provide cloth to
everyone. I am going to Bengal. If they do as I desire, I shall see that
there will be no cloth famine there.
You ask if you should provide khadi for hospitals. For where
will the patients find yarn, how will they be able to spin? Similarly
there are the Congress committees, the district boards, the banks. Then
there are exhibitions, Congress meetings and so on, which require
khadi worth thousands of rupees. Where can they all find the yarn?
Would it not be right to give them khadi without insisting on yarn
being tendered? I say that if these institutions cannot tender yarn they
should give up the idea of khadi. They can borrow the yarn, they can
make their members spin or they can obtain it from friends. I want to
allow no exceptions to the rule. I have taken in hand the nature cure
clinic of Dinshaw Mehta at Poona. Do you think I can use mill cloth
there? I said to Dinshaw, ‘I shall give you my yarn and you can buy
khadi in exchange.’ Everyone will have to give yarn, be he a raja or a
maharaja.
The yarn clause allows for buying yarn from the neighbours,
but this is against my intention. I do not want this. What I have said is
that people may take yarn from their neighbour but they may not pay
for it. We do not take things from our friends by paying for them.
That would be commerce. If we do not have something we take it
from the neighbours and later when we get it ourselves, we return it.
As a good neighbour he may not take it back but in any case no
payment is involved.
There is in the resolution also the provision for one’s servant
doing the spinning. It is the same as the members of one’s family
spinning and one tendering the yarn in one’s name. But it would not
be right if someone were to employ a servant specifically for spinning
because that is the same as buying the yarn. If a servant employed forVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 383household work spends a little time on spinning for his employer we
can have no objection. At the Times of India office, Bombay, they
wanted some khadi. They came to me and asked, ‘Where shall we find
the yarn?’ I said, ‘You have so many peons and workers in your
office who do nothing but paste addresses. Allow them an hour or two
every day for spinning. Teach them the art. And use the yarn so
produced to buy khadi.’
I suggested spinning clubs being organized in cities. But I see a
different meaning has been put upon what I had said. The Club at
Bombay became an agency for the sale of yarn. Workers are
employed who spin for wages and then people buy the yarn to
procure their khadi from the bhandars. This is to murder truth. What I
had said was that since large cities are too cramped and people have to
live in very small rooms where there is no space for spinning or
keeping the charkha or carding, clubs should be organized in various
localities and in the precincts of khadi bhandars where people could
go to card, make slivers and spin.
This could remedy the lack of space for spinning. Also it would
be easier to arrange for instruction in spinning. But the clubs that have
been started are of a totally different kind and they should be
discontinued. We should not leave hold of truth. We must not deceive
ourselves. We must give up the lure of selling khadi. We should now
develop an interest in teaching khadi. If this results in the sale of
khadi stopping we should not mind it. But the khadi of my
conception can only prosper by this means.
You ask what should be the character of the Bombay khadi
bhandar now. I myself am anxious to make my idea clear. In the first
place we must shift the bhandar from a central market like
Kalabadevi. We should take it to a suburb such as Dadar or Vile
[Parle], where we can find enough space. The work of the bhandar
also should undergo change. The manager will not try and persuade
people to buy khadi. He will sit in the bhandar and spin on the takli.
His co-workers will do the same. He will talk to the customers and try
to explain to them the new khadi policy. If someone is willing to learn
spinning he will teach him. He will not use ready-made slivers. He will
teach all the processes. beginning with hand-carding. He will also
gather at the bhandar some artisans. He will have looms operated
where the yarn spun can be woven. He will have charkhas and other
implements manufactured. He will repair the implements of the
customers. The surroundings of the bhandar will be clean and the air384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwill be pure. There will be cleanliness. The charkhas will be in proper
order and the atmosphere will be congenial for spinning. It will also
have facilities for selling khadi. The Bombay bhandar up to now has
been a clearing-house. It will still be that though in a different way. So
long we only worried about what the Bombay customers wanted. If a
handkerchief of a particular design was in vogue we told the
production centres to make such handkerchiefs. If it was a sari with a
particular border we told the Andhra people to make such saris. We
even used to send representatives of the bhandars to those far away
places to explain what exactly was wanted. We took up printing saris at
Masulipatnam. It revived a dying craft. But if we do not now change
our method of work the same thing will be the undoing of khadi. Now
the centres will have to meet the needs of the areas around them. They
have to produce things with that end in view. In the matter of designs
they do not have to follow the directives of the Bombay bhandar.
Bombay will have to accept whatever varieties and designs are left and
be content with that. It is no part of our duty to provide to the cities
the designs they want. Our duty is only to teach how people can
produce things that they want.
That is the reason why I want the bhandars to be shifted from a
central bazaar. Take some place on the outskirts of the city which is
attractive. Create beauty in wilderness. It is said that the English once
had their factory on the banks of the Tapti on the outskirts of Surat,
from where they started running the country. They wanted to suppress
the khadi and other village industries of India. Our mission will be to
revive them. If some stray artisan happens to come to you, put him at
a loom. Start the work of carding, spinning and such other activities.
Let a model village grow up there. Make the khadi bhandar an
attractive centre. Those who seek peace from the noise of Bombay will
go there on Saturdays if not every day. They will buy their khadi and
learn carding. If you make things you need in the village way the city
folk may also find an interest in such activity.
If you talk about our responsibility to the people of Bombay I
shall ask: ‘What responsibility?’ If the people of Bombay continue
their old interest, what shall we do? Will you be able to interest
yourselves in horse-racing, gambling, cinema, theatre, dancing? What
can you do about people who want to pursue these? Yes, if they want
the facility to live in the style of a village we may invite them. That
will be doing our duty. You say that in a city like Bombay where
people are politically conscious we can make khadi a success only ifVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 385we are able to persuade them that the success of our political work
depends on our pursuing this new khadi policy. I shall only answer
that khadi has value to me only if it is a symbol of ahimsa. An
American once said that it was not words that grew but it was the work.
Your success will depend on what kind of khadi bhandars and what
kind of surroundings for them you can create with your faith and
tapascharya .

701. KASTURBA NIDHI’S POLICY REGARDING
EDUCATION
November 28, 1945
Whatever work regarding education is carried on under the
Kasturba Nidhi, whether it is for children or adults, should be given
only through manual labour and handicrafts.
Trained teachers will be required to carry on this work properly.
Arrangements should be made to give training to these teachers in
registered training schools.
So long as such teachers are not ready, education can be
imparted through manual labour and handicrafts but instruction in
handicrafts should also be given in a proper way.
The teachers should study the literature of Nayee Talim and
carry on their work on those lines as far as possible till they get
properly trained.

SEVAGRAM ,
November 28, 1945
CHI. VANUDI,
I got your letter. I have no doubt about your purity, nor about
your firmness of mind. But if you yourself have some doubt, however
faint, regarding the propriety of what you do, you should carefully
think over it and change your habits suitably. Suppose, for instance,
you tell somebody in jest that you are married and have a few
children, and add that your mother-in-law is dead. Such jokes are386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIpermissible, but the dangers in them are easy to see. That is why even
in the highest circles we still hear criticism of certain things that take
place in theatres. If a married man acts the part of Rama in a play and
a woman married to another man that of Sita, how far is that desirable
for both? It also requires to be seriously considered what kind of
effect such Rama and Sita produce on the spectators. That carried
away by the modern trend we may do or like improper things or see
others doing that is altogether a different matter. I do not wish to
dwell at length on this, nor have I the time for that. But you are a
thoughtful girl and I have, therefore, put before you in a few words an
important question for you to think over.
I hope you keep good health, and trust that all of you devote
yourselves to keeping the Arogya Bhavan clean in every possible
manner. You have with you many visitors now. Use the services of
them all in cleaning up the place. I am trying to send Munnalal there.
I expect he will arrive there in about a week.

CHI. KANTI,
I got your postcard, as also the report sent by you. The latter
seems to have been drafted by you. If so, your English is weak.
Ordinarily this should not count as a deficiency in one, but in India it
is; for we take pride, though we ought not to, in being able to speak
and write a foreign language correctly. I am a lover of all languages
and take scrupulous care to write correctly, but I am more eager to
convey my meaning and am not scared of making mistakes. Were it
not so, I would never have been able to speak in Hindi and other
languages. Having said this, my criticism of the report is that its
English is not correct. I have no time to revise it and return it. The
report itself is good and, therefore, I show it to everybody who is
interested in it. I am now sending it to Jajuji to read.
I shall not feel sorry that you will be breaking up an
organization which you have brought into being. Your leaving it will
amount to breaking it. I only hope that your action will not be an
expression of the rashness and anger which I have observed in your
nature. Sometimes it becomes one’s dharma to humbly cling to the
organization one has set up, despite the co-workers’ coolness towards
oneself. I have been doing this from a much earlier age than you are
at present and it has certainly benefited me. Endurance is a virtue
worth cultivating. You are a student of the Gita. Ponder the profound
truths contained in it. After cautioning you thus, I unreservedly accept
your decision. If you teach the students who come to you and take    388 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImore intimate interest in their lives, you may perhaps be able to create
another organization with their help. In future lay stress from the very
beginning on all the processes relating to cotton. I have come to
realize from daily experience that this is of the utmost importance.
My good wishes for the result of your examination.

full encouragement to those who are engaged in the cleaning activity.
You must also pay as much attention to it as you can while doing your
own work. You will have already decided to dispose of all the
furniture. You can take it to Bombay and sell it there to recover the
price or if you want me to dispose of it you will let me know, so that I

do for you whatever shopping there is to be done. He is well versed in
all the three things and has done them all before. I understand that
Mr. Mange is looking after the accounts and shopping. I wish to keep
him entirely out of all this. I have no doubt that he should train
himself for something else. He should become a naturopath. He
should also educate himself. If you wish that Munnalal should not go

707. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS
Q.The object of the constructive programme is stated to be the preparation
of the people for a non-violent political order. Is this definition correct? Or will it be
better to define such a social and political order as one in which no one would be able
to exploit the labour of another?
A.Your definition is correct but it is incomplete. In what way it
is incomplete will be explained in the answer to your next question.
Q.If my definition is correct I feel such a social and political order can be
achieved theoretically even by our making the largest use of machinery. In that case
is it necessary to have the maximum number of village industries for the non-violent
political order? If so why?
A.Non-violence cannot be divided into compartments. Non-
violence is an inherent attribute of man or, at any rate, it should be an
attribute of man during his waking hours. Devotion to non-violence is
the highest expression of his conscious state. If we thus conceive
ahimsa we should satisfy all our necessities by the labour of our
1 Nature Cure Clinic at Uruli Kanchan390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhands. If we do not do this we shall have to depend upon other powers
and as long as such condition persists we shall be unable to realize a
state of fearless-ness. Another danger in making more and more use
of machinery is that we have to make great efforts for the protection
of it, that is to say,
we shall have to keep an army as is being done today elsewhere
in the world. The fact is that even if there is no danger of aggression
from outside we shall be slaves to those who will be in control of the
big machinery. Take the case of the atom bomb. Those nations who
have atom bombs are feared even by their friends. If we take a wise
view, we shall be saved from the working of machinery.
Q.One of the reasons given in favour of hand-spinning is that it makes one
self-sufficient. Can one who is self-sufficient serve society better than one who is
dependent on others? Do you mean to say that there is such a connection between
self-sufficiency and social service that the more one is self-sufficient the more is
one’s capacity for social service?
A.In order to satisfy this doubt also we will have to keep in
mind the non-violent outlook because truth and non-violence form
the foundation of the order of my conception. Our first duty is that
we should not be a burden on society, i.e., we should be self-
sufficient. That means self-sufficiency by itself is a kind of service.
After becoming self-sufficient we shall use our spare time for the
service of others. If all become self-sufficient no one will have any
difficulty. In that case no one will be required to undertake service of
others. But we have not yet reached that stage and therefore we have
to think of social service. Even if we succeed in realizing complete
self-sufficiency, man being a social animal we shall have to accept
service in some form or other. That is, man is as much dependent on
others as he is dependent on himself. When dependence becomes
necessary in order to keep society in good order it is no longer
dependence but becomes co-operation. There is a fragrance in co-
operation and there is no one weak or strong among the co-operators.
Everyone is equal. There is a feeling of helplessness in dependency.
Members of a family are as much self-dependent as interdependent,
but there is no feeling of mine or thine. That is why they are called
co-operators. Similarly when we take a society, a nation or the entire
mankind as a family all men become co-operators. If we can conceive
a picture of such co-operation we shall find that there is no need of
depending upon lifeless machines. Or we shall have to use them the
least, not the most, and therein lies the real security and self-protection
of society.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 391Q.You lay more emphasis on spinning than on agriculture. Is there any
political reason behind it? Or is it because people cannot take to farming as easily as
they can to spinning?
A.I do not make such divisions as social, economic and
political. What is political is also social and economic. One includes
the others. It is true that we make and have to make such divisions for
clarity of understanding. One of the reasons why I have not laid stress
on agriculture is that even my knowledge of it is almost nil. How will I
be able to enlighten you if I put emphasis on it? It is not so in the case
of the charkha. I have acquired enough knowledge of it. Secondly
under foreign rule the charkha had died out; it had been destroyed.
Agriculture can never be destroyed but its form has been so changed
that it has increased the slavery of the people. The third reason for
putting emphasis on the charkha is that skill of hand has a very small
place in agriculture. There is hardly any other industry in which the
hands and the fingers are so much used as they are in the various
processes that go to make khadi. The fourth reason is that foreign
power first takes hold of the land and through it controls the other
things. Therefore Government help is very necessary for improvement
in agriculture. For these and other similar reasons I have laid more
emphasis on hand-spinning.
Q.One of the features of the material development of human society appears
to be that man is tending to move more and more from self-sufficiency to dependency.
Don’t you think this tendency is not right and that there will be revival of the
opposite tendency?
A.I take this question to mean that society is advancing
towards machinery. If I have understood the question right, my
answer is that society must get rid of its slavery to the machine. By
being slaves to the machine our slavery to our senses and their activity
also increases immensely.
Q.Are you confident that the constructive programme will be able to achieve
its object during your lifetime by mere propaganda? Don’t you think taking into
consideration human frailties (lust, anger, greed, infatuation, pride and jealousy) that
there will be need for “legislative aid”1 to make the people take to the constructive
programme on any wide scale especially in this machine age? Will there be any
violation of the principle of non-violence in taking such help from the elected
representatives of the people? If so how?
A.I have said many a time that we will have to take help from
the Government on our own terms. Not only that, we will have to take
help from the whole world There was a time when I felt that we could
have only the barest minimum of help from the legislators in the
matter of constructive programme. But now I have come to realize392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthat if the representatives of the people go into the legislatures we can
secure their help. Along with this we must bear in mind that we cannot
appreciate the value of the constructive programme properly if we
cannot carry it on in adverse circumstances. Other people of course
can’t. I can say dispassionately but from experience that the strength
of the people has increased in proportion to the progress of the
constructive programme. If we can make the constructive programme
universal and get it implemented through the people, then swaraj is in
our hands.

Perhaps the expression “Gandhian Constitution” is not a fitting
title for Principal Agrawal’s3 pages. It may be acceptable as a
convenient and compact title. The framework is really Principal
Agrawal’s, based on his study of my writings. He has been
interpreting them for a number of years. And as he is anxious not to

for Sodepur on November 30, 1945
3  Shriman Narayan Agrawal394 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImisinterpret them in any way he would publish nothing without my
seeing it. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage
is obvious. The disadvantage lies in the reader mistaking the particular
writing being my view in every detail. Let me then warn him against
making any such mistake. If I were to commit myself to every word
appearing in these pages, I might as well write the thing myself.
Though I have endeavoured to read the constitution twice, with as
much attention as I was able to bestow on it during my other
engagements, I could not undertake to check every thought and every
word of it. Nor would my sense of propriety and individual freedom
permit me to commit any such atrocity. All, therefore, I am able to say
is that the brochure contains ample evidence of the care bestowed
upon it by the author to make it as accurate as he could. There is
nothing in it which has jarred on me as inconsistent with what I would
like to stand for.
The author was good enough to make such alterations as I
thought were necessary.
The word “constitution” must not mislead the reader into
thinking that the author has made any profession to give him a
complete constitution. He has made it perfectly clear in the beginning
pages that he has only laid down broad lines to indicate what a
constitution of my conception would be. I regard Principal Agrawal’s
to be a thoughtful contribution to the many attempts at presenting
India with constitutions. The merit of his attempt consists in the fact
that he has done what for want of time I have failed to do.

Gandhian Constitution for Free IndiaVOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 395712. LETTER TO MANAGING COMMITTEE  OF THE TALIMI
SANGH
November 30, 1945
Yesterday I went to see the Talimi Sangh hostel. You know
Hoshiaribehn1 who stays in the Ashram. I have sent her son Gajraj to
your school. He insisted that I should see his school. Even yesterday
morning he came and said: “You will come, won’t you?” I said:
“What shall I do at your school? I would rather see the place where
you sleep.” I had intended to send his mother too. Anyway, I went
there after my morning walk to keep my promise. I was pained by
what I saw there. I noticed filth and mismanagement which should not
have been there. I had not wanted to spend much time there, but I
could not bear what I saw there and spent half an hour or
threequarters of an hour explaining things to Pandey.
I found there were puddles of water in front of the verandah of
the children’s hospital. It offended the eye. The children wash
themselves right there. This breeds mosquitoes and so much of water
is wasted. We should collect the water in a tub. Or we may wash beside
the trees near by. If there were a thousand boys it would be a disaster.
Going through the room I found the same thing in front of the
verandah on the other side.
Then I went to the children’s dormitory. Even at the entrance
there was a lot of dirt. I went in. Mats were not properly kept. I had
the bedding of a boy unrolled. It was very dirty. The bed-sheet was
torn. It was stitched in a couple of places, but very crudely. The other
tears had not been attended to. They should have been patched. If the
sheet was too badly torn it could have been doubled and stitched.
Many times in jail I had got mattresses made that way. They are warm
and strong. The cotton of the mattress had collected into big lumps. It
was not warm. That cotton should have been taken out and carded
again. Several pieces of cloth were discovered from under the
mattress. They were very dirty. I would have kept those pieces clean
and used them for patching. The mat was very dirty. It should have
been washed.
1 Niece of Balvantsinha. According to Balvantsinha Gajraj had complained to
Gandhiji that Talimi Sangh was a very dirty place.396 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII examined the floor. It is used for sleeping but is in a very bad
state. Pandey said cow-dung was not available. It is better if cow-dung
is available. But one can do without it. Where was there cow-dung in
South Africa? We managed with earth. There was a wooden shelf
fixed to the wall for keeping things. When I touched it my hand was
covered with dust. I wiped my hand on Pandey’s hand. It also got
covered with dust. One boy had put his ink-pot on the mat. Where else
was the poor boy to put it? But there was no method about it. I
examined each and every pen and nib. I saw also the ink-pots. That is
my way. That should also be the way of Nayee Talim. Everything was
wrong from my point of view. These are small things. But small things
make up big things. It does not required money. It requires a keen
vision, it requires art. It is our duty to teach these. It is the purpose of
Nayee Talim. It is the teacher’s fault if it is not done. It is your fault. I
would say that it is my fault. After all, the responsibility lies with me.
What is the point in starting a thing and then giving it up? If someone
says that in this way he can look after only one boy, I would say admit
only one boy. Do not admit more. An element of untruth enters if we
admit more boys and cannot look after them.
As I came out, I noticed the sacking you have hung up along
the verandah. For this I must quarrel with you. A verandah is designed
to admit air and sunlight. By fixing sacking around it you shut out
both. And the room at the rear becomes absolutely useless. If you say
it can’t be helped because the boys are too many, I would say that we
should take only as many boys as we can accommodate. We should
not take more.
Pandey’s mother Kodamba was in very dirty clothes. She
looked like a maid servant. She did not even know Hindustani. And
she has been with us for two months. Even Pandey’s own clothes were
not quite all right. The neck was open and so also the cuffs. We are
labourers. Our shirts must have half sleeves. Brass or glass buttons are
useless for us.
I had a brief discussion with Asha Devi1. But I am writing in
detail because these matters, though small, are very important. And
failing in these points, we depart too far from our objective.
I have read this again. It seems to be all right.

WARDHA,

I am not going to Bengal to serve four or five persons, but I am
going to Bengal to serve crores of persons.
Referring to garba dance which the girls executed, Gandhiji said:
No doubt garba dance is famous in the world but this is no time
for such dance.
He said that he was going to Bengal to serve humanity and wished that the
girls would shower blessings on him and pray for his successful programme.
Referring to the sari spun by the inmates of the Mahila Ashram from the yarn
produced in non-stop spinning during last Gandhi Jayanti, Gandhiji said that he
would not like to take the sari with him.

According to me what the All-India Congress Committee meant
is clear. If constructive work is not carried on keeping non-violence in
mind and accepting it rationally, India will not achieve swaraj as a
result of it. A lot of work always went on in our villages but it was not
informed by the knowledge and the vision of non- violence. So all we
achieved was that we did not become as bankrupt financially as we are
today. And when foreign invasion started, we abandoned the village
industries one after another. Work for eradication of untouchability,
uplift of Adivasis, equal rights for women, imparting training and
bridging the gulf between the poor and the rich and so on had never
been taken up. When we realized that to achieve real freedom the only
royal way was that of non-violence and truth, our range of vision
extended to the whole of India and beyond it to the whole world, and
despite India being a slave country its fame spread in the world. I am
firmly of opinion that if, as stated in the question, we forget all other
aspects of non-violence except non-killing of human beings, non-
violence will not remain non-violence, it will become bereft of truth,
its universality will be lost and we shall never achieve swaraj. If ahimsa
includes destruction of others’ property, boycotting Government
servants, going underground and so on, then, we can neither awaken
the crores of people nor give them the correct training in fearlessness.
If we want to work non-violently, then it is necessary to accept the
restrictions laid down by me. But if we do away with these restrictions
then there will be no other alternative for us but to abandon non-
violence and to train the people for violence. That this way is totally
futile for us has been proved by this barbarous war. At any rate by
openly accepting the way of violence we save ourselves from
deceiving our own people and the world at large.
[From Hindi]
Khadi Jagat, November 1945
1  This was in reply to the question : “How far is the inference correct that in
trying to make non-violence practical and progressive,  people could arrest others or
run away, go underground and destroy property but not kill or hurt anyone ?”  It was to
make this point clear that the All-India Congress Committee deliberately added the
words “accepting non-violence rationally”.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 399716. SPEECH ON NAYEE TALIM  1
November 1945
Nayee Talim means teaching through craft. That basic craft has
to be selected in the light of the conditions and produce of the region.
For instance, it would not be proper to have khadi as a means of
teaching in a region where cotton does not grow, but has to be
imported for the purpose.
If Nayee Talim can be proved to be self-supporting through
khadi, then the same thing can be applied to other industries too. What
I mean by making education self-sustaining is this. Just as the expense
on food and clothing for the children studying in Government
schools is borne by their parents, similarly, in Nayee Talim schools,
parents will have to bear the expenses on food and clothing of their
children. But the expenses incurred in the schools of today on books
and fees will be saved.
There should be no place for books in Nayee Talim. Initially
some expenses may have to be incurred on cotton, carding-bow, and
takli and so on. Afterwards the only expenses will be on the teachers’
salaries, stationery, and the salaries of peons, etc., if they have to be
engaged.
Suppose, there are thirty boys in one school. They will handle
all the processes right from collecting cotton from the field to
spinning and weaving the yarn into cloth. Through every process the
teacher will educate them so that their intellect sharpens day by day.
This will result in students’ making ever new discoveries in the
methods employed in the khadi industry which will make it more
productive and profitable.
The cloth produced by students will be purchased by their
parents at any price. It will be the teacher’s duty to see that through
his students he creates an awareness in their parents that they may not
even touch foreign and mill-made cloth. We should also see that an
atmosphere of self-sufficiency in cloth and khadi is created. We shall
have to create an atmosphere of our own. For bringing khadi to the
stage it has reached today, we had to make efforts and create the
climate. As a result no one now can root out khadi. The same thing
can be said of Nayee Talim also. If the teacher is unable to create the
necessary atmosphere, Nayee Talim cannot become self-reliant and
cannot make headway. If he succeeds in creating the atmosphere and
sharpening the intellect of the students, then the entire expenditure
from beginning to end on Nayee Talim can be met from the sale of
1  This appeared under the title : “Self-reliance in Nayee Talim”.400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcloth produced by students.
Students will be equipped for earning when they leave our
schools. We do not promise them jobs. The Government also does not
promise employment to students who are trained at enormous expense
in Government schools. But our students will be brighter than the
students of Government schools and will easily find occupations for
themselves.
We must remember that when atmosphere had to be created for
Government schools, they had to put in considerable effort in spite of
the way being clear. The atmosphere we have to create is for revival.
That which has been destroyed has to be revived in a new way and we
look upon it as a peaceful way of attaining swaraj. It should be easy to
do this. We do not find it easy as we have not gone to the villages with
the correct attitude and have made no real attempts at all. Now we
have Nayee Talim. If it does not work a miracle and develop power,
then what is it good for?
We do not realize the full significance of boys and girls being
entrusted to our care from their childhood and undergoing craft-
based education in our schools for seven years or more. And the
modern education which is being imparted to us teaches us that
schooling can never become self-supporting. This creates some
confusion in our minds. It is my firm belief that if Nayee Talim
cannot become self-supporting, then the teachers do not understand
what it is. In my view, amongst other characteristics self-reliance is the
most important characteristic of Nayee Talim.
If this is so for the education of boys and girls, then adult
education must also be self-supporting. If we believe that it is difficult
to convince adults about the value of education, then I have to say that
this is nothing but an old illusion. And the teaching of the three R’s in
adult education is no part of our Nayee Talim. The meaning of adult
education is that we will give them, through their own language, all-
round education of a pure and socially useful life. And if they do not
easily become self-supporting,  in my view there is some serious defect
in that education. We should not also forget that complete co-
operation should be the basis from the very beginning. Those who
know the full meaning of co-operation will raise no doubts about self-
reliance.
QUESTION:  Today only those students go to Government schools whose
parents can pay for their food and clothing. We expect that under Nayee Talim, all the
children of a village will go to school. There may be many among them who do not
have the necessary food and clothing in their homes. What is the responsibility of
Nayee Talim in such cases?VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 401A.I have just stated the ideal that parents will provide for food
and clothes. Even now boys do eat and wear clothes. The parents will
pay to school whatever they spend on their children’s food and
clothing. The diet we give will have a scientific basis. The expense will
be a little more because of the milk. That expense will be met by the
school. But when we persuade the parents to bear the expense on
food, then they will pay for milk too. Those who are very poor will be
very few; but if they are really poor then we can certainly bear the
entire expense.
I shall not worry about what clothes the girls and boys should
wear because my ideal for them is a loin-cloth or clothes that a baby
wears. It may be a brief kuchchha. We can easily make it. When girls
develop breasts something will have to be done to cover them. The
answer is a piece of cloth of the kind that is in vogue in the South. It is
a different matter what provision is to be made in winters. You may
not provide them any wraps but you must give them enough to wear.
All this will be our property—the boys and girls of the same age
group will wear them. One thing should be kept in mind, that these
boys and girls will stay with us most of the time. We can easily bear all
this expense. According to us the clothes for the poor and the rich will
be the same. If the clothes are clean and of the right size, they will
look as neat and tidy as naked children look.
Q. (a) Will there be an increase in the demand for cloth if an atmosphere of
self-reliance in cloth is generated?
(b) Even if parents want to purchase cloth produced by their children, do they
have the means to pay the price that we may ask for it?
A. Any price must of course mean reasonable price. This merely
means that those who do not even touch khadi today, will certainly
buy the cloth made by their children if we sell it at a reasonable price.
There will be no question of making a large profit on it. The price of
every item will be different but by and large the difference between
the cost price and the selling price will be almost the same. Even if the
price of fancy goods is higher, still comparatively it will be much
cheaper. Those who buy them will pay the price willingly. When self-
reliance in cloth is achieved, everyone will accept khadi and will do so
willingly. Then Nayee Talim will have reached its peak. Not one will
even care for me if this happens during my lifetime.
All my answers apply to the present time, the present conditions.
Q.Training of teachers is a vast field that we have before us. In what way are
we to practise self-reliance in this training.402 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIA.Your question is, how can those who have come here to be
teachers become self-reliant? If young students can become self-
reliant, the teachers must become self-reliant. The question is only one
of bearing the expense of one’s own food, clothing and education.
My point is that if teachers themselves cannot become self-reliant, how
can they make the students self-reliant? In fact well-to-do persons who
have come here not for salary but for service, will not need any
supervision. They will learn all occupations attentively and carefully.
They will not waste anything because of carelessness. Such people will
be able to meet their entire expenses from whatever occupation they
undertake. Your curriculum ought to be such that teachers and
students can earn enough for their expenses while they learn. You too
will be put to the test in preparing such a curriculum. I like this
question very much because it is a good sign that you have raised this
question in the very beginning. Aryanayakum has written: “I have
understood and agree with it.” This means that I also should have the
same thing in mind that he has.
If your syllabus is not based on the above lines, let me know.
Perhaps I may be able to make it with your help. I go so far as to say
that even wood should not be available free of charge. Bear in mind
that we want to work in co-operation. We also want to learn true co-
operation. Hence the fruits of everyone’s intelligence and skill should
go into one pool. As I go on writing the subject becomes more and
more interesting to me. I become more and more confirmed in my
belief that self-reliance is the key to our success. This is proved by
long experience.

I am sending today your booklet2 and my Foreword3. I finished
everything at 9.30 last night. In between I only took time off for
eating and spinning. Let me know if any changes are necessary in the
Foreword.
Let me know if you do not agree with the changes I have made
in your booklet.
You will see that I have left the place of the Panchayats at the
taluka and district level rather vague. They are only advisory bodies.
Why should they be given a place in the legal framework? Even the
necessity for their existence is a matter of doubt. When the villages
really come to life, the need for advisory bodies should be less. The
Provincial Panchayat would attend to everything and would get things
done through talukas and districts. If you think there is any snag in
this line of thinking let me know. I have put in as much hurried
reading as I could.
It is worth I considering if Pakistan and the Princes can have any
place in my conception [of India]. Remember that the Gandhian plan
can be successful only if it can be achieved through non-violent
means.

I have gone through circular 12 and Dhwaja Babu’s letter. I am
of the opinion that the fund that we have will be enough for the
training in handicrafts and adult education. If both the activities go on
together the expenses will be lessened. These funds should not be
made to cover the other five activities. This does not mean that we are
not to pursue those five activities or that they are of secondary
importance. We shall conduct them with a separate fund. If we think
of all the seven activities we may not be able to deal with any one. I
am therefore of the opinion that this fund should be earmarked only
for the two activities. Even when the fund grows later on, it should be
limited to only the two activities. Of course all this requires hard work
and intelligence.
If necessary you may use this letter. I am returning the circular
and Dhwaja Babu’s letter.

720. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS  1
December 1, 1945
I know America and America knows me.2 People in America
who want messages do not really know me. You are prompting me to
say something, but why do you not pay for my Harijan Fund?
1 While he was on his way to Calcutta, a number of journalists had entered
Gandhiji’s compartment at Kharagpur and travelled with him till the train reached
Mourigram.
2 One of the Journalists had asked for “a message for America and American
people”VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 405Another journalist asked Mahatmaji: “Can we send what you said for
publication?” Mahatmaji laughed and said:
Cook it, digest it and assimilate it. Use your journalistic sense
and you will see what I have given you is something other than a
stunt.
Questioned regarding his reactions to major questions of the day, Gandhiji
said:
Great problems lie before us and as and when they arise, my
views will be there.
He declined to commit himself further.
When one of the newspapermen queried him about his travel from Wardha,
Gandhiji, with his proverbial fund of wit, retorted jokingly:
You have been travelling with me and if your journalistic
instinct does not prompt you to answer that question, resign your post
and take to something more useful in life.

721. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING
SODEPUR,
December 1, 1945
He began by referring to his attempts made since 1914, when he was in
England to learn Bengali. He made some progress in it, though he could not keep up
his Bengali studies. It was his ambition to be able to speak to the people of Bengal in
Bengali so that he might be able to penetrate into their hearts. He was sorry he could
not do so on the present occasion. He was also of the opinion that no Indian could
call himself a full-fledged citizen of India unless he could speak to the people of the
various provinces in their own tongues. Failing this proficiency in the different
languages it was the duty of every Indian to learn at least Hindustani which alone
could be the rashtrabhasha1 of India.
He then proceeded to give the etiology of his present visit to Bengal. Ever
since his release from prison, he had been anxious to visit Bengal but he could not do
so owing to ill-health. Moreover, he did not want to visit Bengal unless he was sure
that the authorities would welcome his visit and that there would be no restrictions on
his movements. He was not prepared to submit to any restrictive orders on the one
hand or on the other to offer civil disobedience against such orders under conditions
now prevailing in the country. Even after the way for his visit to Bengal was clear it
had to be postponed for several months on account of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who
1 National language406 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwas in need of nature cure treatment and needed his (Gandhiji’s) presence by his side.
He was glad, however, that after all he had been able to come to Bengal.
Explaining next the object of his visit, Gandhiji said that it was purely to
offer whatever consolation his presence in their midst could give to the victims of
Bengal famine and to do whatever he could to relieve their distress. He had not come
to take part in the politics of the province or in the forthcoming elections. In fact, as
they all knew, he took very little interest in these things. Where his chief interest lay
was too well known to need reiteration.
Mahatmaji then concluded after appealing to the people assembled to
contribute their mite to the Harijan Fund as a token of their sympathy with the cause
of the abolition of untouchability as also to ameliorate the condition of Harijans.
Incidentally he mentioned that in this way he had collected 2 lakhs of rupees for the
Harijans since his release. The proceeds of the autograph fees that he charged were
earmarked for the Harijan Fund. Anyone by paying a fee of Rs. 5 could have his
autograph. There could be no exemption on the ground of poverty because according
to him the autograph-hunting was essentially a rich-man’s hobby. Anyway, there was
none poorer than the Harijans and consequently none had a right to cheat the Harijans
out of the autograph fees which had been premortgaged to them.

722. DISCUSSION WITH IAN STEPHENS  1
SODEPUR,
[On or after December 1, 1945 ]2
GANDHIJI:  Arguing on those lines, you will be able to understand
the prejudice in South Africa too. The root cause—a false notion of
preservation of the race and economic status—is common to both.
The difference is only one of degree. If you apply concrete facts to
individual cases it is half a dozen of one and six of the other. It is on a
par with the racial prejudice here.
IAN STEPHENS: Oh, no. Here it is much less.
G.Yes, owing to the vast disparity in numbers. But take the case
of the individual who actually suffers. His experience does not differ
from that of the coloured men in South Africa or America.
1 This report by Pyarelal appeared under the title “With an English Friend”.
Ian Stephens, a correspondent of The Statesman, Calcutta, was of the opinion that
colour bar and racial segregation was at its worst in South Africa, and did not agree
with Gandhiji that it was equally bad in America.
2  Gandhiji reached Sodepur on December 1, 1945.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 407I. S. We, Englishmen are apt to forget that side of the question.
G.Habit becomes second nature. There may be no deliberate
intention either.
I. S. In the Punjab and Delhi races mix much more freely than elsewhere. Was
that due to the fact that the disparity in numbers was comparatively less there?
Gandhiji was of opinion that the contrast presented by Bengal in this respect
was perhaps due to the violent spirit having manifested itself there on a much larger
scale than in Delhi or in the Punjab. The Punjab did show the violent spirit in some
measure. But it was not a patch upon Bengal. The daring of the Chittagong Armoury
Raid was neither attempted nor duplicated anywhere else.
I. S. I have often thought over it, and it has always baffled me how these
Bengali young men, so gentle by nature, have drifted into violence.
G. I have solved it for myself. They feel they have been
unjustly libelled in the past. Lord Curzon harped on their softness. It
soured them. So they say, ‘We may not be wealthy, but surely we are
not effeminate.’ So they adopted this devious method and surpassed
every other province in daring. They defied death, defied poverty and
even public opinion. I have discussed this question of violence
threadbare with so many terrorists and anarchists. It is terrible whether
the Arab does it or the Jew. It is a bad outlook for the world if this
spirit of violence takes hold of the mass mind. Ultimately in
destroying itself it destroys the race.
I. S. And it has spread all over the world for the last two or three years.
G.Look at the latest ukase of Gen. MacArthur1. He has divided
the entire Japanese nation into two categories, those whom he calls war
criminals and those who do not come under that label. As I read it, it
struck me that this was not the best way to introduce democracy
among the Japanese—a race so proud, so sensitive, so highly
organized along Western lines. They will do what the Italians did in
Garibaldi’s time on a much larger scale. You cannot deal with the
human race on these lines. Whatever happens in one part of the world
will affect the other parts. The world has so shrunk.
This evoked from the friend the observation that he did not think that the
world had deteriorated so much theoretically as it might have during the last three
years. Gandhiji agreed with him though his grounds, he remarked, were different.
I. S. My reason for that belief is that in spite of the fact that suffering, for
1  Douglas MacArthur, U. S. Army General; Commander of the occupation
forces in Japan after the War.408 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIinstance in Indonesia and elsewhere, has been appalling during the last three years,
the human mind has not been equally warped.
G.My hope is based on a detached view of the situation. Whilst
in detention in the Aga Khan Palace I had leisure to read and think.
What struck me was that whilst practice showed deterioration, the mind
of man had very much progressed. Practice has not been able to keep
pace with the mind. Man has begun to say, ‘This is wrong, that is
wrong.’ Whereas previously he justified his conduct, he now no
longer justifies his own or his neighbour’s. He wants to set right the
wrong but does not know that his own practice fails him. The
contradiction between his thought and conduct fetters him. His
conduct is not governed by logic. Then, of course, there is my
standing prediction in favour of non-violence that it will prevail—
whatever man may or may not do. That keeps my optimism alive.
Extensive personal experience too confirms my belief that non-
violence is self-acting. It will have its way and overcome all obstacles
irrespective of the shortcomings of the instruments. It makes no
difference how we arrive at our conclusion, but it keeps us fresh and
green.
The conversation next turned upon Gandhiji’s pet theme of living up to 125
years. Gandhiji’s visitor wanted to know how he managed to keep physically fit.
Gandhiji replied that outwardly he owed his physical fitness to strict adherence to
regular habits in eating, drinking and sleeping and to his partiality for nature cure
principles which he had adopted strictly in life since 1901. Reminiscently he
described how up till 1901 he used the medicine bottle but had almost thrown it away
and for forty-five years he had lived more or less according to nature cure principles.
G.But, in a still greater measure, it is due to the practice of
detachment of mind. By detachment I mean that you must not worry
whether the desired result follows from your action or not, so long as
your motive is pure, your means correct. Really, it means that things
will come right in the end if you take care of the means and leave the
rest to Him.
He based his belief on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita which he had called
his “dictionary of action”.
The friend remarked on the close analogy between the teaching of the
Bhagavad Gita and the thesis presented in Aldous Huxley’s1 Ends and Means. The
mention of Aldous Huxley’s name revived in Gandhiji’s mind memories of old days
1 British novelist and critic; in later life became increasingly drawn to Hindu
philosophy.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 409about Aldous Huxley’s father1 whose writings he used to read during his student days
in London in 1889.
I. S. But there is a physical side all the same?
G.Yes, only I attach greater importance to the mental. What
you think you become. Thought is never complete unless it finds
expression in action and action limits your thought. It is only when
there is a perfect accord between the two that there is full, natural life.
I. S. But what about the legacy of one’s past life? It cannot be written off the
balance-sheet.
G.I have my answer for that. If my past conduct does not
warrant the full span of life, no matter however correct my present life
may be, I can still counteract the effect of past mistakes by attaining
complete detachment between the mind and the body. Detachment
enables one to overcome the effects of past faulty practice as well as
handicaps of heredity and environment. Normally speaking, every
deviation from the rule of nature, whether ignorant or wilful, e. g.,
anger, ill-temper, impatience, errors in conjugal life, exacts its toll. But
there is this promise that if you have arrived at complete detachment
you can rub out all these. “Except ye be born again, ye cannot have
everlasting life.” Conversely, you can have everlasting life if you are
“born again”. There is no hurdle placed before death. You can turn
over a new leaf and begin life anew here and now; the past will not
disturb its tenor provided you have completely severed yourself from
it and its legacy by the axe of detachment.
On the previous occasion when this friend had visited Gandhiji, Gandhiji had
done all the talking and the friend had listened. This time Gandhiji had intended that
he would only speak in answer to questions and let the friend do the talking but the
friend again had the better of his resolve. Gandhiji remarked, discomfited, at the end
of their talk:
I admit defeat. After all you are a practised journalist.
I. S. I am only human.

was, however, the grandfather of Aldous.410 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI723. DISCUSSION WITH MEMBER OF FRIENDS
AMBULANCE UNIT
CALCUTTA,
[On or after  December 1, 1945 ] 1
F. A. U. MEMBER: However much we may want to be friendly the past tradition
clings round your necks and drives you to desperation. It seems to me, that there is
hardly any hope of giving to a young Bengali student an idea of the better side of
Englishmen unless perhaps he is transferred to England. The atmosphere in India is
so poisoned that I wonder if it would not be better for Englishmen not to attempt to
come to work in India just now but to wait for better times.
GANDHIJI:  Any friend, who is a real friend, and who comes in a
spirit of service, not as a superior, is bound to be welcome. India, when
she has come into her own will need all such assistance. The distrust of
Englishmen, as you say, is there. It won’t disappear even by
transporting Indian students to England. You have got to understand
it and live it down. It has its roots in history. The late Charlie Andrews
and I were bed-fellows. There were scarcely a thought in our mind
which we did not share. He even adopted Indian dress though
sometimes with grotesque results. But even he could not escape
suspicion. He was even dubbed “a spy”. His was a very sensitive
spirit. He suffered unspeakable anguish under these unmerited attacks
and I was hard put to it to dispel the baseless distrust. ‘If he is a spy, I
am a spy,’ I said to these critics. In the end C. F. A.’s spirit
triumphed.
Pearson2 was C. F. Andrews’ disciple and friend. He too came in
for his share of distrust. Then there is Stocks3. “If I am to serve India
I must become an Indian,” he said to himself and married a Christian
Rajput. He was boycotted by the Rajputs. The Government distrusted
him too in the beginning. But he has lived down the distrust of both
1 Gandhiji reached Calcutta on December 1.
2 W. W. Pearson, a British missionary worker in Bengal and for some time a
teacher in Santiniketan
3 Samuel Stokes, a British missionary and an associate of C. F. Andrews.  He
was a member of the Congress and courted arrest in 1920; became a Hindu to deliver
the message of Jesus to the Hindus; changed his name to Satyanand, and took up work
for the uplift of the Hill tribes at Kotgarh.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 411the Government and Indians.
If then, even a C. F. Andrews and a Stokes and others had to
labour under distrust, for you to be distrusted may not be wondered
at. So far Indians have known Englishmen only as members of the
ruling race—supercilious when they were not patronizing. The man in
the street makes no distinction between such an Englishman and a
good, humble European, between the Empire-builder Englishman of
the old type that he has known and the new type that is now coming
into being, burning to make reparation for what his forefathers did.
Therefore, if one has not got the fire of sacrifice in him I would say to
him: ‘Do not come to India just now.’ But if you are cast in a heroic
mould there will be no difficulty. You will in the end be taken at your
worth if you persevere. Anyway those of you who are here have no
reason for going back.
The same friend was able to elicit from Gandhiji what he considered to be the
weak spots in the Indusco Plan of Chinese co-operatives. Firstly, the Indusco was a
product of abnormal times. Its production was war-time and war-purposes production
stimulated by the Japanese blockade. Secondly, it was organized by foreign
missionary enterprise and their work was tainted by the proselytization motive.
G.If you try to merely copy the Chinese co-operatives in India
you will end in miserable failure. Here you have to work among
Indian Christians. The temperament is different, the character is
different, and the circumstances are different. Co-operation which is
rooted in the soil always works. You have therefore to find out for
yourself what type of co-operative is best suited to the Indian
temperament and soil. Even those who have become converts to
orthodox Christianity are today veering round.
M.By “veering round” you mean going back?
G.Yes, I mean going back to real Christianity, to Christ, not
Western Christianity. They are beginning to realize that Jesus was an
Asiatic. Having seen this they are reading their Bible through Indian
eyes. You should study the meaning of Indian Christianity through J.
C. Kumarappa’s book Practice and Precepts of Jesus.

725. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING
SODEPUR,
December 2, 1945
Addressing the congregation after the prayer Gandhiji said he would like to
thank them and congratulate them because they had maintained silence and were
peaceful during the prayer. The gathering of this evening was very big indeed. On
Saturday the prayer meeting was less crowded. On both the days they had shown
remarkable discipline. So he would thank them and hope they would continue to
behave calmly in future also.
The prayer song which was sung this evening had a special significance.
Gandhiji said it was very appropriate in the conditions obtaining at present. The
song was also sung in a very melodious tune.
In the song there was an appeal to God to lead humanity from darkness to
light. It said the humanity was engulfed in thickening darkness and had lost vision.
So they were praying to God to give them strength and lead them to light.
The import of the song was that they must be freed from all bondage and attain
enlightenment. The freedom from bondage also included the winning of swaraj. India
wanted release from the bondage.
We are all engulfed in darkness today. Not only India but the
world also is engulfed in darkness. India wants peace. So also does the
entire world. We are all travellers groping in that thickening darkness.
We are all blind and cannot feel the absence of light.
The prayer we have offered is the most important thing of this
evening. I was in South Africa when I used to pray privately. When I
returned to India I saw the necessity of holding mass prayers. I have

61th birthday.VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 413been holding mass prayers since then. There is of course the necessity
of individual praying in his own way.
Our prayer today to God is to lead us from darkness to light,
from untruth to truth, and let us have peace—peace not only for India
but for the entire world.
Gandhiji said he did not like the shouting of slogans. The shouting of slogans
disturbed the peaceful atmosphere which was the condition prerequisite to holding
prayer. So he would request them not to distrub the peaceful atmosphere of the place
by shouting slogans.
In conclusion, Gandhiji asked the gathering to remove untouchability from
their midst. Untouchability was a slur on humanity.
Gandhiji then requested those who had assembled to contribute their mite to
the Harijan Fund.

SODEPUR,
December 2, 1945
I know your love for me. I also want to love you. I also want to
win your heart. But that I want to achieve through work. Do not ask
for my darshan or want to touch my feet. I am not God; I am a
human being. I am an old man and my capacity to stand the strain is
limited. If I am to appear before you again and again my strength will
be exhausted. And I will not be able to do work.
So my request to you is that you should not ask for my darshan
or request me to stand before you so that you may touch my feet. If
you come at prayer time you will have my darshan. But I want to
impress upon you that I like peace. I do not like shouting of slogans
or claps. They irritate me. If you love me you will not do so.
Amrita Bazar Patrika, 3-12-1945

SODEPUR,
December 4, 1945
BHAI VALLABHRAM,
I have your letter. After I return to Sevagram and settle down
there you may certainly come if you wish.
May be you are not acquainted with my views as they have
progressed. They were of course implicit in all my writings but of late
they have become more explicit. I have no longer any interest in
marriages, whether within the caste, inter-caste or even interprovincial.
Therefore, so far as possible, I do not say anything anywhere on the
subject of marriages. As it is I hardly ever attended any and now I
have firmly stopped attending them altogether. What I believe is that if
we want to preserve whatever is good in varnashrama every Hindu has
to become not only a Shudra but an atishudra1, and regard himself as
such. And as a true indication of it marriages should really take place
only between atishudras and the so-called other varnas. These
marriages also should be not for the sake of indulgence but so as to
observe restraint and keeping in mind the restrictions it implies.
Now I can send my blessings to Chi. Ramakant and Chi. Tara.
May they be happy, live in restraint and may their alliance be doubly
devoted to service. Often after a marriage instead of one sevak
multiplying into two both the parties drop out of service. This is my
experience. There are exceptions, and may this union be one such. To
that end pure restraint on your part will prove helpful to them in every
field.
The Medical Board has not been lax; it has to do work that is
vast in scope. Besides, they are contemplating a co-ordination of the
various systems of medicine; so the matter it seems will take some
time. Let me also add that although I have a great regard for

BHAI SAILEN
It is thought, and it has been my experience, that through the
power of prayer, heart-felt prayer, one can achieve what cannot be
achieved by any other power. Swaraj is a very small thing. But prayer
should not be recited mechanically. True prayer transforms the life of
a man.
Your second question displays sheer ignorance on your part.
When did I say that I would live up to 125 years? If I can be so
arrogant I shall be God as the questioner says. On the contrary I do
not know whether I shall be able to take the next breath. What I have
said is that I want to live for 125 years while rendering service. And I
have also said that all should aspire to that end. We can only wish. I
am an humble devotee of God.

737. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  1
SODEPUR,
December 4, 1945
Gandhiji explained that the real purpose of the prayer could not be fulfilled
unless the congregation became calm and quiet.
I have just seen that a crowd of people have entered the prayer
ground after we have finished the prayer. I must remind you all that
the prayer begins punctually at 5 p. m. (Bengal Time). Those who
want to join the prayer must reach the place earlier.
Proceeding, Gandhiji said that he was happy that such a big gathering attended
his prayer. He was also happy that those who had unfortunately came late had imbibed
the mass feeling and stood at the edge of the congregation and listened to what he had
1 According to the source the gathering included British, American and
Chinese nationals as also a large number of women students.420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIto say very calmly and quietly. Even though they could not take part in the prayer
they were very silent. That attitude, said Gandhiji, was what the prayer intended to
teach the average man. It was called self-control and was a great factor of human life.
For the last sixteen years he had practised it. Whenever he was late in attending any
meeting or function he decided better not to go at all as otherwise he was sure to
disturb others. When placed in such a position he requested friends to excuse his
inability to comply with their requests for attending the meeting. He would strongly
urge upon those who came to attend the prayer to learn the virtue of self-control and
develop it in their lives.
During his stay in Calcutta, concluded Gandhiji, he would try to explain the
social and other important aspects of self-control and prayer.

[After December 4, 1945 ]1
CHI. BHAGAWATI,
I have your letter. How will the marriage be performed at
Gondia? Will there be some rites or will it take place before the
magistrate? You have not made it clear. I, of course, wish you both
well. I can never have any objection to such marriages if they are not
for mindless indulgence but for exercising restraint, for expanding the
field of service and enhancing the spirit of service. Actually, I can
even encourage such marriages. That is why I wish to have a reply to
the above question.
What is the girl’s brother doing? Why does the girl not write to
me? I am certainly eager to know what she has been doing since she
first visited the Ashram.

other one I have already read but I don’t know where it is now. It is
not lost. But I agree it should reach you at the earliest. I am sorry

happened.
It is good that you gave me the information about Manibhai. I
have had a talk with him. I now have my eye on him. I am very keen
on engaging him in Dinshaw’s clinic. I believe that the experience he
will gain there will prove very useful for village work. Moreover, since
he has to spend some time with me he will certainly be under my
supervision from time to time and so I shall myself get better
acquainted with him.
I hope you are getting on well at your end.

740. LETTER TO JIVANJI D. DESAI
SODEPUR,
December 5, 1945
CHI. JIVANJI,
I got your letter and the cheque. It has to be considered whether
we should go as far as you suggest regarding the copy- right.
Anybody writing to us for permission and our giving it will mean that
we have read the work or got it read by someone and approve. In this
connection Anand Hingorani had suggested different Boards, so that
the Tamil Board would decide about the Tamil translation and the
Malayalam Board would advise about the translation in that language.
There would, thus, be a separate Board for each language. We have to
consider how far it would be advisable and becoming for us to bother
ourselves to that extent.
There are several translations of Tolstoy’s books in the same
language. All of them are not up to the mark, and the titles of the
books also have been translated differently. All of them sell, but the
translation which is most faithful to the original, most painstaking and
beautiful sells more than the other translations. The same has
happened in the case of the Bible. The authorized version is there but
there are many others in the field and their publication is not
prohibited. Every translation has its own circle of readers.
You have raised the question of the Autobiography. A
translation has been brought out by one Tamil publisher and now this422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIis the second. How would we know which of the two is really good?
Or would it be advisable to stop other translations from being
published? I do not see much benefit in that. Even when we decided
to claim copyright, I did not go as far as that. This matter cannot be
looked at from a purely legal point of view, nor from a purely
financial one. We should look at it wholly from a moral and practical
point of view. And looking at it thus I feel that we should permit the
person who has written to us to publish the translation. I have not
replied to him, however. Consult all the others and discuss the matter
with them and suggest whatever reply you think should be given. I
will think over it and then send a reply to the man.

Gandhiji spoke about the technique and purpose of prayer which was to

achieved the individual man got a fresh lease of spiritual enlightenment to sustain
one for the next 24 hours.

with Gandhiji’s views on home-spinning and weaving but he was against each
cultivator growing his own cotton as that would reduce the already very small areas

cultivators from the thraldom of monsoon or other disabilities arising out of lack of

DEAR FRIEND,
I write this about the little crematorium on your ground. You
know perhaps that when I was a prisoner in the Aga Khan Palace in
Yeravda the ashes of Mahadev Desai first and then of my wife were
buried in your compound. The remains were cremated there at the
Government’s instance. They would not let me cremate them outside
at the usual crematorium. Through Government’s good grace and
your people’s forbearance, friends have been able to have access to
the above crematorium. I have been pleading with the Government
that they acquire the little plot and some right of way for devotees.
Now that you are in India, may I look to you to facilitate my request
in the manner you think proper?
I hope you are keeping well and that we shall meet before you
leave India again.

may, if you like, increase the duration gradually. Cover up the body
to start with and, as you feel warmer, remove the cov ring gradually till
finally you are stripped of all clothing. This will not only cure the
chest complaint but I am sure make the whole body perfectly healthy.

Why should you feel concerned over anything that you may

absolutely necessary. You should attend to only three duties there and
discharge them to the best of your ability: writing the accounts, doing
the marketing and maintaining cleanliness. In doing the last you may
occasionally have to express your opinion, but in doing the other two
things you need speak nothing. If you keep up courage and faith,
your work is bound to win appreciation. But even if it does not, what
does it matter?

duty. He should not be a burden in any way. From what Kanu tells me
he seems to be a totally useless man.

753. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING2
SODEPUR,
December 6, 1945
In his introductory speech Gandhiji referred to the incident which  took place
at Sodepur Railway Station when one person either in attempting
to board a running train which was not scheduled to stop at Sodepur or for some such
reason was run over and killed.
They might think that when there were crores of Indians what did it matter if
one met with death in such circumstances. But that was a totally wrong view. And if
they allowed themselves to think in that way they would not be able to build up a
brotherhood in India and secure her salvation. They must instead think that the
person who met his death the other day was one of them and must feel sorry for his
tragic end.
Perhaps, said Gandhiji, he himself was partly responsible for his death for the
deceased went there either to see him or to attend the prayer. The congregation too
was partly responsible because after the prayer was over they rushed to the Station,
vied with each other to catch the train and thereby created a situation which caused
this death. They, therefore, should henceforth take the vow with him not to create any
such situation in future which might cause the death of a fellow-brother.
All this happened because they were not disciplined. The prayer was intended
to confer upon man that discipline which he required so urgently. If they were
mentally disciplined through the practice of prayer they would no more commit the
mistake they committed the other day.
If by prayer they could be mentally disciplined, stated Gandhiji, they would
1 The subscription is in Tamil.
2 The meeting was also attended by Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Jawaharlal Nehru.VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 - 6 DECEMBER, 1945 429attain a state which was nobler and higher than even the salvation of India.
Perhaps, freedom of India could be maintained with the help of pistols or
swords. But were those weapons of any value if their votaries were not disciplined?
Therefore whether a country was wedded to violence or non-violence discipline was of
paramount importance to all men.
Without discipline it was difficult to attain swaraj as he had stated two days
ago.
If they practised prayer with all concentration they would find that all their
difficulties would smoothen.
Concluding, Gandhiji referred to an incident in South Africa when a ship came
upon a rock and was about to sink. Its Captain was a strong-willed and disciplined
man. He preserved the calm of his mind and realized that he could not save all lives.
He, therefore, secured the safety of as many men as he could and then went down with
a hymn to God on his lips alone with the sinking ship. If he was not a disciplined
man, said Gandhiji, he could not have saved the lives of the many passengers of the
ship whom he brought to safety. What was, therefore, urgently required of all was
discipline and this all men could aquire by actively participating in prayer.

APPENDIX  I
LORD  WAVELL’S  VERSION  OF  HIS  TALK  WITH  GANDHIJI1
I deplored the recent speeches of Congress leaders and said that the preaching
of violence could only lead to violence, especially with the inflammable material in
India, of young students and goondas (the Indian equivalent of hooligans); and that
fomentation of racial and communal hatred would not produce the atmosphere in
which a solution could be produced in next year’s discussions.  He admitted the
violence of Congress speeches and indicated that he was trying to get the tone
lowered.  I said that an agreement of some kind between Hindu and Muslim was
necessary, even if it was an agreement to part.  He said he had always tried for a
settlement but was frustrated by the British policy of divide and rule.  I said this was
nonsense, we tried our best to bring them together; that the increase in communal
feeling was mainly due to the action of Congress Ministries in 1937-39 which had
made Muslims feel they would not get a square deal from Congress and had caused the
rise of the Muslim League and the idea of Pakistan.  He defended the Congress
Ministries at some length, and said all Governors had admitted their fairness.  I said
there was no doubt about the psychological effect on the Muslims, whatever the facts
may have been; and he admitted this.  I then said that the British were accustomed to
abuse and misrepresentation from Indian Nationalists, but that there was a limit, and
that it seemed hardly wise to antagonize us at this moment when we were trying our
best to bring about a settlement, and that India after getting her freedom would want
Britain’s co-operation in defence and in commercial development.  I added that if any
disorder resulted from the hatred now being stirred up, it would of course be my duty to
suppress it, and I should do so by all means in my power.  He assented to this; and
then said that India needed no help from Britian in trade or defence.  She would
develop her trade in her own way, and her defence would be the moral force of non-
violence, which would eventually conquer the world and bring about universal peace.
I said I did not think either of us would live to see this desirable issue, and that the
immediate point was to prevent violence in India during the next year or so.  We left
it at that.  He was quite friendly though woolly, and seemed in good health.

The Agony of ValliammaForeword
 M
y curiosity about the life of Valliamma, the child 
martyr who was murdered by the colonial regime when 
she was barely sixteen, was first piqued by my dear and now departed mentor, Soobry Pillay.
 I
t brewed within me for years, occasionally tempt-
ing me to write her story. Sadly, other more pressing pri-orities intruded. 
 I wa
s continuously amazed, though, that through-
out that period no one whom I spoke to had heard of this remarkable girl. Nor, to my knowledge, had anything of substance been written about her. This disturbed me.
 Th
e Universe, however, has its own agenda.
 W
hen Soobry Pillay passed away, a little over a 
month ago, I began to feel guilty; he had repeatedly ex-horted me to record her story and I had not responded to his request. It was then that I mentioned my procrastina-tion to Y ana, Soobry’s son. I also commented that I could not find much information about Valliamma.
 Th
at casual conversation, over a cup of coffee, sud-
denly opened up a new world to me.
 Y
ana, in his usual manner, came over the next day 
and dumped a load of historical documents onto my din-ing room table, much of it rare and not easily obtainable elsewhere.
 T
o say a simple ‘Thank you’ to Y ana is not enough. 
My appreciation is unbounded.
 H
owever, the environment that Valliamma lived 
in, more than a hundred years ago, is the product of my own research, as is my style and the narrative, including the imagined dialogues between the protagonists.
 A
ny errors, omissions, and flaws are mine, and I 
accept full responsibility for them.

idwinter. Icy cold. Bitterly gusty. The freezing wind 
whipped through the shack-like houses of Indian labourers scattered around the Mooi Street ghetto in Johannesburg, home to some of the forgotten and neglected scraps of soci-ety.
 M
unuswami, chilled to the bone by the biting frost, 
shivered violently as he stepped through the flimsy and rick-ety door and looked earnestly at the midwife, the concern on his face reflected in his eyes.
 “
Mangalam is fine. So is the child. It’s a girl. Mother 
and daughter are resting. ” 
 M
unuswami sighed with relief, placed his basket on 
the ground and headed for the bleak and dreary corner where his wife and child lay huddled on the floor, wrapped in a sheer and insubstantial sackcloth and a threadbare military style overcoat.
 “Y
erru, thumby, ” the midwife exclaimed in Tamil – 
“Wait! There is something I must tell you. ”
 M
unuswami hesitated, not pleased by the distrac-
tion. But there was a look in the ancient woman’s eyes, some urgent message, which made him obey her request. 
 “
I am old now. I have been doing this work for over 
seventy years. I have seen much and there are those who will tell you that I am very spiritual and have psychic pow-ers… ”
 “ I k
now that, amma. I haven’t forgotten that you 
attended to my mother when I was born. She often told me that I was stillborn and you breathed life into me. ”
 “
Only God can do that! You listen to me now. Care-
fully. My time is up. I have looked into your child’s eyes. She has seen God. She will do His work. She is also deeply

The Agony of Valliammaintelligent. But she is not of this world. She will leave at an 
early age, long before she gives you any grandchildren. But she will do much greater things. Like you, she will fight the enemies of our people.
 “Y
ou need to remember that as she grows up. And 
you must support her in her struggle for justice. You are her father and that is also your dharma. I must go now. At-tending to her confinement was what I was born to do. My job is done. May the Lord Krishna watch over you and your f a m i l y.”
 B
efore the words had fully registered and while he 
still waited for her to reveal some greater secret, the midwife picked up her haversack and disappeared. 
 M
unuswami stood, transfixed, his mind in turmoil: 
Had he been dreaming? Was his imagination playing tricks with him? Had she really been here? And then he recalled something else his mother had told him, that the ancient lady was not given to speaking loosely. And that her pre-dictions were legendary and always accurate – often only manifesting themselves many years after she had first men-tioned them. And what did she mean, what was the mes-sage she had conveyed? He was confused, rooted to the spot and unmoving.
 A
nd then he heard the baby cry, the sound cutting 
through his thoughts. He shrugged his shoulders, sighed, and then swiftly moved to his wife’s side.
 
“Mangalam…?”
 “
Come, my husband. Take your child in your arms 
and warm her frozen body. And whisper her name in her e a r.”
 “
Her name…?
 “Y
es. Yes. It’s what we agreed on. ” 
 “W
hat? In my excitement I have forgotten… ”
 
“Valliamma. ”

West End Hotel. Durban 1970
 S
oobry Pillay was angry, his eyes blazing with 
fury. “Those names that you boys just mentioned, ” he 
said, somewhat irascibly, the irritation in his voice obvi-ous, “I have no problem with them. They all fought for our freedom. Goonum! The Meers, Monty Naicker, Yu-suf Dadoo…I knew them all. Personally. And they were great leaders of the Resistance. Everyone knows that. Their names are etched in our memory. But all of you, how much do you really know, about the unsung heroes, about the early fighters who gave their lives so that we can be free?”
 “
I know, Tata, ” a youngster muttered, “There were 
many others… ”
 “
Y ou know nothing! Many others? Tchah! Finish 
your drink and I’ll give you the next one on the house. But you listen nicely now. I don’t like repeating myself. ”
 “
Okay, boss, ” Thumba smiled. “Go ahead, educate 
u s .”
 “
And that is something else I don’t like. I’m no man’s 
boss! We are all equal here – isn’t that what you were tak-ing about?”
 “
Sorry, boss…I mean Tata. I take that back. ”
 “
Y ou learn fast. That’s a good quality. ” As he spoke, 
Soobry bent over and reached under the counter, extract-ing a writing pad and a pencil. “Write this name down, ” he instructed, “Do it carefully and correctly. I’ll spell it out for you: Valliamma Munuswami Mudliar. ” 
 “
Hey, Uncle Soobry, ” Abbas shouted from a nearby 
table, “I’ve heard of her. My old man once told me she gave her life for the people. He said she was a great lady. ”
 “
She was a child, ” Soobry retorted, almost rever -

 “
Y a? A child?” a third patron standing at the far 
end of the bar counter smiled. “How old?”
 “
How old?” Soobry smiled back, his voice low. 
“When they murdered her or when she first took on the 
Nazis?”
 “
Nazis?” Thumba asked, his face a mask of confu-
sion. “She was in the war…?”
 “
I told you boys, you know nothing. Y es, it was a 
war, but not the one you’re thinking of. In the early days we referred to the apartheid government as ‘Nazis. ’ But I’m talking of a time before then, around 1906, when Val-liamma was only about eight years old. She told those rac-ist bastards their fortune. ”
 A
bbas gave a low whistle, then asked in a voice that 
was half-disbelieving, half-admiring, “Only eight years old? Y ou have to be kidding! And how old was she when they killed her?” “Not yet sixteen. ”“ And they actually killed her?”“Y ou could say that. ” “Tata, ” Thumba asked quietly, his eyes suddenly soft, “Tell us more. I’m intrigued. ”“Intrigued? Nice word that. But I donno what it means. But look, my relief barman will report for duty early to-day. Y ou boys come here, at about seven, and bring your friends. We’ll go into the backroom and I’ll tell you a story that will warm your hearts faster than that drink in your hands. ”
There were five of them, huddled around an old wooden 
table. Thumba Pillay, Abbas Jinna and Sonny Murugen had been in the bar earlier. Now they were accompanied by Mohan Govender and Sam Naidoo.
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   12 2011/11/01   1:59 PM13
The Agony of Valliamma “ Okay, ” Soobry Pillay said, his voice barely audible, 
“I’m going to give you lighties a history lesson that your schools were not allowed to teach you. And it’s as true as the day you were born.“In those early years, around about 1890, a fruit and veg-etable hawker by the name of Munuswami Mudliar dai-ly lugged a heavy basket that was attached to a wooden pole that he balanced over his shoulders, just behind his neck. Earning a living was not easy, and he was up early every morning to buy his wares from the market. In win-ter his wife, Mangalam, would light a fire in the center of their shack to keep her family warm. She collected coal from around the railway lines. Munuswami barely earned enough to put food on the table - and they had no table so they sat on the floor - and pay rent to the slumlords.“’I sell food so that we can eat, ’ he often cried bitterly when his customers haggled over the price of his goods.“In 1898 they had their first child, Valliamma. When Mu-nuswami, a few years later, complained to his wife that the child played in the yard as if the cold didn’t affect her, his wife replied with a smile, ‘The fire is in her heart. This little one is a fighter. ’”Listening to Soobry narrating Valliamma’s story, the boys felt as if they had been transported back in time. They were paying rapt attention. “Y ou must remember, ” Soobry continued, “that the girl was born in a family of Passive Resisters. Both her parents were in and out of jail regularly. For what? Fighting for justice! It didn’t stop them from opposing the unjust laws, and Valliamma, the oldest of their four children, refused to stay at home and take care of her siblings. She went to every political rally and listened to every word that the leaders of the time, great men like Gandhi and Thambi Naidoo, told their audience. Wasn’t long before the little girl often jumped onto the stage and, with her dynamic

The Agony of Valliammapersonality, raised the ire of the people. And she was only 
eight years old at the time!“Y ou find that hard to believe? Go check the facts. They’re all there, somewhere in the records of the Transvaal Tamil Society. What was it that motivated the child to become a freedom fighter? Was it a commitment to justice? Anger at the way people of colour were being treated? The pain that her parents and other Passive Resisters suffered in jail? The brutality of the unjust laws? Maybe it was all of those things… ”The boys were entranced. The old barman had fired their imagination. His physical presence had faded, all they heard was the voice and were suddenly caught in a time warp – living in an environment and back to a time when a girl  far younger than them was the heroine of their lives…

Johannesburg. 1906.
 
 V
alliamma was tired. Her bare feet were swollen 
and a cut under her big toe made walking painful. She kept to the edge of the pavement, trying to keep the ball of her wounded foot off the paving. It helped a little. Not much, but enough to continue on her journey.  I must get to that rally, she kept repeating to herself. I must not be late.
 W
hen she entered the schoolyard, to her dismay 
the protest meeting had just ended and a priest was lead-ing the congregation into prayer. Valliamma forced her way to the front and, as soon as the prayer was over, she impulsively jumped onto the makeshift stage and, to her own amazement, began to dance, performing the Bharata Natyam with an impromptu display of childish grace. It was a totally involuntary portrayal, and when the audi-ence began clapping in appreciation she looked confused and a little shy, surprised by her audacity.
 S
he painfully lowered herself off the stage and then, 
holding onto an upright post and slightly off-balance, she raised her foot and examined the toe, wincing as it started to bleed again.
 “
Come here, child, ” a middle aged, distinguished-
looking man took her by the arm and then carried her to a chair, signaling with his eyes to one of the officials, who hastily vacated his seat.
 “
What is your name, little one?”
 
“Valliamma. ”
 “
Are your parents here?”
 “
I don’t know. ”
 “
How did you get here?”
 “
I walked. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   15 2011/11/01   1:59 PM16
The Agony of Valliamma “ Y ou danced very well, in spite of the cut on your 
f o o t .”
 “
It’s nothing. The people are suffering more. ”
 “
Excellent! But now we must ask one of the first-
aid ladies to bandage your foot. ” He signaled a stout lady in a nurse’s uniform and when she came over, he simply said, “Bandage this poor child’s toe and see that she gets home safely. ”
 B
efore the nurse could react, Valliamma retorted, 
“Naanpaavamum ille, kazhanthayum ille” – I am neither poor nor a child.
 H
er benefactor chuckled delightfully at her audac-
ity, waved affectionately, and walked away.
 “
Who was that?” Valliamma asked the nurse.
 “
Thambi Naidoo, ” the woman replied, “one of our 
greatest freedom fighters. A man who is in jail more often than he is at his house. ”
 “
Somebody should teach him some manners. He 
talked to me like I was a little girl. ”
 “
But you are –“
 “
Give me the bandage, ” Valliamma retorted blunt-
ly. “I’ll tie it myself when I get home. ”
 “
But… ” the nurse started to object, when Valliam-
ma simply walked away.            
 
“
Amma, at the rally in the schoolyard they said something 
about a law that would make Hindu marriages illegal. ”
 “
Y es. It’s a new law that the government is trying 
to introduce. It could take years and may never even hap-pen. ”
 “
So? Does that mean I will be illegitimate?”
 “
Where do you learn such fancy words? And in the 
eyes of God you are perfectly legitimate, and that is all that matters. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   16 2011/11/01   1:59 PM17
The Agony of Valliamma “ But who gives them the right to go against God’s 
laws? Why don’t we just tell them to go to hell?”
 “
Hush, child! If your father hears you talking like 
that – “
 “
But appa says it all the time. He says those racist 
dogs need to be sorted out. ”
 “
And they throw him in jail. ”
 “
And you, amma? Y ou do exactly what appa does 
and you also end up in jail. They can’t keep doing this. I’m going to fight them!”
 “
Y ou are too young to… ”
 “
Gandhi doesn’t think so. Just last week I heard him 
say we must all make a stand – man, woman, and child. ”
 “
What will you do?”
 “
I will go to every rally. I will listen to Gandhi and 
Thambi Naidoo, and I will join them in the fight against this evil. God says that you must fight evil, and then it doesn’t last. ”
 “
Who told you that?”
 “
I just know it. It’s God’s law. ”
 “
They will throw you in prison –“
 “
I am already in prison. All of us are. These unjust 
laws, they lock up our minds and turn us into criminals. ”
 “
Y our appa and me have been to prison many 
times, for simply going to protest meetings. It is horrible in there-“
 “
The horror is out here, amma. And we are the only 
ones that can put an end to it. We can’t protest when we are in prison. ”
 “
Y our father and I are fighting that battle. ”
 “
Look at him…he leaves home before daylight and 
returns when it is dark. He works all day like an animal and that is how the police treat him. They take his bas-ket of food that he sells from door to door, and say they are confiscating it because he is trading without a license.

and enjoy themselves. This must stop. Now!”
 “
They are too powerful, child. They-“
 “
Are they more powerful than God? He is on our 
side, leading us. We are His army. How can we lose?”
 “
We will go with you to every rally and-“
 “
No, amma. I will go alone. All our people are too 
soft. They make speeches and wait for something to hap-pen. It is time to confront the enemy, to tell them that their evil stops now. It is up to us to change the world. It’s the job I was born to do. And that work starts today!”

The Agony of ValliammaChapter Three
Johannesburg. 1908.
When Valliamma walked up to the stage, many of the 
protesters in the crowd snickered at the child’s audacity. When she started speaking, the snickering stopped, to be replaced with awe and respect.
 “
Those of you who came here today for entertain-
ment, the fun is over. Y ou can go home now and continue to be the government’s slaves. The rest of you, who value your freedom and justice, stay and listen. ” Valliamma’s voice was clear as a bell. A stout lady in the audience turned to her friend and whispered, “Who is this girl? She talks like a veteran… ”
 “
Hush!” her companion replied softly. “It’s obvious 
that she is gifted. I want to hear what she has to say. ”
 “
We were born free, ” Valliamma continued pas-
sionately. “We need no one’s permission to demand our rights. Evil must be destroyed, before it destroys you. And talking, as we are doing today and you have been doing for a long time, will change nothing. We must confront this enemy, in his own castle, and tell him that his time is up! He must now step aside, before the anger of the peo-ple removes him. ”
 Th
e audience was hypnotized. They couldn’t be-
lieve that a mere girl was addressing them, and with such forceful conviction. And Valliamma’s unusual height, her tall body, held them spellbound. Few would have guessed that she was just a little over ten years of age.
 “
What can they do to you, those animals that take 
all your possessions and give it to their own people who have more than enough anyway? Throw you in jail? Feed you rubbish with weevils in it? Beat you up and abuse you? But they are doing that even now, even as we talk. 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   19 2011/11/01   1:59 PM20
The Agony of ValliammaY ou have nothing left, nothing to lose. When you are on 
the ground you can only go up. It is time for you to rise and let the enemy know that you have called on God to come to your rescue. Let them try and fight Him! But God will only be at your side if you go into battle. Talking is not fighting.
 “
Just the other day Gandhiji said, ‘Y ou must be 
afraid neither of imprisonment nor of deportation. Y ou must not mind being reduced to poverty, nor must you be frightened of being mashed into pulp with a mortar and pestle. ’ Listen to him. Learn from him. 
 “
Don’t demonstrate only in our areas, where the 
oppressors don’t see us. Go into their own districts, where they live like kings with money from your hard work. There are good people among them too. Let them see what we have been reduced to. That is a lot better than coming to these rallies and talking among ourselves. We must instruct our leaders that the time for talking is over. ”
 “
Y es!” several voices called out. “We are with you. It 
is time. Lead us. ”
 “
We have very good leaders. Follow them. They 
have the experience to lead all of us. ”
 A b
abble of voices rose all around the gathering. 
The crowd was fired up and ready to march to the white areas. Someone shouted something unintelligible, ap-pealing to Valliamma to continue talking. She had already leapt off the stage and was walking away.
“Who is that girl? Where does she live?”
The slim, distinguished looking man, in his late thirties, was looking earnestly at his companion, demanding an answer.
 “
I don’t know, Mohanbhai. I’ve heard that her par -
ents are very active in the struggle. But look, here comes 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   20 2011/11/01   1:59 PM21
The Agony of Valliammaour friend Ally. He knows the child’s family well. ”
 H.O
. Ally - Ally as he was simply known to every-
one - smiled as he approached Gandhi and his friend, and 
then bowed slightly, simultaneously raising his hands and joining them together in greeting. “Mohanbhai, its good to see you looking well. I heard you were released only yesterday. ”
 “
Thambi and I reached home this morning. His 
wife, Veeramal, is still in prison. ”
 “
Those filthy dogs!” Ally swore under his breath, 
his face flushed with anger, “they respect nobody and nothing. They use their military strength with disregard for human life – black lives. Our only weapon is our unity, and in the end it will triumph. ”
 “
Well said, good friend! Tell me, did you hear that 
little girl a few minutes ago, telling the people to make a determined stand against the government?”
 A
lly smiled widely, the delight reflected in his eyes. 
“That child…the gods smile down on her. She has been touched by an angel! I’ve heard her, often. Give us two more like her, put them in the front line, and the war will be over in a day!”
 “
So you agree with her, ” Gandhi chuckled, “we are 
at war?”
 “
Y ou heard the people applauding her, they cer -
tainly think so. ”
 “
Do you know her family and where she lives?”
 “
Y es indeed! Both her parents are satyagrahis, in 
and out of jail regularly. When he is not in prison he earns a living as a hawker. And when her mother and father are both locked up it’s the little girl who feeds her younger siblings, from money she earns by hawking, just like her father. ”
 “
I would like to meet her family. Can you take me 
to them?”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   21 2011/11/01   1:59 PM22
The Agony of Valliamma “ I’ll be honoured. But don’t expect the girl, Val-
liamma, to bow to you. She is a warrior. And a proud one t o o.”
 “
Our children grow up fast here, ” Gandhi said sad-
ly. “Patience is not a part of their culture. But that is as it should be. And you say she is proud? It’s what I like about our people. Pride is a revolutionary emotion. ”
 “
We can go there now, if you like. ”
 “
Come then. Lead the way. ”
 “
Y ou are our leader, Mohanbhai. But for now, it will 
be my great honour to be in front of you. ” Ally was still chuckling when Gandhi hugged him affectionately.
 “
Thank you for welcoming us so warmly into your 
home, ” Gandhi said to the Mudliars. “Y our courtesy will always be remembered. ”
 “
Thank you, Mohanbhai. I’m afraid that tea is all 
we can offer you. ”
 “
It is all we need. I came to meet your daughter. She 
is a firebrand. We are proud of her. ”
 “
Valliamma? Her mother here says the girl was 
born with a flame in her heart. We worry about her. ”
 “
We are immensely pleased with her and her fight-
ing spirit. ”
 “
She lives for the people. All she talks about is free-
dom and justice. ”
 “
That is all we are asking for. This government, it is 
stupid. It believes a gun can destroy our determination. It is their own people who will pay the price for their folly. ”
 “
When she was born I was told that she is not for 
this world, that she will leave us early in her life. ”
 “
God’s will, ” Ally said, with conviction. “What is 
written is written. ”
 V
alliamma had just walked through the door, and 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   22 2011/11/01   1:59 PM23
The Agony of ValliammaMunuswami said, “This is Gandhiji. That is uncle Ally 
with him. ”
 “
I know them. I have heard them speak. They are of 
the people. ”
 “
We have come to see you, my child, ” Gandhi said 
warmly. “We heard you speak today. Y ou shamed us with your words, your passion. ”
 “
All I was saying is ‘Shatham Prati Satyam’ – truth 
against a rogue.
 “
Beautiful!” Ally exclaimed softly. “ Absolutely mar -
velous! It must become our rallying cry, at all our protest meetings. ”
 Ga
ndhi’s eyes were sparkling, his face reflecting his 
delight. “I am amazed by your choice of words. May I ask you, in all respect, where you first heard them?”
 “
In my heart. Everything I say is from my heart, ” 
she replied bluntly.
 Th
e men were suddenly speechless and unsure of 
how to respond. In the silence that followed, Mangalam, mildly embarrassed by Valliamma’s quick words, diplo-matically stepped into the breach and smoothly took con-trol of the discussion. “She is always like that. She says what’s in her mind… ”
 “
I like it!” Gandhi said approvingly. “It is an admi-
rable quality. The next time there is a rally, she must be on the stage with us. ”
 “
I don’t require a stage to talk to our people, ” Val-
liamma cut in. “They know what we are going through. We should be dealing with our oppressor. ”
 “
Quite right, ” Gandhi responded. “Tomorrow 
Thambi Naidoo is expected to be released from jail. Al-though he has insisted that he does not wish to be met when he walks out of prison gates, Ahmed Cachalia and imam Bawazeer, together with Mister Sorabjee and I, are determined to be there. It is a show of strength, to demon-

The Agony of Valliammastrate to the authorities that we stand united. And we are 
very angry because they have also locked up Cupusamy, Thambi’s 16 year old son, and have no intention of letting him out. ”
 “
I want to be there too, ” Valliamma snapped. “I’ve 
met him. He is a good man and the people love him!” 
 “
That wouldn’t be wise. Those brutes outside of the 
police station are not nice people. In all likelihood we will be attacked even when we stand there peacefully. They respect nobody. Y ou could be badly hurt. ”
 “
Y ou’re not scared of the beating?”
 “
No! They can hurt my body but my dignity will be 
intact. ”
 “
Then why do you think I will feel any differently?”
 Ga
ndhi was stumped. He was astounded by the 
girl’s courage and determination. The look in her eyes, the resolution and fortitude reflected in them, filled him with pride and, simultaneously, provided him with the mettle to pursue his mission with greater determination. It was a quality he had come across occasionally in the past few years, but never in a child of such tender years. And very rarely even among the adults.
 “
Y es…okay. But you must promise to stay behind 
us, out of the line of attack. ”
 “
I make no promises. What happens will happen. ”

and leave us hanging, ” Abbas Jinna said, appealingly.
 “
We need to know what happened next, ” Sam Nai-
doo cut in.
 “
We are not moving from here, Tata. We’re going to 
sit right here until you finish the story, ” Mohan Govender 
insisted. “Y ou don’t really think we can walk home with-out hearing the rest of this great girl’s life. ”
 “
Y ou boys can sit here all night, for all I care, ” Soo-
bry Pillay shot back. “I have a family to get back to. ”
 “
But Tata!!!” they all chorused in unison. And then 
they saw him smile, saw the mischief in his eyes, and knew that he was teasing them.
 “
Y ou boys come here tomorrow. And I’ll educate 
you tunsels – you rascals. But remember now, tomorrow is Sunday, so you can only come at ‘session’ time, twelve n o o n .”
 “
And you’ll close at two, and in that time you will 
be busy with your customers. How much can we learn in that short while?” Abbas asked disconsolately. 
 “
That’s the law, my boy, as it applies to us Indians 
and Coloureds. Don’t let it bother you. We will end up right here, in this room, and I’ll make sure there’s enough food for you to stay awake. ”
 “
Nothing will keep us away, Tata. And you can be 
sure we will be wide awake, ” Mohan said firmly. “This kid, Valliamma, she’s one bristen bok. I want to know all about h e r.”
 B
y two in the afternoon the boys had all settled 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   25 2011/11/01   1:59 PM26
The Agony of Valliammacomfortably in the backroom, and were chatting amongst 
themselves whilst they waited for uncle Soobry to lock up. 
 “
This ‘session’ business is a lot of crap!” Mohan 
said. “We can drink only if we buy a meal, whether or not we are hungry. We can’t enter a pub before twelve and have to be out by two.  And it applies only to us darkies. The witous can booze all day, in luxury lounges, and don’t have to order chow either. It’s just a racket to fleece us!”
 ‘
What are you complaining about?” Abbas smiled. 
“Uncle Soobry is the head honcho here, he’s in charge of the Indian section and he settled us charous in the back here, and damned comfortably too. ”
 “
Listen, both you guys, ” Sam said to Mohan and 
Abbas, “Uncle Soobry doesn’t like slang – like ‘bok’ and ‘bristen. ’ Y ou okes know that, so watch out or you’ll get the rough end of his tongue. ”
 “
Nothing bad about those words, but point taken, 
boet, ” Abbas responded amicably. “ And here he comes. Let’s hope he continues with the Valliamma story and doesn’t tell us to buzz off. ”
 S
oobry Pillay headed directly for the kettle and 
switched it on. As he prepared to make himself a cup of tea, he called over his shoulder, “ Any of you like some tea? Come and make it yourself. ”
 “
Tata… ” Thumba cried appealingly, “ All we want is 
to hear about Valliamma – “
 “
Patience, my boy. That girl was a saint. She turned 
her world on its side, like no one had done before. And I have to be sure that when I talk I don’t insult her memory. 
 “
In every generation there comes a leader, a savior, 
who leads the people to glory. Valliamma was the trail-blazer in her time. She mobilized society – especially the women - to stand tall and proud of their lineage. Where such a young girl received her inspiration is a mystery. 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   26 2011/11/01   1:59 PM27
The Agony of ValliammaThere are those who say she was saint-like, blessed by 
a higher power. Some say the midwife, herself a saintly lady, saw the greatness in her at birth. Who really knows? What we do know is she had guts, the courage to face up to tyrants and not back down. ”
 S
oobry had poured the tea into his cup and now sat 
back into his favourite chair, his face reflective. “That was a time … a period in our lives, when taking on the bru-tal laws and standing up for human rights, black rights, could cost you your life, and it often did.
 “
I want you boys to remember something, for as 
long as you live. Evil, by its very nature, cannot last. But you have to make an effort to destroy it. Don’t fall into the trap of believing that somehow, not of your own do-ing, everything will come right. That would be stupid, like building a boat where there is no water. Valliamma knew this, she didn’t have to be told. ”
 S
oobry paused to gather his thoughts, then took a 
long sip from his cup before continuing. The young men around him were spellbound, hardly daring to breathe. “It was a time when evil ruled this land, when the gods were sleeping, as if, having given us Valliamma they had no need to do anything more… ”

The Agony of ValliammaChapter Five
Johannesburg. 1908.
 A s
mall group of people had gathered at the en-
trance to the prison, waiting for Thambi Naidoo to 
emerge. Several armed policemen, bristling with revolv-ers and rifles, faced the tiny crowd. Valliamma was right at the front, shouting at the top of her voice: “SHATHAM PRATI SATYAM” – truth against a rogue.
 Th
e assemblage took its cue from her, chorusing 
in unison, “SHATHAM PRATI SATYAM! A few added, “God’s name is truth!”
 “
And truth will triumph, ” Ally roared.  
 “
Y ou, Gandhi, ” a senior police official screamed, 
“Take your rabble and get the hell out of here. We have instructions to shoot you if you pursue this unlawful pro-test. Go! NOW!”
 “
This is a peaceful demonstration, ” Gandhi an-
swered, softly and reasonably. “We are passive citizens and we are not breaking the law and have no intention of attacking anybody. This is a public place and we have every right to be here. I assure you we will leave quietly as soon as our comrade walks out of that gate. ”
 “
Y ou have instructions to shoot us?” Valliamma 
demanded, “even though we are causing no disturbance? Who gave you the instructions? And are you saying you need our permission to murder us? Y ou do what you have to do. And we will do what we have to do. ‘Shatham Prati Satyam. ’ That is the law we live by. Y ours is a sick law. We do not obey evil laws!”
 Th
e leader of the police force was stumped. If he 
took violent action, with Gandhi at the receiving end, there would be an international outcry. And experience had taught him that he would be blamed by his own sen-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   28 2011/11/01   1:59 PM29
The Agony of Valliammaiors, as they scuttled to save their necks. If he did nothing 
he would be seen, by the same bosses, as a weak leader. 
 W
hilst he wavered uncertainly he was rescued by 
Thambi Naidoo, walking boldly out of the prison gates. The protesters were cheering loudly. For the moment the pressure was off him. In that moment, he watched Val-liamma closely, taking careful note of her appearance. His time will come, he swore to himself, and he’ll break the little bitch and obtain revenge for his humiliation.
 “
Even as I step out of prison, ” Thambi Naidoo 
smiled warmly, “the first face I see is this little girl, leading the way. ” He hugged Valliamma effusively, then turned towards Gandhi and Ally, “Well, dear friends, can we go somewhere and get a hot cup of tea and something to eat. I’m famished. ”
 A
s soon as Thambi had showered and borrowed 
fresh clothes from Ally, they settled around Ally’s table. Valliamma asked Thambi Naidoo, “Tell me what it’s like in there. Do they feed you?”
 “
That, my dear, is the least of our problems when in 
jail. But why do you ask?”
 “
I need to know what to expect, when they take me 
in. ”
 “
When they take you in? Y ou’re convinced that will 
happen?”
 “
Y es. I saw the way that policeman looked at me. ”
 “
Valliamma, you don’t want to end up there. It is 
beyond terrible. When people talk about hell on earth, that place is it.
 “
It’s vermin infested, cockroaches crawl all over you 
and often you have to fight off rats that are as big as cats. Its bitterly cold in winter and the only covering you have are the fleas that crawl over your body. Y our body itches constantly, and you only sleep in snatches. And there is 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   29 2011/11/01   1:59 PM30
The Agony of Valliammano one you can complain to. The moment you open your 
mouth they shove the barrels of their guns down your throat.
 “
And as much as that may shock you, there are 
worse things that happen in there. Y ou are continuously walking in your own faeces and…look, let’s not talk about it now. I wanted to look presentable when I go home. I didn’t want to shock my family. I have to go to them… ”
 “
Y es, ” Gandhi added. “Nothing is more important 
than family. Go and reassure them. ”
 “
Before I do that…Valliamma, you have your en-
tire life before you. Pursue your studies. The Resistance will take care of itself. ” 
 “
What do you know of how long I have to live! I 
may be young but I see our people’s pain. And some of our leaders…they keep saying they have a vision for our future. I’m not sure what they are seeing, but I hear them laughing. It angers me. I’m not sure whether they love power or the people, especially when they find the battle for liberty amusing!”
 “
Y ou had better go now, Thambi, while you still 
can, ” Gandhi cut in with a smile. “This girl, she’ll end up becoming your siren song and, as the Greeks say, lure you onto the rocks. I can only pray for more like her. ” 
 “
Like I once told you, Mohanbhai, ” Ally smiled 
back, “Y ou only need two more like her and the war will be over. ”
 Th
ambi chuckled loudly, “Y ou two say she is my si-
ren song. But you are both like the Ancient Mariner, and if I don’t get out of your clutches now I’ll be hooked for life. ”
 “
Go with God, good friend, ” Ally said warmly. “We 
meet tomorrow, to plan the way forward. ”
 “
And make sure I’m there, ” Valliamma butted in. 
“This is not your battle only. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   30 2011/11/01   1:59 PM31
The Agony of Valliamma “ That child… ” Gandhi said to Ally as soon as they 
were alone, “She makes me feel sorry for our enemies. I would hate to suffer her enmity. ”
 “
If we ever win this contest, it will be the likes of 
Valliamma that will make it happen. ”
 “
It’s strange that you say that. I feel this child is not 
interested in winning or losing – as long as justice tri-umphs eventually. I don’t understand, though, how some-one so young can be so wise. ” 
 “
It is a benefaction from God. There is no other ex-
planation. With wisdom comes courage and she has a lot of that. ”
 “
She certainly does! And she doesn’t know the 
meaning of fear. ”
 “
Look, Mohanbhai, I am convinced that she is not 
of this world. And she dotes on Thambi – our ‘old offend-er’ as he is affectionately called. And he takes the govern-ment on at every turn, which gives her even greater en-couragement. ”
 “
Thambi is the greatest of our satyagrahis. The 
greatest liberation fighter this country, or any other, ever produced. I’m convinced that without his presence the Passive Resistance movement would have crumbled. It’s good that he mentors the child. I fear for her. She has a huge following, perhaps even greater than my own. We have to find a way to protect her from the government’s lackeys. ”
 “
She will never agree to any form of protection. She 
is hell-bent on provoking the authorities, is actually dar -
ing them to lock her up. I think it is her way of exposing our rulers to the world. ”
 “
I agree with that summation, my friend. There is 
some divine power that guides her. Of that I am certain. 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   31 2011/11/01   1:59 PM32
The Agony of ValliammaAnd when she tells the crowds that our leaders seem to 
preach rather than practise I can’t help but agree with her. I’m not sure that even I am not guilty of that failing. What concerns me intensely, though, is that our people must not be incited to the point where they resort to violence. I acknowledge that an unjust law is itself a species of vio-lence. Arrest for its breach is more so. Violence should be resisted not by counter-violence but by non-violence. This I do peacefully by submitting myself to arrest and imprisonment. ”
 “
No one can accuse you of lacking morality, my 
brother. Y ou are the originator of satyagraha, you taught us to mobilize and stand firm. Without the likes of you and Thambi, the Resistance would fade away. And now, I am convinced that Valliamma will inject a new impetus to the movement. It worries me, though, when she says that she is not of this world for long!”
 W
ithout looking up from the ground, which he 
seemed to be contemplating, Gandhi commented, “What will be, will be. I’m intrigued by what she will do next. Don’t be surprised if she turns our world upside down. She is way ahead of all of us when it comes to forward planning. Mark my words, this country will never be the same when she finishes her mission. ”
 “
I don’t doubt that. And she can make that happen 
anytime now. ”
 “
We cannot lose control, ” Valliamma was saying to 
her companion as they crossed over the street on their way to school. “Our people are dying in jail. Their chil-dren are dying in their decaying houses because there is no one to care for them. It has to stop. I will stop them. Later today we must go to the Tamil Benefit Society and arrange to feed the hungry and the starving. Over the next few days, if our schooling has to suffer, so be it!”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   32 2011/11/01   1:59 PM33
The Agony of Valliamma “ Valliamma… ” her friend, Nagappen, said softly, 
“What’s going on there, across the road? Some old man is being beaten up by the police and… ”
 V
alliamma was already sprinting across the road, 
her face furious. “Hey, you, ” she called out long before she reached the scene, “leave him alone, he is old and weak. Stop! NOW! Y ou big bully!”
 “
Shut your face, coolie!” the tall and burly consta-
ble shouted back, “ or you will get a bit of the same. Y ou bloody Indians, you think you own this land!”
 “
We do own this country, you filthy tyrant. And 
your time will soon come! I warn you, stop beating this poor man. ”
 “
Y ou warn me? Y ou cheeky bitch! I’ll throw all of 
you in jail till you rot like rats. ”
   V
alliamma had stepped in between the policeman 
and the bleeding old man, protecting him with her body. And then a miraculous change seemed to overcome her, she appeared to grow taller, menacing, projecting an au-thority that transformed her into a fearsome adversary. 
 “
Shatham prati satyam, ” she pronounced, so softly 
that the officer had to lean forward to hear her. The first two fingers of each hand were extended and pointing at the man’s face, her upper body leaning forward. “The truth shall set us free. ”
 I
t was at that moment, when he leaned forward to 
hear what she was saying, that the thug looked into the girl’s eyes for the first time. And he froze. An unknown fear coursed through him, immobilizing him. Something, some searing power emanating from her, chilled him to his core and he involuntarily shivered. What he saw in the girl’s eyes was his own death.
 “
Go! Back to your hole and leave decent people 
alone, ” Valliamma repeated, in the same soft and un-threatening voice. “Move!”

The Agony of Valliamma Th e browbeaten ruffian shuddered, then started to 
tremble. He took a backward step, then another, began to retreat, and then turned around and fled across the road.
 V
alliamma bent down and helped the old man to 
his feet. As he slowly rose, she asked, “can I help you? Maybe get some water?”
 “
No, beti, I’m fine, ” he replied, breathing heavily. 
“This has happened to me before, often. I’m used to it. But what did you say to that man to make him flee… ”
 “
Why was he beating you?” Valliamma asked, not 
unkindly, ignoring the question.
 “
He asked me for money. I laughed, because I don’t 
have a penny. That made him angry. ”
 “
What is your name, Tata?”
 “
Amod. Just Amod. ”
 “
Can I take you home?”
 “
Home? The gutters are my home, child. They took 
my house away from me a year ago. It was a nice house. My father had built it with his bare hands. Then the whites came and threw our furniture and all of us onto the street. Now they live in my house, ” he added bitterly.
 “
And your family?”
 “
They are at my brother’s house, in Claremont – 
Pretoria. The place is a ghetto and my brother is not rich. So I stay here, looking for some work. But who will give an old man like me a job. ”
 “
Y ou come with us, father. The Tamil Benefit Soci-
ety will feed you and give you a bed to sleep in. ”
 “
Y ou are kind, beti. God will bless you. ” 
 “
All I want is the strength to break them! When 
that is done, God can do what he likes with me. ”
 Th
ambi Naidoo looked angrily at his close friend, 
P .K. Naidoo, and exhorted him to move swiftly to rein Valliamma in. “They will eliminate her, P .K. She doesn’t

The Agony of Valliammaknow the meaning of fear. We have to get her to slow 
down. She is our trump card when we lead the march to Parliament. The people will follow her to hell. ”
 “
Nobody can stop her, Thambi. And you should 
watch your own back. Their hit squad will soon come for y o u .”
 “
I have to do what I have to do. And to hell with 
the hit squad! Our people are in pain, constantly. That old man that Valliamma brought here yesterday, it broke my heart to hear his story. His is not an isolated case. The hor -
ror is a daily occurrence, repeated a dozen times. I have to take on their grief. Watching my back is not my priority. ”
 “
And when they kill you?”
 “
There are others who will take over: Y ou, H.O. 
Ally, Cachalia, Gandhi, Sorabjee, Rungasamy…the list is endless. How can I live if I desert the cause?”
 “
I’m not asking you to do that. We have both been 
in jail. I’ve lost track of the number of times. And you know that they are coming for you again, possibly today. ”
 “
I have been in jail for longer than I have been out 
of it. What will change?”
 “
What will change? Y ou are our greatest leader, the 
people’s hero. We need you. ”
 “
And I say we need Valliamma. Our people love 
her. I may win a battle but she will win the war. ”
 “
Thambi, my good friend, we can’t change the flow 
of history. Events will take their own course… ”
 P
. K. was still talking when Nagappen barged in 
on them and said, breathlessly, “That policeman, the one Valliamma faced up to, came to her house an hour ago. He was screaming for her, and he had a large number of his friends with him… ”
 “
What? What did you say?” P .K. cut in furiously. 
“They beat her up?”
 “
No. She was not at home. They took her mother

The Agony of Valliammaand father away. ”
 “
We have to get to Valliamma, ” Thambi said ur -
gently. “There’s no telling what she will do now. We must 
find her and get Gandhi to go with us to the police sta-tion. We must move fast, before Valliamma takes matters into her own hands!”

 “
Uncle Soobry, ” Mohan said slowly, his eyes 
half-shut and his jaw clenched tightly, “We know noth-
ing about all this. Y ou are right! We are ignorant of our early heroes, men like Thambi Naidoo, H. O. Ally, P .K. Naidoo and the others. And we had never heard of Val-liamma. Why? Why were we not told about those things? We knew about Gandhi and I always thought it was him alone who… ”
 “
Cut the cackle, Mo, ” Abbas said. “I want to hear 
about what Valliamma did when they picked up her par -
ents. ”
 “
We all do, ” Sam added. “Don’t stop now, Uncle 
S o o b r y.”
 “
I like that you should know your history, ” Soobry 
said, unhurriedly. “But I hope you don’t think this is a fairytale, something to keep you occupied and amused when you have nothing to do. ”
 “
Y ou know, Uncle Soobs, ” Abbas replied solemnly, 
“We, all of us here, feel that nothing has changed. We are still treated by the cops like dirt. So we stay close to the casbah, where we call the shots and we can disappear into the alleys when they raid our areas. We hate their guts. They’re scum! But they have the guns and that gives them the muscle to push us around and harass us. But we have never taken this government on. We have never confront-ed their sick laws. So when we hear about Valliamma we feel courage and a kind of pride in her spunky confronta-tion of our common enemy. ”
 “
Abbas is right!” Sam interjected firmly. “We made 
the mistake of treating the government’s muscle men with a contemptuous respect. We have never defied them, let 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   37 2011/11/01   1:59 PM38
The Agony of Valliammaalone challenged them. That girl, Valliamma, makes us 
ashamed of our weakness and lack of commitment. ”
 “
She makes me feel like a coward, ” Mohan said soft-
ly, “like I’m a little skaapie that anyone can push around. ”
 “
But…Uncle Soobry… ” Thumba asked, “How do 
you know so much about the politics of that time, espe-cially in Johannesburg? We know you never lived there and from what you told us, it was all before your time… ”
 “
Y ou boys are educated, ” Soobry said. “But your 
education was controlled by orders from the government departments and politics was expressly forbidden in your schools. I didn’t have much education, but I knew right from wrong. And I read a lot, all the books I could get hold of. But they were mainly novels and nothing was written about Valliamma in any of them. And then, when I was forced to leave school and work here, my formal education ended.
 “
But I read all the papers that the customers left  
behind. And my mother, she was not only my tutor but also one of our greatest historians. She used to work here, in the kitchen. We had very little money, so she got me a job here as a scullery boy. I was fourteen at the time.
 “
It was the best thing that could have happened to 
me. There are those who will say my mother was not edu-cated. Well…she couldn’t read or write English but she was a Tamil scholar and historian. And because we were together for most of the day, she gave me a running com-mentary on the developments in our country and told me about Valliamma, not just once but over and over. She gave me every detail of that child’s life and made certain I stored it in my mind. I appreciated that only much later, after she was gone.
 “
Y ou must not forget that she lived in that time, 
when Valliamma was active. But this is not about my life. Let me tell you more about that remarkable child… ”

Doornfontein. 1908.
 
W
hen Valliamma walked through the door the first thing 
that struck her was the silence. The usual clutter of pots 
and pans as her mother worked was totally absent. And the flimsy door had been wide open. Although nobody ever locked their doors in the township, often leaving them open for the neighbours to walk in at their pleasure, it was not normal for the houses to be left unattended and unoccupied. Instinctively, she knew that something was amiss. She was still gathering her thoughts when Minachee, who lived a few doors away, walked in. “The police were here earlier. I’m not even sure that they were the police. They were a rough bunch and behaved in a violent way. They were looking for you. ” 
 V
alliamma inclined her head, listening attentively. 
“They were screaming like wild animals and they messed up your house. When they realized that you were not here they took your mother and father away. ”
 “
Did they hurt them?”
 “
No. But they behaved very rudely… ”
 B
efore Minachee could finish Thambi Naidoo, 
Gandhi and H.O. Ally came over and Thambi said, con-solingly, “Y ou mustn’t worry. Nagappen was here when the dogs came. He told us what happened. We are on our way to the police station. P .K. is already there. ”
 “
I’m not worried. Appa and amma have been in 
and out of jail very often. But those men were looking for me. I must come with you. I’m concerned that they will torture my parents if I’m not there. ”
 Th
ey will do that anyway, Ally thought to himself, 
but only replied,  “Y ou can come along if you insist. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   39 2011/11/01   1:59 PM40
The Agony of Valliamma “ I deal with these people daily, ” Gandhi added, 
“they know me and I’ll obtain access to them. Let us han-dle this. ”
 “
We’re wasting time, ” Thambi cut in. “Let’s go!”
 “
We are not interfering with your work, gentle-
men, ” Gandhi said reasonably. “That couple is innocent. We want to avoid trouble. If our people out there hear about this you will have a riot on your hands. I’m meeting with General Smuts tomorrow. I would like to put this behind me before then. ”
 Th
e motley bunch of uniformed officials, bristling 
with anger, suddenly went quiet. They were aware of Gan-dhi’s influence with Smuts. None of them wanted to be accused of underhanded tactics. And they knew that they had no case against the Mudliars. Their pride, however, didn’t allow them to capitulate easily.
 “
This girl, ” one of them, a burly individual, pointed 
towards Valliamma and bellowed, with false bravado, “is a trouble maker. She can’t be allowed to continue stirring your people to rebel. And you, Thambi, you are a rabble-rouser too! Y ou can all go to Smuts and say what you like. He will listen to us and accept what we tell him. ”
 “
My friend, ” Gandhi replied dispassionately, “We 
have no intention of saying anything about today to him. Nor will we mention your names or anything about this incident. We are being reasonable. We’re asking you to help us to avoid wasting the General’s time on such petty matters. If you wish to charge this couple for any reason, that is your prerogative and you are not answerable to us. For now, let us all go in peace. It is not much to ask for. ”
 Ga
ndhi was allowing them to save face and extri-
cate themselves from a predicament that was entirely of their own doing. 
 V
alliamma was on the verge of saying something, 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   40 2011/11/01   1:59 PM41
The Agony of Valliammaof objecting to Gandhi’s pacifist stance, when Thambi qui-
etly took her aside and whispered, “Let Gandhiji handle this. Our concern now is for your parents. When they’re out of here, you can decide what you wish to do. And I’ll back you up. But for now, please… ”
 V
alliamma nodded, and whispered back, “that man 
that Gandhiji is treating with so much respect, he is the one who beat up the old man, uncle Amod. I know that policeman. He hates me! But he fears me too… ”
 “
And that makes him dangerous, ” Thambi Naidoo 
said softly, ensuring that only Valliamma could hear him. “Leave it for now. When we are away from here we will talk about it. ” 
 “
All we do is talk, and then talk some more, ” Val-
liamma complained to the men around her. We must take some firm steps… ”
 “
Listen, my girl, ” Gandhi said, “I acknowledge and 
respect the fact that you are only ten years old. I am also fully aware that you have the brain of someone twice your age. But you haven’t yet experienced the brutality that this government is capable of unleashing. I have been subject-ed to its barbaric savagery. And Thambi here has been to jail more than a dozen times, for simply standing up and peacefully denouncing it. Y ou don’t need that at this stage in your life. ”
 “
Are you telling me that fighting for the truth is 
only for a grown up?”
 “
I’m saying that you are too valuable to the people 
out there. Ending up in jail will only harm the cause, slow it down. We can’t risk that. ”
 “
Y ou are revered by those same people, for your 
brave stand. I see it as a noble fight. Why should my life be more valuable than yours?”
 Ga
ndhi was stumped. Dear God, he said to him-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   41 2011/11/01   1:59 PM42
The Agony of Valliammaself, how do I reason with this child. And yet, everything 
she says is perfectly sensible. How can one so young be capable of such profound wisdom. It can only be a gift  f rom  You .
 “
Y ou have not answered me, uncle, ” Valliamma 
said, cutting into Gandhi’s thoughts. Tell me where I’m wrong and I’ll do the right thing. ”
 “
It isn’t about you being right or wrong, ” Gandhi 
replied, then turned towards Thambi Naidoo and Ally, spreading his hands helplessly and seeking their partici-pation. “Perhaps I am missing a point here… ”
 “
If I may… ” Ally said, choosing his words carefully, 
“I think I know where your anger comes from, Valliam-ma. Y our parents have been very active in the Resistance, from long before you were born. They have been subject-ed to the regime’s brutality perpetually and incessantly.
 “
As a result, after you were born there must have 
been many times when you were cared for by neigh-bours and friends. Y ou sensed, in those early days of your life, that your mother and father were continually being thrown in jail and forced into hard labour and that it was not because they had committed any crimes, but simply that they had the courage of their convictions.
 “
Y ou must have witnessed the pain in their faces 
each time they returned from prison, their bruised and broken bodies hanging limply in their torn clothes. Y ou may even have ministered to their ailments. And you surely shared in their agony. 
 “
It was a devastating period in your life. Y ou are 
not wealthy people. Y our father toils as a hawker, earning barely enough to keep the home fires burning. And yet, the two of them have been in the forefront of the battle for liberation, crusading for our people’s freedom and hold-ing high the banner for justice. 
 “
How, whenever they were in prison - and they 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   42 2011/11/01   1:59 PM43
The Agony of Valliammawere locked up for six months at least on each occasion, 
and that was very often - you managed to protect and feed your younger sisters is a miracle in itself. But it hardened you. It is the source…the origin, of your convictions.
 “
So, from the very first breath you took, those ear -
ly experiences were the fountain that created what you are today. They fortified you. And that, my dear, is what makes you into the person you now are - your lineage... you have been  programmed to fight injustice wherever you see it.
 “
It is an admirable quality but it could also be what 
destroys you in the end. ” 
 “
That is a very accurate assessment, ” Thambi Nai-
doo confirmed, addressing Valliamma, “and it also ex-plains why you chose the route of peaceful resistance rather than violent protest. It was ingrained into you by your parents and you learned that responding to savagery with barbaric and inhuman behavior was not the civilized way. Y ou automatically chose the non-violent way of op-posing the tyrant.
 “
All of us support that route. Indeed, Gandhiji has 
been promoting it almost since he first arrived in our country. What we are now saying is that such methods require a certain sophistication, the ability to fight back peacefully without a display of hatred or inculcating ha-tred in the oppressor. Y ou, my girl, need to refine that av-enue and learn from that philosophy. ”
 V
alliamma, her neck inclined slightly to the side, 
was listening carefully to the opinions enunciated by both Ally and Thambi Naidoo. And the more she heard, the more the crease in her forehead lessened. Towards the end of Thambi’s statement she had begun to nod her head, implying acceptance of their estimation of the influence that her parents’ principled stance had had on her own development.
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   43 2011/11/01   1:59 PM44
The Agony of Valliamma “ If I may intrude, ” Gandhi stepped in with his usual 
courteous manner, “I am not privy to your early life. But I do know your mother and father well. They’re always in the frontline of the Resistance. They are diehard and resolute in their opposition and unwaveringly dedicated to the cause. They have no money but are rich in integrity and morals. 
 “
It is patriots like them that motivate my own com-
mitment to the struggle. They affirm my belief that whilst our country is colonized, as long as our minds are free we will eventually obtain our freedom. What we have to guard against is the danger of allowing them to colonise our minds!
 V
alliamma, paying careful attention, even at that 
age was aware and appreciated that she was being tutored by three of the greatest men of her time. 
 “
My own country, India, ” Gandhi continued, “is 
subject to a regime not unlike what your country is expe-riencing. And the people there are resisting the invasion t o o.”  
 Ga
ndhi then turned towards his companions and 
added, “The tiny island that has usurped our wealth and now rules our land, together with the majority of little countries in Europe, have colonized the rest of the world and abrogated to themselves the wealth and production of those colonies. 
 “
Their people enjoy the highest living standard an-
ywhere on earth. Their luxurious lifestyle is the result of those ill-gotten gains, looted from the more civilized na-tions of the world. They can bask in it for a long time but it is the product of demonic and immoral actions, evil in the extreme. 
 “
The citizens of those villainous lands can remain 
in denial for a long time, feigning ignorance of the source of their prosperity and opulence. But someday they, or 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   44 2011/11/01   1:59 PM45
The Agony of Valliammatheir descendants, will be held to account. Evil, by its very 
nature, cannot last forever. 
 “
Sadly, some of the people in those countries may 
not have contributed to the vice, but they can’t deny that they enjoyed the gains derived from such depraved pro-ceeds. Their karma, ” Gandhi concluded, “will certainly manifest itself in the years to come, on that you can de-p e n d .”
 “
I’m not prepared to suffer until someday their kar -
ma catches up with them, ” Valliamma said quietly, hold-ing back the anger. “The time is now, today. I am their karma, and I’m knocking on their door!”

 “
That girl, Tata, ” Mohan Govender said admir -
ingly, “was one vilt chick. ” 
 “
Vilt chick?” Soobry snorted. “Why don’t you boys 
speak English? A chick is a bird. Y ou eat the pieces I fry 
and place on the counter. And some of you are studying to become doctors! What are you going to do? Eat your patients?”
 “
Well, Tata, ” Mohan chuckled, “the world has 
moved on…language changes…all I was saying is that she was a tough cookie… ”
 “
Not here! Not in my bar! And what is this about 
cookies? Y ou mind your language or go elsewhere. ”
 “
Okay, Uncle Soobs…uh Soobry… but tell us the 
rest of Valliamma’s story. Did she really go and neuk the government?”
 S
oobry Pillay threw his hands up in the air. “neuk? 
What is neuk? Maybe it was a good thing I didn’t go to school… ”
 “
It was the best thing that happened, ” Abbas said, 
with conviction. “We wouldn’t have known about Val-liamma and her gutsy stand if you hadn’t spent time here with amma. ” 
 “
Y es… But it’s funny how, whenever I talked about 
that girl, nobody wanted to know. Now it’s Valliamma, Valliamma, Valliamma! Y ou boys, what you will do with it? With her brave story? Y ou now tell me that the world has moved on, but how can you move on if you don’t know who you are, who were your heroes? How can a country become great if it moves on but forgets its past?”
 “
Hey, Tata, ” Sam Naidoo grinned, “Y ou’re a philos-
opher too. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   46 2011/11/01   1:59 PM47
The Agony of Valliamma “ And our historian, ” Thumba added. “Educate us, 
time we learned about our yesterdays. ”
 “
Y our yesterdays are your tomorrows, son. ” Soo-
bry said solemnly. “But only if you know where you come f r o m .”
 “
Our problem, Tata, is that today the government’s 
spies are everywhere, listening and reporting everything we say. Some of them are our own people. ”
 “
Y ou won’t find them here, kanna, not in my place. 
One look and I know them. A second hard glance and they run fast and shaking like they saw their own ghost. I have been here all my life, I know everyone, I recognize sellouts before they even open their mouths. ”
 “
How come you’re not scared of them, Uncle Soo-
bry?” Abbas asked.
 “
Because I fear ignorance more than prison. And I 
don’t talk a lot. I listen and I learn. ”
 “
Well…you’re certainly talking today, and we’re lis-
tening. ” 
 “
But are you learning? Any fool can listen, that’s 
why you have two ears. But you have to stand up for your rights, and for that you must use your third ear – your mind. That is how you really learn. Are you able to do that?”
 “
We’re getting there, ” Sonny Murugen laughed, 
“Like they say in the bios, Rome wasn’t built in a day. ”
 “
And this is Soobry’s bar, not Rome or the bioscope. 
Here you learn fast, or you’re out. ”
 “
Oh, we’ll learn, for sure. But will we follow in Val-
liamma’s footsteps? Learn by her example?”
 “
Y ou want to get somewhere, you have to move. Just 
listening is not moving. How different is our world from the time when Valliamma was fighting for us? We are still tenth class citizens. We still jump when they shout. Val-liamma shouted and they jumped! 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   47 2011/11/01   1:59 PM48
The Agony of Valliamma “ Gandhi did that, Mandela did that, Kathrada, 
Monty Naicker and Yusuf Dadoo did that. Even our wom-en, like Fatima Meer and Goonum did that. And they shouted loud and clear, boy. They didn’t jump for nobody. How about you? Y ou waiting for someone to teach you? Maybe you think jumping is good for your legs!”
 “
We’re putting food on the table, Uncle Soobry, ” 
Sonny started to say when Soobry cut in, “Look who walked in. Hello Billy. How you doing?”
 “
Vannakam, Soobry. ” Billy Nair smiled. “I’m still 
ducking the damned Security Branch. But what’s with these lighties? They look like they saw a ghost. ”
 “
They did, ” Soobry laughed. “Their own. ”
 “
Y a? How come?”
 I
’ve been telling them about Valliamma. They want 
to know all about her. ”
 “
Only now? What were they doing all this time?”
 “
Hustling, Billy, ” Sonny replied. “But you should 
know that, ya?”
 “
Sure, my boy, sure. If you guys had the same op-
portunities in the marketplace as the Whites, you wouldn’t have to do that. ”
 “
We make our own markets… ”
 “
Y a…the blackmarket racket, ” Soobry teased.
 “
Why not? We don’t force anybody to deal with us. 
They don’t like what we sell, they’re free to chuck. And it’s a business, like any other. Those cinema tickets that we offer on premier nights…we outlay a stack of marcher for them. Sometimes we end up with a whole bunch that nobody wants, because the cinema doesn’t have a ‘House Full’ sign. And then we carry the loss, sometimes a huge one. Why they refer to it as ‘black market’ tickets is unfair and makes me furious.
 “
And, as any business, we create employment. Our 
runners, the guys who see to the customers’ needs in the 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   48 2011/11/01   1:59 PM49
The Agony of Valliammagambling schools, the hustlers, they’re all earning an hon-
est living. They don’t go around mugging people and hi-jacking them. ”
 “
If you don’t already know it, Billy, ” Abbas added, 
“our guys live a lot better and earn more than those mis-erable guys that graft in those shops in Grey Street. Don’t talk to me about rackets until you know who the real racketeers are – “ 
 “
Easy, boet, ” Billy cut in pleasantly, “I know how you 
guys operate. Even the Fah-Fee racket, the Bank – as it is famously referred to – is nothing more than the identical numbers game that is now a legal enterprise controlled by organisations connected to the government. They call it the Natal Lotto and the law doesn’t hassle them. So cool it, boys. Nobody is accusing you… ”
 “
Let’s talk about Valliamma, ” Sam urged. “We are 
hooked on that girl and her courage. ”
 “
That’s your field, Soobry, ” Billy Nair said encourag-
ingly. “Continue from where you stopped when I walked in. ”
 “
Y es… well… It was two years later, around 1910, 
when Valliamma really got into her stride… ”

Johannesburg. 1910.
 V
alliamma knew instinctively that she was being 
followed. The hair on the back of her neck was bristling. 
And, at a point between her shoulder blades, she felt a sensation similar to the feeling induced when a finger is pointed close to the spot between the eyes.
 D
on’t allow them to scare you, she told herself. 
Their only strength is your fear. Conquer that and they’re helpless. And don’t turn around. Continue to pretend that you are unaware of their presence. Let them make the first move. 
 S
he was still debating her next response and urging 
herself to remain calm when someone grabbed her by the shoulder and roughly turned her around.
 “
Remember me, bitch! I’ve waited a long time to get 
you alone in a quiet place. It’s time to break your bloody pride!”
 V
alliamma immediately recognized him. It was the 
man who had assaulted Amod because the elderly and feeble gentleman didn’t have any money to give him.
 “
My pride is what I am. Aren’t you proud of your -
self? Do you hate yourself or the work you do?”
 Th
e hard slap twisted Valliamma’s neck, almost 
forcing her to her knees. A drop of blood, from her up-per lip, trickled down her chin. Her attacker was grinning delightfully, his fingers bunching as he readied himself for the next blow. “I’m your Moses, you little cow!” he screamed, when a tall Zulu, burly and brawny, suddenly stepped between them and demanded, “Hau! She’s a little girl. Why you hit her?”
 V
alliamma’s tormenter rose to his full height, try-
ing to intimidate her savior. “Fok off, kaffir! I’m a police-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   50 2011/11/01   1:59 PM51
The Agony of Valliammaman. I’ll lock up your black arse if you don’t start run-
ning. ”
 “
Lock me up? For telling you not to hit a child? Big 
man like you? Try hitting me!”
 V
alliamma’s assailant went red in the face, his eyes 
blazing, “Y ou talk to me like that? To a white man? Y ou cheeky piece of shit! Y ou’ll pay for this!”
 W
hile the two men were locked in hostility, Val-
liamma quietly intervened, resorting to the gesture that had, on their previous encounter, reduced the ruffian to a quivering coward. She raised her hands in front of her, the index fingers pointed directly at the tyrant’s eyes, im-mobilizing him in his tracks. The pupils in her eyes nar -
rowed to pinpoints, her upper body leaning forward, her shoulders hunched. Throughout the motion, she had re-mained silent.
 Th
e effect was instantaneous. The thug took a back-
ward step, then another, before strutting away, his body stooped and no longer intimidating.
 “
Hawubo, ntombi! What you do? Why he suddenly 
ran away?”
 “
Nothing, baba. I just looked at him. But thank you 
for protecting me. Y ou’re an angel. ”
 “
No, little girl. I’m just a man. And we have to stand 
together, keep an eye on each other. When they come with their army we can’t fight them, but when they alone, like all cowards they run away. ” 
 “
Y ou must come to my house, baba. And meet eve-
ryone. I live in Doornfontein. And tomorrow there will be a protest rally, to shake our rulers up. Can you come? And bring your family and friends?”
 “
For sure. I know Doornfontein and some people 
t h e r e .”
 “
Okay, just ask for Valliamma. Everybody there 
knows me. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   51 2011/11/01   1:59 PM52
The Agony of Valliamma “ Where do you meet so many people?” Thambi 
Naidoo asked. “That man you just introduced me to…do you know who he is? That’s Big Boy Tshabalala, the un-derworld don. In this town you don’t sneeze without his permission. Even the police keep away from him. ”
 “
He is the man I told you about earlier. He saved 
me from that bully yesterday. ” 
 “
Y ou are lucky that he happened to be on the scene. 
That policeman, he’s just a rookie cop. Tshabalala has got that man’s bosses in his back pocket. Y ou’ll be surprised to know that your savior is also a political activist. The only chaps that can touch him are the government’s spe-cial team of enforcers. They can’t be bought. And they’re ruthless. Once they begin to hunt you down you can be sure your time is up. ”
 “
My time was up on the day I was born. If I have to 
run each time those thugs come looking for me I may as well stop living. ”
 “
But there is no need for you to confront them. Do 
what you have to do, just keep your distance and stay away from them. There is a time to face up to these animals and a time to draw back. Knowing the difference is the way to engage with your opponents. ”
 “
Such a battle could go on forever. ”
 “
That’s where you are mistaken. Minor victories 
weaken the enemy and undermine his resolve. He be-comes vulnerable. And that is the time to strike him, once and for all. ”
 E
ven as she listened to Thambi Naidoo advising 
her on tactics, Valliamma’s eyes were everywhere and now she was frowning, staring at a spot directly across from her and a short distance away. Something didn’t look right. “Uncle Thambi, what is going on there? That group of protesters…they seem to be scattering… ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   52 2011/11/01   1:59 PM53
The Agony of Valliamma “ The government’s dogs are here!” Thambi spat, 
“they’re out in full force and harassing those poor people protesting peacefully. Come, they need our support. ”
 Th
ey were about a hundred yards away when they 
noticed that the women were beginning to disperse and a ring of policemen, armed with rifles and revolvers, had surrounded the remaining contingent of supporters and were barking instructions to them to disband and move on.
 I
gnoring Thambi’s cautionary cry, Valliamma 
sprinted across the square and began to exhort the wom-en to go back and not allow themselves to be intimidated. Thambi came striding through the crowd of demonstra-tors and confronted the arrogant official perched atop his prancing horse, his sharp features and smiling face at odds with his contemptuous expression. “I know you, you little skelm! I’m going to lock you up for inciting the peo-p l e .”
 “
Y ou are the one causing this disturbance. These 
people are not threatening anybody. Leave them in peace. ”
 Th
e imperious official, looking self-important and 
haughty, flushed with anger and signaled to a few of his troopers to come over. “Take this bloody coolie and lock him up. I’ll break his black backside later. ”
 Th
ere was a sudden lull in the crowd, the noisy ob-
jections stilled by the threat to imprison Thambi. A few of the protestors were murmuring angrily, refusing to be intimidated by the high-handed policeman’s threats. 
 “
Damned ruffians!” H.O. Ally shouted, grabbing 
the reins and attempting to dislodge the rider. “Y ou think you can terrorize us with impunity. Y ou only increase our determination  – “
 Th
e frightened horse, unused to rough handling, 
neighed loudly and reared on its forelegs. Somehow, not without great effort, the official maintained his seat and 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   53 2011/11/01   1:59 PM54
The Agony of Valliammasummoned his men to come to his assistance. “Break the 
bastard! Tie him to your horse and pull him all the way to the station. ”
 A
nd then, before the lackeys could respond to their 
orders, the heavens suddenly growled, the clouds became dark, the sky roared with thunder and rain threatened to pour down in buckets. The horses began to snort in fear. In the confusion, Valliamma grabbed Ally’s hand, pulled Thambi away from the furious guards, dashed towards the milling crowd, and merged with the swarming throng of disarray.
 “
Y ou tell me to be careful, ” she hissed, “and to keep 
my distance from these ruffians. And then you walk right into them. And you’re supposed to be veterans! On the one hand you advise me to bide my time, to wait for the right moment, and then do exactly the opposite. ”
 “
Circumstances dictate our actions, ” Thambi said 
breathlessly. “Let’s get out of here. The recriminations can come later. ”
 “
If the seven gods of luck spare us till then, ” Val-
iamma panted.
 V
alliamma, her chest heaving with exertion, low-
ered herself on the worn sofa and addressed the two men, surprised at the anger in her own voice. “Never again! I will not run from them even if they fire their guns at me, ” she gasped. And then, for the first time since she had been a baby, she wept. “This has to stop, ” she started to say, but her voice broke as she began to sob.
 “
Y ou were brave, my girl, ” Ally said softly, “Y ou 
saved us from certain disaster. Y ou displayed great cour -
age in the face of grave danger. Thambi and I are indebted to you”
 E
ven to Valliamma, her voice sounded unfamiliar 
when she replied, “Y ou owe me nothing. I need no reas-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   54 2011/11/01   1:59 PM55
The Agony of Valliammasurance of my courage. I will follow Lord Krishna’s exam-
ple when he led his people into battle. He was only cour -
teous in victory. And until we are victorious, I will engage the enemy with vengeance. If that means dying for what I believe in, so be it. ”
 Th
ambi sighed. “It is not a simple matter of life and 
death, my dear. This is about politics. We have to master the game, the way it is played. Victory comes with plan-ning, not sacrificing our lives. ”
 W
hile the men debated the rules governing pro-
test, Valliamma stood up and, in a voice as soft as melted butter, said, “Y ou do it your way. I will follow my own conscience. We all want our people to be free. For  that I will do all I can. That will be a greater victory than sacri-ficing my life. ”
 On a s
teamy Saturday afternoon, in the middle of 
November, four men sat around Thambi Naidoo’s dinin-groom table: Gandhi, Thambi Naidoo, H.O. Ally and P . K. Naidoo were planning the way forward when Ahmed Cachalia and Parsi Rustomjee walked in.
 “
That child, ” Cachalia said to no one in particular as 
he lowered himself into a chair, “makes me feel ashamed of my moderate responses. I now hear that she is mobiliz-ing the women to prepare to march from Tolstoy Farm to the Natal border. It’s a certainty that they will end up in jail, not only for the illegal march but also for not having a permit to leave the Transvaal. ”
 “
She has to be restrained, ” Thambi insisted. “This 
is not the time for that. It will happen, certainly, but we must advise her to hold back, until the movement is stronger. At this point in time, it will be a waste of energy and achieve little. ”
 “
Another year, perhaps a little longer, would be 
perfect, ” P .K. Naidoo added. “But will she listen to us? She 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   55 2011/11/01   1:59 PM56
The Agony of Valliammahas always been headstrong. And the people out there 
adore her. ”
 “
We all do, ” Ally interjected. “However, I agree 
that she is her own person, motivated by her own beliefs. Swaying her resolve is like trying to stop the sun from shining. Impossible task!”
 “
I will speak to her, ” Gandhi softly suggested. “She 
has to be approached with reason and a good case for her to delay her decision. I have found her very amenable to a logical proposition. She may be headstrong, but she is not foolish.That is what makes her into our greatest asset, a natural born leader. ”
  
W
hen Gandhi walked into the Mudliar’s humble 
home, Mangalam smiled warmly and invited him to sit in one of the only two chairs in the house. He sat across from her as she draped the top of her sari decorously over her hair.
 “
I have come to see Valliamma, ” he said respectful-
ly. “I must speak to her about this mission that she wants to engage in, her march to Natal. It will be most danger -
o u s .”
 “
She will be here in a minute. But don’t hope for 
much. That child, she has a mind of her own. Nothing and nobody can influence her. ”
 “
I understand. And I am proud of her. Both you 
and your husband have been active satyagrahis for a long time. And you paid the price. Indeed, you spend more time in prison than you do here, in your home. I can see where she gets her courage and her motivation. ”
 “
Thank you. We see it as our duty, our birthright. ”
 “
It is a noble mission and it is what makes the In-
dian in this country so outstanding and heroic. ”
 Ga
ndhi had stopped to catch his breath, when Val-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   56 2011/11/01   1:59 PM57
The Agony of Valliammaliamma stepped through the door and raised her hands to 
her face. “Namaskarum, father. It’s nice to see you. ”
 “
The pleasure is all mine, ” Gandhi smiled. “Now 
grant me one more, a simple request. ”
 “
If I can…I will be honoured. ”
 “
Can we talk about your planned march to the Na-
tal border?”
 “
Y ou don’t want me to proceed?”
 “
I’m going to try and dissuade you. At this stage it 
won’t be wise – “
 “
Y ou can relax, then. I have already deferred it to a 
later date. Would you like to know why I did that?”
 “
Y es, please. I’m delighted by your decision. ”
 “
I must warn you though, that I have only post-
poned it, for a much greater march. ”
 “
Hai Ram!” Gandhi exclaimed. “I should have 
known better. For a moment it sounded too good to be t r u e .”
 “
What I can’t believe is this new bill that Smuts is 
busy putting together. In December he passed the ACT OF UNION and in a few weeks, on the 31st May, he will declare the Union of South Africa. It is totally racist, ex-cludes all people of colour from calling themselves citi-zens of this country and – “
 “
Valliamma, my girl… I know the details and I 
have objected strongly to the way the new Constitution is structured. I’m due to see Smuts next week… ”
 “
Smuts does not interest me. The man is a racist 
and arrogant. And the British parliament will back him all the way. It’s up to us to resist this evil. It is not an In-dian thing, all of us that they call non-whites must stand together. ” 
 “
How do you know what the British parliament 
will do? 
 “
I listen, and I remember. ”

The Agony of Valliamma “ And you plan to do what? March on Pretoria?”
 “
Y es. My supporters are ready. Our walk starts to-
m o r r o w.”
 “
It’s a long way… ”
 “
A long way to where? Pretoria or freedom?”
 “
I believe freedom is a gift from God. Pretoria is 
just a place, the center of government. ”
  “
If Smuts succeeds in passing this despicable law, I 
intend writing to the Queen of England. ”
 “
Saying what?”
 “
That Smuts’ Constitution is an act against human-
ity. I will write that I object to people of colour being ex-cluded from being citizens in the country of their birth. ”
 “
I should have thought of that. I feel I learned 
something today, by just talking to you. Y ou go ahead, with your protest rally and the letter. Be sure, though, that they will throw you in jail – “
 “
Y ou’ve been in jail so very often. I can only emu-
late you, with pride. ”
 “
I am proud – of you! God bless you. Y ou are the 
true face of my satyagraha movement. ”
  
Th
ey had gathered once again at Ally’s house. Gan-
dhi had just returned from the visit to Valliamma.
 “
That child, ” Gandhi said to Ally, “is immortal. The 
word ‘fear’ is not a part of her vocabulary. ”
 “
She fears God, ” Cachalia interjected. “Not many 
people can honestly say that these days. ”
 “
Well… ” Thambi commented, “I know she believes 
that doing God’s work is why she was born. ”
 “
I don’t doubt it, ” Cachalia said with conviction. 
 “
So, Gandhiji, are you saying you failed to dissuade 
her?” Rustomjee asked.
 “
It was the most satisfying failure of my life. And 
did I tell you that she is even targeting the queen of Eng-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   58 2011/11/01   1:59 PM59
The Agony of Valliammaland? Valliamma plans - I suspect she thinks the queen is 
accountable for Smuts’ actions - to write a letter of protest to her. ” 
 “
The queen had better watch out, then, ” Rustomjee 
chuckled.  
 “
This March that she is planning, ” Ally mused, “She 
has Smuts in her sights. Y our friend, Mohanbhai, is the one who should watch out. ”
 “
There is much about Smuts that is admirable. He 
is fighting for his people, who were brutally victimized by the British. His is also a noble cause and we must respect that. His error is that, in the process, he ignores the rest of humanity. But he is a reasonable man, always courteous and understanding. We must not judge him harshly or unfairly. The only difference between the two of us is that he is concentrating on the liberation of his people – the Afrikaner. I am concerned with all of humanity.
 “
That may be so, ” Thambi Naidoo added softly, “but 
Smuts is the author of that disgraceful Constitution, de-grading all people of colour and reducing them to a dis-gusting and shameful level. I cannot, will not, treat him with respect. I intend fighting him to the end, even if that be my end. ”
 “
I understand and sympathise with you, my good 
friend. But anger and hatred is not the way to approach him. And the word ‘fight’ must be removed from our vo-cabulary. Negotiating, in good faith and love, is the only road to success. ”   
 “
Valliamma has never shown any tendency to vio-
lence, ” Ally said, “both her parents, and she herself, have always behaved with strict adherence to your teachings of Satyagraha. She will fight the good fight – peacefully. ”
 “
That child… ” Thambi muttered, “…is too tall for 
her age. People often mistake her height and assume she is an adult, and treat her accordingly, and perhaps un-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   59 2011/11/01   1:59 PM60
The Agony of Valliammafairly. ”  
 “
It pains me when our children are brutalized, ” 
Gandhi brooded. “They are imprisoned, tortured, and 
emerge from jail with broken bones and scarred bodies. Recently I attended the funeral of a young satyagrahi, Na-gappen. His body was bruised and covered in welts. He had died of pneumonia and heart failure, barely six days after his discharge from prison.
 “
And if that shakes you, can you imagine Valliam-
ma’s reaction? She was present at his funeral, she saw his broken body. They were childhood friends, he was at her side during every rally and protest march. What went through her mind when she looked at what had been done to him?” 
 “
And yet, Gandhiji, ” Thambi complained, “Y ou ad-
vocate a conciliatory stance against the very animals that indulge in such fiendish and savage acts… ”
 “
Y es! Indubitably. Violent responses only beget 
greater violence, and everybody gets hurt. There is no al-ternative to reasoned remonstrations and rational behav-ior. Debate is preferable to destruction. It is the only way, the civilized way, to deal with outrage and humiliation. ”
 “
And if logic and reason fail to correct the prob-
lem?” Ally asked. “ And, as in our case, only encourages the oppressor to commit greater atrocities, how are we to respond to that?”
 “
Walk away. Y ou can be sure it will get him think-
ing and reconsidering his actions. And even if it doesn’t correct his behavior, the guilt is his, not yours. All I am advocating is that you do not reduce yourself to the level of your opponent. ”
 “
Do you think Valliamma is operating by those 
principles?”
 “
Undoubtedly. And she didn’t need me to tell her 
all this. It wells from deep inside her, some inborn impulse 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   60 2011/11/01   1:59 PM61
The Agony of Valliammathat will not allow her to obey unjust laws. The key here is 
her methods – she responds by demonstrating peacefully. A quality I have immense admiration for. ”
 “
I must consider joining her on her march to Pre-
toria, ” Ally said.
 “
And I, ” Thambi added.
 “
We will all join her, ” Gandhi proclaimed. “It is the 
least we can do. It is our contest too and, of course, the core of satyagraha to which all of us are committed. ”
 “
We are being led by a child, ” Ally quietly observed, 
the awe in his voice unmistakable. “Where did we go wrong? Why did we fail so miserably?”
 “
Y ou do yourself an injustice, good friend. The 
contribution all of you here have made to the cause is leg-endary. It makes me proud to say I am an Indian. ”
 “
I’m afraid Valliamma will disagree, ” Ally laughed 
pleasantly, “she sees herself as a South African. ”
 “
I must warn you, though, ” Gandhi added, very 
softly, to allow his message to sink in. “Three of you here are extremely wealthy men. They’ll break you, reduce you to penury… ”
 “
Gandhiji, ” Thambi Naidoo replied, equally courte-
ously, “That has already commenced. Both Ally and Parsi Rustomjee here will tell you that our businesses are suf-fering. And Ahmed Cachalia here is paying a bitter price for his defiance of the authorities; they have closed down many of his most lucrative ventures. We’ve reconciled ourselves to that. ”
 “
Poverty doesn’t seem to have reduced Valliamma’s 
convictions. We can do no less, ” Cachalia added, some-what flippantly. “Compared to the price she is paying, our troubles are insignificant. ”
 “
I’m happy to hear that, ” Gandhi said, “but a word 
of caution. This State can be very vicious. It will tear you apart, and vilify your wives and children too. It will lay 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   61 2011/11/01   1:59 PM62
The Agony of Valliammainto all of you, brutally. ”
 “
Nothing of true value can be obtained cheaply, ” 
Cachalia scoffed. “There is a price to be paid for every-
thing. And, without freedom, what good is wealth? What can it buy that has greater significance? And Thambi is already paying the price. Even as we speak, 17 members of his family are in jail – simply because they spoke up for their rights. ”
 “
I bow before you, ” Gandhi humbly acknowledged. 
“Y our descendants will celebrate your sacrifices. And so will future generations in this country. What each of you and Valliamma are doing will never be forgotten. ”
 “
We are mature adults. Valliamma is a child, ” 
Cachalia said diffidently, “but she displays a greater cour -
age than all of us put together. ”
 “
She operates on a higher moral plane, ” Thambi 
Naidoo added  impassionately, “all things considered. ”
 Ga
ndhi was about to say something when there was 
a tap on the front door, followed by several loud knocks. Ally excused himself, opened the door, and looked at the visitor enquiringly.
 “
My name is Vusi Tshabalala, ” the strapping man 
announced. “May I speak with you?”
 A
lly had not seen the man before and hesitated for 
a moment. There was something impressive and confi-dent about the visitor’s manner, without a hint of aggres-siveness.
 “
I am a friend of Valliamma, ” the caller announced. 
“I have some bad news. ”
 “
Please come in, ” Ally said welcomingly. “I hope 
she is okay. ”
 “
She’s fine, depending on your viewpoint. ”  
 A
lly led the way to his sitting-room, saying, “I 
thought you said you had bad news?”
 B
efore Tshabalala could answer, Thambi Naidoo 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   62 2011/11/01   1:59 PM63
The Agony of Valliammastepped up and smiled, “Well, the big boss himself! We’ve 
met at a few rallies. ”
 “
Y ou’re Thambi Naidoo. ”
 “
I’m honoured that you remember me. But meet 
the others. ”
 Th
ambi introduced each of the men, starting with 
Gandhi. As soon as everybody had shaken hands, Ally asked, “Y ou said you have bad news?”
 “
Y es, ” Tshabalala answered, then seemed to hesi-
tate, before bluntly announcing, “They’ve arrested Val-liamma. ”
 Th
e men were stunned. Gandhi was the first to re-
cover. “Where is she being held?”
 “
My boys are trying to find out. But I saw them as 
they rushed off with her. They were brutal.
 “
Did they say anything? Did you hear them say 
what they were charging her for?”
 B
efore Tshabalala could reply, P .K. Naidoo burst 
out, furious, “Can they arrest a child of that age? Are they gone completely crazy? Would they have done that to a white kid?”
 “
That ‘child’ , ” Tshabalala said with a chuckle, “makes 
my toughest fighters look like cowards.. Do you want to hear what she was saying as they led her away? ‘What took you so long… ’ And then she held out her hands to be cuffed. That little one has more courage than anyone I know. And that is saying something!”

 “
The lousy sonsabitches!” Abbas was outraged. 
“That kid makes many of our so-called toughies look like 
99 pound weaklings. These okes run when they see the cops!”
 “
Tata, ” Mohan added, softly and with a hint of ad-
miration, “that was one gutsy broad. Where did she get her courage from?”
 “
Y ou boys haven’t been listening!” Soobry protest-
ed, looking frustrated. “What have I been saying all day?”
 “
We’ve been following you, dad, ” Sam said, placat-
ingly. “Everything you’ve been saying, we will never forget it. It’s just that…this girl, a twelve year old, was something else. We have never heard about her. Her life, her sacri-fices, her opposition to unjust laws, leave us in awe of her. And it makes us feel guilty too! Like…you know…we’ve failed her memory. She was a freedom fighter who – “
 S
oobry, his face expressionless, cut in decisively, 
“Okay. Alright. But you boys miss the point. Valliamma was not, far as I’m concerned, a ‘Freedom Fighter. ’”
 “
But Tata… ” Abbas complained, “Y ou have been 
saying that she fought –“
 “
Y ou boys have missed the point entirely, ” Soobry 
snorted. “Valliamma was a true follower of Gandhi. A confirmed satyagrahi. She was no ‘freedom fighter’; She was a peace activist. Are you mukus capable of telling the difference.
 “
Go easy on them, uncle Soobry, ” Billy Nair sug-
gested respectfully. “These boys are trying to get to grips with a world that is alien to them. But the fact that they’re outraged by what you told them, that alone is to their credit. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   64 2011/11/01   1:59 PM65
The Agony of Valliamma “ Any fool can be outraged, ” Soobry snorted. “But 
actually standing up for his rights and suffering without complaining, that is true courage. These lighties, they strut around the streets like they own them and don’t re-alize that they are no more than slaves, even today, to the system. ”
 “
Okay, lekker, uncle Soobs, ” Abbas said, raising his 
hands in surrender. “But we can learn from you. And to-day we all admit we are receiving a great historical les-son. We can appreciate that. And that is something our schools never taught us. None of our teachers even men-tioned her name. ”
 “
Y ou forget, my boy, ” Billy Nair said, “The teach-
ers then, and even now, are completely intimidated by the Education Department, the holy cows who make the rules. If you deviate, even mildly, from the set syllabus, you’re out on the street and will never be able to teach again. Our teachers are strictly monitored by govern-ment-appointed inspectors, and those guys are The Law. Our guys don’t dare step out of line – they too have to put food on the table. ”
 “
Y a, well, we graduated from the University of 
Hard Knocks, ” Sonny grinned. “Politics was not a subject taught to us. ”
 “
Y ou think that was tough? Do you know what our 
teachers were truly subjected to by the government? The torture that some of them were threatened with if they didn’t obey official policy?”
 “
Torture, Billy?” Sam asked, outraged.
 “
Y es! And I’m referring to the physical stuff, pain 
like you lighties never experienced. And probably never will. ”
 “
How do you mean physical?” Sonny asked. “Y ou 
telling us they were neuked by the inspectors?”
 “
No. The Inspectors were okay – mostly. They only 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   65 2011/11/01   1:59 PM66
The Agony of Valliammahad the power to make - or break - a teacher’s career, to 
recommend promotion to a higher level, or to demote them. The real grief was when the political cops got on to them and hauled them off to their detention centers. ”
 “
Y ou’re joking, ya?” Mohan asked, disbelievingly. 
“I’ve never heard of a teacher that was hucked to some place and snayed by the kerels. ”
 “
That’s because you left school early and took no 
interest in your teachers’ life after that. ”
 “
Billy… ” Sam mumbled, his voice almost inaudi-
ble, “I get the feeling that we’re missing something here…something we know nothing about… ”
 “
Y ou got that right, son. But that is not exactly 
your fault. The really appalling and outrageous omission was…is…the Press. The newspapers help the government to cover up the monstrous cruelty that is still being per -
petrated on our people. Some of them do it out of fear – the government could close them down within hours. But others…well, let’s just say they like what their govern-ment is doing. Prejudice has no conscience!”
 “
Tell us about what happens to teachers when 
they don’t play by the rules. What is the Department’s re-sponse, ” Mohan asked, his curiosity aroused.
 A
nd then, even as Mohan had barely completed 
his question, Billy’s face underwent a remarkable change. His eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened, his fingers curled into fists with the knuckles shining white and the skin stretched taut and hardened. His face reflected a mixture of emotions – pain mixed with grief, eyes blazing with anger, his lips stretched tightly over his mouth.
 Th
e bar had suddenly gone very quiet, even Soo-
bry had stopped polishing the glasses and was looking in-tently at Billy. It was clear that what Billy would say next would be devastating and change their lives forever.
 “
Y ou want to know what happens? When you don’t 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   66 2011/11/01   1:59 PM67
The Agony of Valliammatoe the line? Y ou cease to be human! They reduce you to 
the level of a helpless and blithering idiot! Y ou become an object of their fury and suffer their wrath. They destroy you, boys, like you squash a roach in the gutter. But first they break you, body and soul. And then they throw you out the window. ”
 “
They actually do that, all those things? For simply 
refusing to play ball with them?” Abbas asked, looking horrified.
 “
Y ou find that hard to believe?” Billy demanded. 
“Where have you boys been living? In some cloistered en-vironment where you are protected by your own kind and hear only what you want to hear?”
 “
Ouch, Billy, ” Mohan started to say when Abbas 
gently nudged him in the ribs and silenced him, then said quietly, his voice sounding shocked, “Billy, we know nothing about that world. But we’re not stupid. We hear things – “
 “
Y ou hear things? What sort of things? Okay, per -
haps I’m being unfair. But tell me, have you lighties heard of Ahmed Timol? No? Let me tell you something, about what goes on in the real world…
 “
Ahmed Timol was a teacher. A few years ago – I 
can give you the exact date, it was in October 1971, when he was about thirty years old – he refused to keep to the apartheid - based curriculum that the government im-posed on the teachers. He denounced the regime, showed the world the horrors committed in its name, and became a political activist.
 “
What did the government do? They murdered 
him! But now hear this, you think that was barbaric? They did worse things to him before that – if anything can be worse than murder. They took him to John Vorster Square – that’s the Johannesburg Police Station – and they worked him over. They tormented him, abused him and 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   67 2011/11/01   1:59 PM68
The Agony of Valliammasubjected him to excruciating pain!
 “
And when that failed to break him, they pulled out 
his fingernails, one agonizing finger at a time. His right 
eye was gouged out and his balls were crushed. That was when he contemptuously spat on their faces and they lost whatever sense of humanity still existed – they threw him out of the window of the high-rise building. And you can be sure they did all that without batting an eyelid. ”
 “
They did that?” Sam asked, outraged. “This same 
government that still treats us like rubbish in a toilet and helps itself to our hard-earned wealth?”
 “
Not a government, Sambhai!” Abbas protested 
vehemently. “They’re a bunch of thugs, brutal scoundrels who persecute every darkie and line the pockets of their own people. ”
 “
Y ou want to see how our people, the Africans, are 
forced to live in their shacklands. ” Billy added. “But you want to be fair, Abbas. Don’t taint every White man with the apartheid brush. I already told you, about guys like Robin Cranko, Rowley Arenstein…hell, there were hun-dreds of others… ” 
 “
Listen, you lot, ” Soobry said bluntly, entering the 
debate for the first time. “Don’t ever think that all our own people were fighting the system and denouncing the government. 
 “
My son, Rajan, used to manage the Mermaid res-
taurant in Teacher’s Centre, in Albert Street. On the floor above him were the A.N.C. offices. The chaps from there used to visit the restaurant daily and discuss their politi-cal strategy. So those people – the ‘thugs’ as Abbas cor -
rectly described them – they pressurized my boy to bar them from his place. Rajan bluntly refused, in effect told them to shove off.
 “
It was a mistake, a terrible one. Within weeks they 
destroyed a highly profitable business and reduced it to a 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   68 2011/11/01   1:59 PM69
The Agony of Valliammadump! His crime? He didn’t play ball either. And it was 
our own sellouts that did the dirty work!” 
 “
Our own okes?” Abbas asked, in a shocked voice. 
“Y ou mean charous?”
 “
We know who they are, Abbas” Billy said angrily. 
“There will come a day when they will be called to ac-count! They won’t talk their way out of it. Their betrayal will be exposed to the world. ”         
  “
And in the meantime nothing has changed, ” Sam 
said derisively. “ After over seventy years since Valliamma took the bastards on we are no better off!”
 “
But the struggle goes on!” Billy exclaimed. “ And of 
this I am certain, victory will be ours! It will take time, but it’s assured. ”
 “
I would like to ask Valliamma what she has to say 
about that, ” Thumba Pillay said questioningly. “Wherever she is, I bet she’s pretty disappointed with us. ”
 “
We do our bit, ” Billy said, somewhat diffidently. 
“ And we are aware that we’re in it for the long haul. I re-peat, we will overcome.!“Well… ” Abbas said, “While you okes are doing that I want to know more about Valliamma. What did the cops do to her when they hucked her off to jail?”
 “
She must have given those dogs hell, ” Mohan 
chuckled, though he didn’t look amused.
 “
She did that, for sure, ” Soobry answered confident-
ly. “They couldn’t hold her for more than a few days… ”

 “
Y ou can’t do this, General!” Gandhi said scath-
ingly, looking at Smuts directly in the eye. “Throwing a 
twelve year old child in jail, for protesting peacefully? Can you imagine the reaction of the international communi-ty? Y our country will be seen as the pariah of the world. ”
 “
I assure you, my good friend, I know nothing 
about this. I’ll immediately instruct whomever is respon-sible to release her unconditionally. ”
 “
Thank you. There must be no delay. Even as we 
talk I fear she will be brutalized, mercilessly. ”
 “
Look, Mr. Gandhi, we are not all animals. The ac-
tions of a few must not be held against the government – “
 “
So you do acknowledge that you have a bunch of 
vicious and inhuman hounds out there and that they have to be reined in. ”
 “
What do you want me to say? Every country in the 
world has its black sheep. I’m not saying that we should treat them with a velvet glove. When it comes to my at-tention, like now, I act swiftly. Can any man do more?”
 “
General, your people, the Afrikaners, have suf-
fered cruelly at the hand of the British. Y our women en-dured a bitter persecution barely ten years ago. Y ou per -
sonally led the revolt against that treacherous country. And that was noble of you.  Why is such savagery now manifesting itself in your race? The Afrikaner, the honest man of the land, is not by nature barbarous or heartless. I urge you to employ the same tactics when you deal with my people. They are, after all, citizens of this country and, by extension, your responsibility. ”
 “
I am not unaware of that. Nor do I condone this 
barbarous behavior – “

The Agony of Valliamma “ General, with the utmost respect, the constitution 
of this country, that you are solely responsible for draw-ing up, does not support your sentiments. ”
 “
This is a debate for another time. My priority now 
is to ensure the release of that girl. I will attend to that n o w.”
 “
Thank you for hearing me out, ” Gandhi replied, 
agreeably. “I’ll seek an appointment with you in a few days. For now, God is the best judge. ”
  
Thi
s is not the life I dreamed about, Valliamma said 
to herself. All I ever wanted was to be happy and live with my family, not sit in this filthy place and eat the dirt they give me. Even the rats here must eat good food, they’re so huge and fat! Unlike them I don’t go around biting peo-ple. If asking to be treated decently, the way we treat oth-ers, is a crime for which I must be punished like this, then this world is not a good place.
 A
nd do they think that, if they do this to me, then 
I will keep my mouth shut in future and not tell the peo-ple to stand up to them. Who are the real criminals? Me? Our people? Or this government that treats us like we are animals?
 A
ppa and amma always told me never to stay silent 
when someone is abused, that if I don’t speak up for other people then who will speak up for me? And they too were thrown in jail, very often. They must have also suffered in this place and been kicked around like dogs. It didn’t stop them from fighting back.
 S
he sighed, stretched her legs on the hard ce-
ment floor, and stood up. I wish I could be different, she thought, looking at the floor, and not like a few of my friends who say nothing and play in the sunshine, eat-ing vadeh and drinking tea. No! I can never be like that! I’ d rather be dead… like Nagappen, my good friend who 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   71 2011/11/01   1:59 PM72
The Agony of Valliammawas murdered for saying that the police are killers and act 
like wild animals. Then she shook her head, from side to side…no, not even wild animals kill for fun and torment those that do not torment them…
 W
hen Valliamma heard the sound of keys rattling 
in the lock on the cell gate, she looked up and almost smiled. It was the elderly warder, who sometimes brought her food and water. And placed it gently on the ground instead of throwing it into the cell, like most of the others did. 
 Th
e kindly old man opened the gate and said, “Y ou 
are going home, meisie. Kom, follow me. ”  
 W
hen Valliamma stepped through the prison 
gates, Thambi Naidoo and H.O. Ally, together with Gan-dhi, who had patiently waited all morning for her release, smiled widely, the delight reflected in their eyes.
 Th
ey hugged her, and then Thambi asked, “ Are you 
alright? Did they hurt you?”
 “
They can’t hurt me, ” Valliamma said warmly and 
with certainty. “I don’t submit to savagery. Now, I need to prepare for the next rally urgently. I’ve lost much time!”
 “
There is no containing this revolutionary, ” Tham-
bi laughed. “She spends three days in prison and all she has on her mind is the next convention, to re-group her followers. ”
 “
If fighting for my people means I must go back in 
there, I’ll do it again and without regret. If Sita could stand up so heroically to Ravan and not allow him to abuse her, can I do less? How different is this government in the way it treats our people?”
 “
Y ou subscribe to the highest principles of Ahimsa 
and I can only admire that in you, ” Gandhi said. “It is a quality that is integral to my Satyagraha beliefs. How can I now attempt to dissuade you from your course of ac-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   72 2011/11/01   1:59 PM73
The Agony of Valliammation... How can I even contemplate such a thought?”
 “
Do not even reflect on it, Mohanbhai, ” Ally ad-
vised. “She will do exactly what her mind dictates, and so 
far she has behaved admirably. ” 
 “
Valliamma, ” Thambi Naidoo said somewhat per -
suasively, “Will you at least promise to consult with us before embarking on your next protest venture or pro-ceeding with your plans– “
 “
I’ll do what I believe is the correct thing, ” Valliam-
ma replied decisively. “ And talking is not one of them. The day you prove me wrong I will bow to your will. ”
 “
But you talk to the people, ” Ally smiled to take the 
sting out of his words. “ Are we not the people too?” 
 “
Y ou are more than that, uncle. Each of you is a 
leader and you have been in jail very often. Why did that happen? Because you stood up for justice! I cannot now remain silent out of fear of imprisonment. Doing that will be the end of me! Today I learnt, from the way they treated me in jail, that they are intent on breaking us and burying our bones. Let us see who wins this contest. ”
 “
That child is a visionary, ” Thumbi Naidoo said 
with conviction. “This government is going to bite off  more than it can chew when they make a move on her. ”
 “
I don’t think she knows much about Passive Re-
sistance and legal issues, ” P .K. Naidoo said slowly. “She has this conviction that truth is something that must not be abused and in pursuit of justice she will sacrifice her life. For her, fighting that cause is her life mission. It has nothing to do with her own future or, for that matter, her death. ”
 “
But can this government be so stupid, to actually 
believe that its policies can be rammed down the throats of an entire community and not meet opposition? 
 “
Stupidity has no limits, ” P . K. Naidoo said scath-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   73 2011/11/01   1:59 PM74
The Agony of Valliammaingly. “We have to oppose it and tell this brutal regime 
that their time is up. ”
 “
And before their time expires they’ll make sure 
you and I are in some unmarked grave. It can’t be avoid-e d .”
 “
Thambi, this is not about life or death, it’s about 
breaking the spine of a community. They pass laws re-stricting us to certain areas only, allowing us to deal only in goods approved by them and at a price determined by them. It is no more than a sophistication of the Indenture rules that were first put in place when our people were enticed to come here. ”
 “
So, after fifty years of oppression, nothing much 
has changed. ”
 “
Oh, a lot has changed, my brother. They are still 
trying to reduce us to the level of slaves. What they fail to see is that we are not some illiterate community lacking in knowledge of the democratic system or that we are sim-ply here for the plucking. They didn’t believe that we had the capacity to take their evil system to the international courts and to bring it to the attention of the rest of the world. We proved them wrong, repeatedly and decisively. ”
 “
And they didn’t bank on a Valliamma, ” Thumbi 
chuckled, but there was little humour in it.
 “
It’s an Indian thing. We set great store on justice 
and the rights of man. Why do you think such a large ma-jority of our people is fighting back against this system? They may be doing it peacefully, but there is no doubt-ing their determination. Both Gandhi and, if I may add, Valliamma, are on fertile soil. Defying unjust laws comes naturally to us. ”
 “
P .K., do you think logic will ever prevail and ra-
tional thinking take over?”
 “
On the part of this government? I suspect they 
don’t give a damned about treating us with respect or de-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   74 2011/11/01   1:59 PM75
The Agony of Valliammacency. I believe that they actually hate us. They are con-
vinced, in their mad chase for power and greed, that we will eventually capitulate. ”
 “
Or they’ll destroy us! Is there no hope then? For 
our salvation?”
 “
There is more than hope. So long as we have the 
likes of Valliamma and Gandhi. ”
 “
That girl haunts me. There is no escaping her. 
While most of our people complain about our rulers’ in-humanity, Valliamma responds with spontaneous defi-ance. There is something about her - a lot more than her youth and level of education - that motivates her. It’s as if some inborn conviction spurs her on and feeds her en-ergy to fight back. ”
 “
Whatever. Y ou can be sure of one thing, though, 
she will not back down. And that, my friend, is the point the government is missing. Valliamma knows no fear. They haven’t experienced her determination to rebel against them. That is their greatest error and our greatest asset. ”
 “
Shatam Prati Satyam – truth against a rogue. I can 
still hear her call!”
 “
Appa was looking very handsome today, in a suit 
and tie and a flower in his lapel, ” Valliamma said, her face glowing with happiness.
 “
Our men, ” Mangalam said with pride, “take good 
care of their appearance, when they can afford it. ”
 “
Appa is doing well, then, in his business?”
 “
Well enough. If you paid more attention to your 
responsibilities here instead of leading rallies all day – “
 “
Amma! I don’t believe you said that! For someone 
who spent half your life in jail and refused to give in to evil, how can you even question my commitment… ”
 “
I don’t. Y ou are doing exactly what we taught you, 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   75 2011/11/01   1:59 PM76
The Agony of Valliammaby example and by words. But you have to spend more 
time here, with your Appa and me. ”
 V
alliamma hugged her mother, her eyes moist. “I 
love you both. Y ou are my reason for fighting this evil – “
 “
What’s this then?” Munuswami beamed as he 
walked in, “Love and hugs? And what about me?” he asked teasingly.
 “
Y ou, my dear father, are my hero. And you’re look-
ing very dapper these days. I love everything about you. ”
 Th
ey were conversing entirely in Tamil, their an-
cestral language. Munuswami had made it a rule that in his house and with his family, it would be the only form of communication. English was expressly forbidden.
 “
I love you too, little one. But you must slow down. 
Don’t lose sight of our objective. I hear you talking to the people, telling them to fight back, and my heart expands with pride and I am consumed with emotion. But it also worries me. Some of the things you say, like defying the White man… that is wrong. This is not an Indian against the White thing – you confuse the government with the entire White population and that is not only wrong but against our culture. ”
 “
But, appa, it is the Whites who vote for their gov-
ernment. Are they not responsible for its reprehensible behavior?”
 “
Y es, but by default, not intention. Many of them 
are decent people and they recoil from the way the law is applied. They too despise their rulers. ”
 “
Then why don’t they just throw them out? We 
can’t do it, we don’t have the vote. ”
 “
But it would be a huge mistake to reflect our anger 
and shine it on them. What I am simply saying is that we must educate them, show them the error of their ways. When you succeed in doing that, you not only free our oppressed but you also free the oppressor and everybody

 “
They don’t listen to us, appa! To them we are igno-
rant savages. We are good only if we obey them. ”
 “
Nothing you say can be disputed, and the people 
adore you for it. They will follow you to the end. But be 
very careful, my sweet child, that you don’t set the scene for a civil war. That will hurt everybody, the good and the bad. ” 
 “
I have never called on our people to declare a war, 
or even to resort to violence. That I have learned from you and have always been guided by you. ”
 “
Then listen to me now, when the populace hang 
onto your every word and are prepared to emulate you and support you, it places a great responsibility in your hands. Y ou have to ensure that your words don’t lead to a bloodbath. ”
 “
I am aware of the dangers, appa. I am always care-
ful when urging them to protest that they always emulate Gandhiji’s teachings. But it happens, sometimes, when the police attack old people, that the young ones, angered, wage a running battle with them. How can I stop them? Deep inside me I admire them. ”
 “
Y our mother and I are guilty of the same senti-
ments. When will this stupid government ever learn!”
 “
When we topple them! And then it won’t matter 
whether they learn anything or not. That is when my mis-sion will end. ”

“Soobry, ” Billy Nair said admiringly, “what are you do-
ing here, working as a barman! We need you out there, at our side. The battle is still being waged and I am not sure we are winning. ” 
 “
This is not about me. I’m simply telling these boys 
what it was like, in Valliamma’s time, and the brave stand our people were taking even then. ”
 “
And little has changed! Or perhaps we now have a 
large group of sellouts…our own guys who play ball with the Nats. They are motivated by money, and this govern-ment has plenty of that, more than enough to buy off  those that claim to be our supporters. ” 
 “
I’ve heard some of those scavengers say that they 
are fighting from the inside to get us a better deal, ” Abbas muttered, scathingly. “They go along with those okes, lin-ing their pockets like bumboys!”
 “
I’ve been inside, son, ” Billy chuckled. “ And, even 
in this day, prison is still a hellhole. ”
 “
It didn’t frighten Valliamma, ” Sam Naidoo 
shrugged. “ And I bet it doesn’t scare you either. ”
 “
Oh! It scares me, allright! But I’m damned if it will 
stop me. ”
 “
From what I know, the latest technique the gov-
ernment employs is to ban okes like you from appearing in public –“ Mohan started to say when Billy cut him off  in mid-sentence.
 “
Damn the ban!” Billy exploded. “That’s what Is-
mail Meer always says. They ban him and he defies them by telling the public that the government is a bunch of twits. And he walks around town boldly, daring them to lock him up. ”

The Agony of Valliamma “ Y ou know what I’m hearing?” Sonny Murugan 
said ironically, “Nothing has changed. In over a hundred years guys like you have been fighting for the vote. What has been achieved?”
 “
Y ou will be surprised, son, ” Billy protested. “This 
government is now the pariah of the world. How did that happen? By chance?”
 “
Hey, Billy, ” Sonny laughed, “No offense meant, 
b r o.”
 “
And none taken. I’m quite impressed with you 
lighties, you ask the right questions and demand answers. I salute that. ”
 “
We also do our bit, ” Sonny added, “When you 
guys ask us to go to the wit areas and break a few windows to distract the cops from your meetings, we’re not slow to act. We may not be political animals, but we know right from wrong. ”
 “
And I’m the first to acknowledge it!” Billy asserted. 
“Perhaps you could do a bit more, but I accept that you have to make a living too. In any event, everything helps. ”
 “
We never did care much for the witous, ” Mohan 
stated, somewhat disdainfully, “They climb onto the bandwagon… ”
 “
Whoa, my boy. Go easy on that. Guys like Rowley 
Arenstein, Robin Cranko, Ronnie Kastrils and a helluva lot of others put their careers – and their lives – on the line for the battle against apartheid. We owe them, big-t i m e .”
 “
Okay, lekker, ” Mohan conceded. “We know some 
of them, and met a few. But that cherry, Valliamma, she was something else. Uncle Soobry, how about telling us more about her?”
 “”
Cherry?” Soobry snorted. “What cherry? Are all 
the girls you know nothing more than ‘chicks’ and ‘cher -
ries’? Are they some kind of food? Okay. Alright. Don’t

 Th
ambi Naidoo appeared  to be defeated and de-
termined, simultaneously. He had just received news that 
Valliamma was in jail, again. He had lost count of the number of times she had been incarcerated and was be-ginning to lose hope that their rulers would ever change for the better. If anything, they were becoming more bru-tal and vicious. In despair, he had just lowered his head on his desk when he heard a knock and then the sound of someone opening the door.
 “
Y ou can relax, ” P .K. Naidoo smiled as he walked 
in. “Valliamma is back at home. She’s hurt, in physical pain, but still bouncing. ”
 “
It will take more than imprisonment to break her 
back, ” Thambi sighed with relief and immediately perked up. “Those vermin infested dungeons can’t alter her re-solve. The problem is this girl can’t be contained. She is steadfast in her belief that this government is evil and must be toppled. I fear she will be taken apart by our rul-ers – she is constantly exposing them, daring them to lock her up. She has become a great threat to them. ”
 “
Do you remember, Thambi, about two years ago, 
when we were on Tolstoy Farm?”
 “
Can I ever forget? Veeramal reminds me daily 
about that rustic place. We learned to be independent, self-sufficient, on that dusty farm. We spent many happy days there, with our children and the others. ”
 “
My wife talks about that place too. She is con-
vinced that Valliamma refined her stance when she flitted in and out of there. How she got there is a mystery. She must have walked through the day and the night to visit us and all she was interested in was the way forward. I 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   81 2011/11/01   1:59 PM82
The Agony of Valliammacan’t recall ever seeing her curled up somewhere to rest 
from her arduous journey and restoring her energy. ”
 “
And I can picture her, haranguing Parsi Rustomjee 
and Ahmed Cachalia, demanding that they take the lead once more and nagging Gandhi to get out of there and be more active. ” 
 “
How about Imam Bawazeer? His wife and daugh-
ter Fatima gave the poor man no rest. The good Imam didn’t have peace even when he was on his mat, crying to God for justice. ”
 “
I still laugh when I think of that. But we received 
an excellent grounding there too. Gandhi took the brute out of us and instilled his philosophy that he loves and honours any man who treats both friend and foe with re-s p e c t .”
 “
And while he was doing that, and the women were 
in the farmhouse kitchen, Valliamma was hauling huge drums of water from the wells and carrying them, pain-fully and one at a time, to the homestead. That girl, she was a tough little one… ”
 “
And dedicated to bringing our rulers down, at 
whatever cost to her own health. ”
 “
I loved the way that she, before setting out once 
more, early in the morning, after a simple meal of beans and roti, waved gaily to whoever was awake at that time. It was like…having done her job she would come back again… ”
 “
That, my dear Thambi, was then. She is now quite 
the veteran – in and out of jail, at the head of every protest march, encouraging those that can hear her to strike… ”
 “
That word ‘strike’ resonates deep within me. It fer -
mented in my mind for a long time but I never got around to propagating it. Now I’ve just heard that Valliamma is planning a defiance campaign to encourage all workers to go on a ‘one day strike’ and not turn up for work. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   82 2011/11/01   1:59 PM83
The Agony of Valliamma “ Y ou can be sure that she won’t stop there. The ‘one 
day strike’ will lead to a ‘one week’ strike. She is hellbent on bringing our rulers to their knees, totally disregarding her own health and life. ”
 “
What has been worrying the life out of me is that 
Valliamma has a huge following. Our own wives and chil-dren are right behind her, and they will follow her to the ends of the earth. My own Veeramal and my entire family swear by her. ”
 “
As do mine! Can we even think of slowing them 
down?”
 “
No! Never. Y ou and I have paid the price for our 
principled stance. We know the horror of imprisonment. Our wives and children emulate us. How can we now ob-ject. ”
 “
Indeed! And why should we? We no longer fear 
death. If we slow down now our descendants will spit on our graves!”
 “
And why should it bother us? Whatever the out-
come, we will leave a legacy of free speech for future gen-erations. That in itself is a great achievement. ”
 “
Well, dear friend, at least in death there is finality. 
I can’t contemplate living for ever, especially not when I see our suffering. ”
 “
Y es… and Valliamma has elevated free speech to 
the level of a religion. That girl will be our savior. ”
 
 “
When a man doesn’t listen to reason, appa, then 
you have to resort to harsher measures. However much 
we try to reason with this government, its only response is jail and torture. ”
 “
And you must always respond calmly and ration-
ally. Abandoning it will be abandoning civilized behav-i o r.”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   83 2011/11/01   1:59 PM84
The Agony of Valliamma “ I think that they are convinced we will eventually 
lie down and submit to them. I intend to send a message to them, to shake them out of their stupidity. ”
 “
And you’ll do that, how?”
 “
A national strike. Everybody in this country must 
down tools, the cleaners, the mine workers – “
 “
I doubt any Whites will support you. ”
 “
I’m not calling on them. There are enough of our 
own to bring this country to a standstill. ”
 “
That may be true. But how do you plan to go about 
it? Do you have a team… ”
 “
Appa, my team is my people – our people. Next 
week we march, to as many towns and cities in this coun-try. Total work stoppage!”
 “
The people out there, they will certainly respond 
to your call. And I am proud of you. ”
 “
We have received information that a group from 
Phoenix in Durban are ready to head for the border be-tween Transvaal and Natal. Their aim is to cross the line dividing our two provinces at Volkrust, in defiance of the immigration laws that apply to us only. I know Gandhiji’s wife, Kasturbai, will be among them. ”
 “
Go with God, then, my dear child. Y ours is a noble 
mission. ”
 “
I’m not sure I’m going with God. But I know that 
He is at my side. ”
 “
As are all of us. But God protects those who pro-
tect themselves… ”
 “
Appa, I don’t need any protection. It is our rulers 
who have to watch their backs. And they will pay for their sins, I promise you that much. I’ll sort them out long be-fore God decides to step in. I am their karma. After that, He can have what’s left of them!”

 “
Gott!, uncle Soobry, ” Sonny Murugen said, “I’ll 
think of Valliamma the next time we tangle with those wit 
gangs on the beachfront. ”
 B
illy Nair burst out laughing, so explosively that the 
beer that he had been swallowing almost spurted through his nostrils. After blowing his nose, he said, “Sonnyboy, you thugs are engaging in gang wars. Valliamma was fighting for justice. There is a huge difference between those two concepts. ” 
 “
Y ou don’t think that we are also standing up for 
our rights, Billy? Y ou reckon we go out there looking for shit? I’ve seen you okes go to the post office and demand that you be served at the White counter. What is the dif-ference between those two concepts?”
 “
The difference, my boy, is that you lighties resolve 
your problems by resorting to violence. Valliamma fol-lowed Gandhi’s teachings – “
 “
Y a, sure. Turn the other cheek! And get your head 
knocked off! Thanks a lot, bro. But my ma didn’t raise no skaapies. They touch our toes, we tramp their faces! And that works a stack better than what you okes have been doing for over a century. ” 
 “
I’m not too sure about that, boet, ” Sam Naidoo 
said, by way of a compromise. “That sounds to me too much like survival of the fittest. Like… you know… ‘you got a gun! I can get a gun too. ’ The only winner is the guy with the biggest gun. ”
 “
Sure, ” Abbas added, “all you end up with is a span 
of dead bodies. I don’t see how that helps. ”
 “
Well… ” Mohan chuckled, “better your dead body 
than mine!”

The Agony of Valliamma Th ey were still laughing uproariously, when Bil-
ly held up a hand requesting silence. “Y ou have to lose someone you love, someone killed violently, you have to stand over his dead body and then ask yourself if there wasn’t a more civilized solution. ”
 “
Gandhi gave us the solution!” Soobry said, out-
raged. “Valliamma lived by that solution. And you lot are still looking for it? Y ou won’t find it by fighting for it with weapons. And one of those dead bodies that you laughed about, it could be yours. Maybe you want to think about i t .”
 “
Come on, uncle Soobs, we’re just speculating 
here. ” Abbas protested. “We are not plotting a revolution. ” 
 “
Okay, ” Sam said, conclusively. “Now that we have 
all identified ourselves, can we hear how Valliamma planned her protest strike? Uncle Soobry?”
 “

The Agony of ValliammaChapter Fifteen
Johannesburg. 1913.
After a simple lunch with Thambi Naidoo’s family, Val-
liamma had quietly escaped into the large yard at the back of the Naidoo home. The need to be alone, to retreat into herself and gather her thoughts, had been overpowering.
 N
ow, as she sat cross - legged on the bare ground, 
her back resting against the trunk of a huge jacaranda tree and her eyes half-shut, she contemplated her future, oc-casionally sighing in frustration. She was aware that her thoughts, entirely in Tamil, with only a passing English phrase, came naturally to her. Well, she reminded herself, that was appa’s influence, his insistence that any commu-nication in our home would only be conducted in our ancestral language, which is as ancient as time itself and a product of our heritage. “Forget your language, ” her father reminded her at every opportunity, “and you for -
get your origins, of where you come from. And then you are no better than a wild animal that knows not where it comes from nor where it is going. ”
 S
he sighed again, heavily. The world is too much 
with me, too soon, she reflected. I don’t play games with friends of my own age. I never go to a picnic or some family celebration. And then she perked up: but I love to dance, especially the Bharata Natyam. But even that, be-cause I am shy, I only indulge in it in the privacy of my own home, when I am alone. 
 S
he raised her head and, as if for the first time on 
that day, noticed that she was surrounded by a verita-ble forest of fruit trees, tiny sugarbushes and flowering shrubs – a haven of peace and tranquility – with only her mind steeped in turmoil. 
 A b
ee buzzed past her ear and she reflected: you are 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   87 2011/11/01   1:59 PM88
The Agony of Valliammafree. Y ou don’t have a care in the world. Y ou fly around 
with total abandon. Apart from drinking from the sta-mens of these flowers and obtaining sustenance, your life is not troubled by the unfair and unjust ways of this uni-verse, the cruelty of your own kind against your own sort. But maybe I’m being unfair to you. Y ou too must have your own fears, from birds of prey and animals, perhaps anteaters and suchlike.
 S
he sensed a movement, then saw a leaf, almost as 
large as her palm, float gently and gracefully through the air and land near her feet. Ah my friend, you have come to provide me with company. Do I really look so lonely? 
 S
he raised her head, pushed her neck back, and re-
lieved the ache in her shoulders. She squinted at the clear sky above her, marveling at the bounty of nature, when, almost immediately, the beauty of the blue heavens was marred by the thought that a storm was brewing. But it won’t come from the sky, she speculated. It will be the people who will rise up and pour their anger on this land of ours – their eyes have dried up from their tears, they have lost their patience. I pray to God that they don’t lose their sanity and that their hatred of our oppressor doesn’t force them to resort to violence. 
 I
t was then that she realized, with a start, that what-
ever the outcome, she had little influence over it. She had experienced mob frenzy on occasions when peaceful pro-testors had been viciously and barbarously whipped by the police and their underlings. Well…she thought impo-tently, if I can’t stop them and avoid chaos, the least I can do is lead them and exhort them to behave in a civilized way. After all, this march, tomorrow, is entirely the result of my own urging. It is now my responsibility. 
 “
Valliamma, where are you!” she heard her mother 
call out.
 “
I am here, here, ” she replied, snapping out of her 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   88 2011/11/01   1:59 PM89
The Agony of Valliammareverie, unaware that she had said it to herself. As she 
rose to her feet, she wondered: but where will I be in the next few days? Will I be gobbled up like that poor bee, by a hawk or some such bird of prey, and end up with my bones spat out over this land? And then she shrugged. It is my destiny. I will be there, where I have to be. My fate is not in my hands, to be decided by me. As it is written, so it will be.
 A
fter a scant meal of beans and a piece of roti, Val-
liamma sat in a corner of the room, some distance from her mother and her friends. She listened to them convers-ing in low tones, planning a protest march to Volksrust and then to Newcastle.
 H
er mother had taught her never to interrupt when 
the elders were talking and Valliamma now maintained her silence, not daring to interrupt even when the burn-ing questions threatened to spill from her lips, demanding answers to the many controversial arguments that surged through her mind. But she listened, attentively and care-fully, keen to examine every allegation and pronounce-ment that the satyagrahis made.
 W
hen Veeramal, Thambi Naidoo’s wife, began to 
speak Valliamma perked up. She knew, from listening to her in the past, that she was a fiery speaker and a leader who feared no one.
 “
The time has come, ” Veeramal firmly insisted, “to 
do something that will really hurt the government and open its eyes. Talking to those people is a waste of time and they don’t listen to us anyway. ” 
 “
I agree, ” Mrs. P .K. Naidoo asserted, by way of sup-
port. “But whatever we do, it must have the people behind us. We have to prove to our rulers that we have run out of patience. ” 
 “
What more can we do?” Valliamma’s mother 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   89 2011/11/01   1:59 PM90
The Agony of Valliammaasked, her voice subdued and sounding defeated. “We 
hold rallies every weekend, we make it clear that we have had enough of their brutality. So far we have achieved very little. ”
 “
But that is exactly my point, ” Veeramal added, in 
her usual reasonable manner. “It is time, Mangalam, to look for other ways to shake them out of their smugness. ” 
 “
Y ou have something in mind?” Baikum Pillay 
asked. “ A different approach… ”
 “
I think I have the answer to that, ” Mrs. P .K. Nai-
doo said. “What will really hurt this government? Put a huge nail into its coffin? It’s a simple solution and I can’t think why I hadn’t thought of it until now! Although, I have to admit, it was Gandhiji that planted the seed in my mind. We must incite the workers to go on strike! That will hurt their pockets and shake their confidence. ”
 V
alliamma sat up, almost jumping out of her chair. 
Y es! she thought, that will really frighten them and be a painful message, like a spur into a horse’s side. And now is the time to do it, while the people are still angry.
 Th
e conversation had, in all that time, been con-
ducted entirely in Tamil. Valliama easily followed the dis-cussion, only occasionally getting lost when some woman added a word or two in Telugu or in some other dialect that she was unfamiliar with.
 “
We will have to discuss this with our husbands, ” 
Mrs. Chinsamy Pillay suggested. “We must draw all of them into our plans, make it a national strike. For that we need their assistance and their participation. ”
 A s
trike! Valiamma exulted, with all the workers 
joining in! I have to be a part of it. I must march with them, be in the front and encourage every one of them to stop working and demand to be treated fairly. And I am sure that Gandhiji will lead us, with uncle Thambi and

The Agony of Valliammauncle P .K. right there with all of us, telling the workers 
that they have little to lose.
 A
nd then, completely unconsciously, Valliamma 
shouted out, “Shatham Prati Satyam! Truth against a rogue. ” When the women looked up in surprise, Valliam-ma hung her head in embarrassment, only to find that all present had responded to her call and, raising their fists in the air, repeated with fervor: “Shatham Prati Satyam!” 
 W
hen her mother hugged her, Valliamma’s heart 
soared with delight and brought tears of pleasure to her eyes. And she silently repeated the rallying cry to herself, glorying in her invention. 
 
 
 “
Do not be afraid, ” Valliamma exhorted the wom-
en that surrounded her. “Be steadfast in upholding your rights, be fearless against this injustice. This government humiliates us. It must be abolished! And always remem-ber, their only strength is your fear. Conquer it and they’re helpless. Now our march begins. Be prepared to be har -
assed. It will be a long trek, there will not be the support we receive here at our homes And some of us will suffer from illness and pain during this journey. We must ex-pect it and face up to it. That is what Gandhiji taught us when he explained the meaning of satyagraha. And they will surely throw us in jail. That too is the price we must pay for freedom. It is a honourable cause, a fight for jus-tice. Are you ready for it?”
 “
Lead the way, ” P .K. Naidoo’s wife replied stoutly. 
“We are not women of straw! They can kill us but they will never break us. We are fighting for our freedom. If death is the price that has to be paid for liberty, we will pay it. And God will exact vengeance, as he always does. ”  
 A
n old lady, nearing the age of fifty, said, “When 
we marched from Tolstoy Farm, to that place – Viljoens-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   91 2011/11/01   1:59 PM92
The Agony of Valliammadrift – many of us carried our babies with us. We made 
sure we broke the law so that we could be arrested. They were too frightened of us and kept their distance. ” 
 “
We dared them to openly brutalise us, ” a young 
girl scoffed. “They were too clever for that! 
 “
I have been on many marches, ” Baikam Pillay said 
loudly. “Those dirty men who pushed us about and put their hands on us, where are they today?”
 “
I was with you, Baikum, ” Lutchmi Pillay called 
out. “Let them come now. They won’t be so arrogant this t i m e .”
 V
alliamma listened with half her mind, the other 
half pre-occupied with the rigours of the epic journey and the outcome of their mission. That first day had gone well, and in most of the towns that they passed through the Indian merchants provided them with food and ac-commodation, displaying the legendary Indian custom of hospitality and concern for travellers.
 A
t night she almost cried when she listened to the 
sounds of rumbling tummies and watched the wom-en moistening their parched lips as they ran their dry tongues into their mouths. She got up often, checked that the satyagrahis were resting, albeit for short periods, be-fore settling down for a brief respite.
 W
atching the bright night sky and marveling at 
the shining stars twinkling above her, she thought: This is how it must have been for the first woman on earth. She must have survived, for us to be here today. And we will survive too!
 O
ver the next few days, drunken pseudo-officials 
cruelly harassed them, demanding to know why they were carrying pangas and axes. Veeramal Naidoo ex-plained that these were no more than wood-cutting tools, to light a fire at night and keep their bodies warm from the freezing weather. Defeated, the rude men asked for

The Agony of Valliammatheir permits and were met with cold stares and a deafen-
ing silence. When one of the men arrogantly asked them to turn back, insisting that they could return only when they had their permits, Valliamma asked, “What will you do to us? We are not going back. Arrest us, if you wish!”
 Th
e official-looking and arrogant man took a back-
ward step, unused to being spoken to in that manner by an Indian - and a woman at that.
 Th
e man then smiled snidely, hinting softly that if 
they gave him a bribe he would overlook their transgres-sions. “Pay you!” Valliamma asked, equally softly, “with what? We have no money!”
 W
hen their tormentor angrily strode off, threaten-
ing to return with reinforcements, Lutchmi shouted at his back, “What for? We are not resisting you. Why don’t you just arrest us! We will follow you peacefully. ”
 “
He won’t come back, ” Mrs. P .K. Naidoo grumbled. 
“Just hold your ground the next time, as you did now. Y ou can be sure we will eventually be taken in. If so, that will be fine. We are on a noble mission. We pursue it to the end or perish!”
 Th
ey stumbled into Vereeniging, some limping and 
nursing their soles by wrapping rags around them. Two of the younger women dragged their feet, their arms hug-ging their chests and their eyes moist. They had both lost their children and were mourning in silence. Others just pushed on, ignoring the excruciating pain and the hunger pangs.
 “
We suffer like this, for what?” an emaciated young 
girl moaned. “Is this the price we pay for our freedom?”
 “
Listen, my sister, ” Valliamma said consolingly, 
“Freedom is our birthright, but we have to fight for it. No-body hands it to you like a lotus flower. When Mr. Kallen-bach, a white man, who is sympathetic to our cause, can march with us, as he has done often - and he is not the 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   93 2011/11/01   1:59 PM94
The Agony of Valliammaonly White person to do so – it motivates us and adds 
to our determination. If we don’t stand up for it now, the generations to come will still be suffering under these un-just laws. The price we pay today will free those that come after us. It is not a lot by comparison. And you can’t place a value on it. ”
 “
And talking about it will achieve little. Our pain is 
nothing!” the elderly woman scoffed. “Our people know this, have lived with it for many years. That time, in Ver -
eeniging, we were taken in by our own. When people like Asvat, Bharoochi and his wife, and others took us in, fed us and gave us decent clothing, they too were contrib-uting to freedom. It was the same in Charlestown, then Volkrust. It was Mrs. Bayat, Mr Munshi, and his friends who took care of us and accommodated us.  The authori-ties harassed us and detained us. In Charlestown our peo-ple enclosed the mosque grounds with tents and gave us food, provided by local Indian traders. But in the end they let us go. What else could they do? They knew we were on a noble mission!”
 “
That journey, ” an emaciated and frail woman in 
her early thirties cried, “was painful. We slept in the open veld at first before we reached Volksrust. Some died, still with their babies in their arms. 
 “ W
hen the police let us go, that was a good thing, ” 
another of the women said firmly. “If they had locked us up in Vereeniging we would not have been here today. If writing petitions, breaking sick laws by hawking to earn a living, telling our people to strike for justice, is a sin, then I’m a sinner. Let God be the judge!”
 “
It has been said that God only helps those who 
help themselves. ” Veeramal said with conviction, closing the subject.
 “
I think we are approaching Newcastle. ” Valliamma 
announced. “We have survived up to now. If we manage

The Agony of Valliammato talk to only one group of labourers, just the miners and 
railway workers, we will succeed in getting them to strike. And then the others will follow. ”
 “
Somebody is coming towards us, ” Bhawani Day-
al warned. “I can’t see him too clearly from here, but he looks like an Indian… ” 
 “
My name is Dawood Mahomed. I have been visit-
ing here with a few friends. We are all Passive Resisters and we have been expecting you. Mister Badat and Vali Peerbhai sent a messenger who rode through the night from Volksrust, to inform us that you were on your way. If you come with me I will take you to the people in New-c a s t l e .”
 “
Take us to the mines and the railways, ” Valliamma 
said. “They are the people we want to meet. And to talk t o.”
 “
Patience, my girl. Y ou look tired, and some of you 
are in great pain. I can see that. Rest for a while, gather your strength and you will be better prepared to address the workers. We have been told all about you and we adore you. Our community in Newcastle is very hospita-ble, they’ll take good care of you. ”
 “
Y es…yes. A short break will be welcome, especial-
ly for our older sisters. But we have nowhere to stay, so we can’t be here for too long. And we have much to do, many towns to call on… ”
 “
Everything has been arranged. A good night’s 
rest will refresh you and you will be more effective when you face the workers. There is a very good doctor and a learned hakim, both Passive Resisters – you can depend on them to minister to the sick. ”
 “
Thank you, father. If you will lead the way… ”
 “
But slowly, my child. Slowly. Joy, and grief, both 
are impostors. Y ou must also prepare yourselves to be 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   95 2011/11/01   1:59 PM96
The Agony of Valliammacruelly harassed by the police – they may even be aware 
of your visit. ”
 “
We are immune to them now. They’ve done their 
worst. What more can they do?”
 “
Y ou know, I met Gandhiji once, not too long ago. 
He told me you were our greatest asset. I’m not sure I be-lieved him then, especially when he mentioned your age. I was wrong to doubt him. Y ou have been campaigning incessantly and you are indeed our most valuable crusad-er, a veteran before your time. ”
 V
alliamma found it difficult to respond to praise 
graciously, although she wasn’t slow to praise others. All she could say was, “My appa always reminded me that Lord Krishna taught us to think of pleasure and pain, vic-tory and defeat…it is all the same thing. I can only stand up for what is right – so that I bring no evil on myself. ”
 “
Y our father is a very wise man. We can all learn 
from him. ”
 Th
ey had been talking as they walked, the others 
close behind them, when their benefactor said, a little loudly so all could hear him, “we have reached our desti-nation. And here is our welcoming committee. ”
 V
alliamma and her companions were speechless. 
They hadn’t expected such a large crowd waiting for them. It seemed as if every Indian in the town had turned out and was looking forward to receive them.
 Th
e merchants of Newcastle, together with their 
wives and families, took the women into their homes and even pitched a few comfortable tents in their backyards. Valliamma and her group were treated like heroes and fed sumptuously, until one of them complained smilingly, “We are stuffed like our mothers-in law, you have tended to our wounds and opened your arms to us. Y ou will all be richly blessed. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   96 2011/11/01   1:59 PM97
The Agony of Valliamma “ God has already blessed us, ” Mariam Seedat add-
ed softly. “He gave us the opportunity to look after you. We can ask for no more. ” 
 “
When you walk out of here, ” Mariam’s daughter 
cautioned, “be on your guard. We have just heard that Bai Fatima, the wife of Sheik Mehtab, Gandhiji’s great friend, together with her seven year old son and her mother, Hanifa, were arrested in Volksrust. They were protesting peacefully. The police treated them very roughly, almost kicked them to the ground, and nobody knows what hap-pened to the son. ”
 “
When they asked her for her fingerprints, ” Ayesha 
Bhayat complained,  “to be included in the charge sheet, she refused. Both were thrown in jail and sentenced to three months hard labour. ” 
 “
This morning we were informed, ” Mrs. Lazarus 
protested, “that Harbat Singh, an old man and a stalwart in the struggle, died in Durban jail. This is just not right!”
 “
Our people are dying every day!” Valliamma was 
outraged. “On our journey we lost several little children. One infant froze to death. Another just fell out of his ex-hausted mother’s arms when she was going across a river. A little girl, tired and freezing in the cold, with nothing to keep her warm, toppled on the wayside and we had to carry her on a rough stretcher to the nearest store. The merchant’s wife took her into her own home, and we were forced to leave her there.
 “
And yet, not one of us complained or thought of 
going back. We were single-minded in continuing our mission. Death is just a short interlude – the struggle goes on till victory is ours! And I assure you we will win! And if some of us die others will take over. The move is on and it is unstoppable! It is simply a matter of time!”

West End Hotel. Durban 1970.
 E
ven Billy Nair, a veteran anti-apartheid activist, 
looked speechless. The younger men were stunned into 
silence.
 “
This was going on… ” Abass muttered, “and, until 
now, we knew blow all about it! Its like…you know…it happened in another country, on another planet, and we had nothing to do with it… ”
 
 “
Well… ”Sam Naidoo mused, “It was a long time 
ago, before we were born. But I’ll be lying if I said the story of Valliamma’s life doesn’t excite me. But it depress-es me too, makes me feel sort of guilty, like I’ve failed in some way, neglected my responsibilities and ignored the a b u s e …”     
 “
Seems to me, ” Sonny Murugen snorted angrily, 
“that we have allowed the witous to neuk us and we did nothing about retaliating, taking them on and putting them in their place. ”
 “
We may not have done anything, ” Thumba pro-
tested, “but a lot of our okes, like Billy here, Fatima Meer, Ismail Meer, Goonum…heck man, that list is as long as the street outside. Look at what they did to Phyllis Nai-doo?  And they’re still active, not shy to take our rulers on and paying the price. How about you, Billy, how many times have you been in the tronk?”
 “
I don’t keep count. And it was Amina Pahad who 
once said, when asked a similar question, ‘I don’t see the point of such a response, to reply to such inane queries. In a fight for basic rights, imprisonment is not a deterrent. It is a badge of honour. ’ That was a brilliant statement. If we now have to consider the horrors of jail, of places like Robben Island, our determination will be diluted.
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   98 2011/11/01   1:59 PM99
The Agony of Valliamma “ And you lighties need to get a bit of perspective 
here. Y ou can believe what you like, but you had better understand something: This is not an Indian thing! Every man and woman who loves freedom is fighting for liberty. That includes every White, Coloured, Indian and African in this country. Those racial tags, they insult every think-ing person. We see ourselves as South African – period!
 “
Right at this minute, even as we talk, there is a 
man - a patriot who loves all of humanity – sitting in a prison on Robben Island. At his trial, in 1964, he made a statement that almost every man who loves justice has memorized. I have by-hearted every word of his speech and you boys will benefit from it if you do the same. What he said was: ‘This is what I believe in, this is what I live for, and if needs be this is what I’ll die for. ’
 “
That man’s name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela 
and he was talking about his battle against racial injustice. He went on to say: ‘I detest racism, because I regard it as a barbaric thing, whether it comes from a black man or a white man. ’ 
 “
And then he added: ‘I have fought against white 
domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free soci-ety in which all persons live in perfect harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. ’
 “
Every one of us who is involved in the struggle 
have made those words our mantra! I suggest you guys write it down, paste it on your bathroom mirror, and read it at the beginning of each day. It will change your lives for the better. 
 “
And, if I may add, what do you think the judge 
did after hearing those wise words? Do you think he gave Mandela a medal? He threw Mandela in jail, for life! He

The Agony of Valliammais still there, ten years later, and he is not talking about 
vengeance…he is just sad that a man who claimed to rep-resent a civilized race could descend to such despicable levels. ”
 W
hen Billy stopped speaking, the silence was over -
whelming. For almost a full minute nobody said a word, each digesting Billy’s speech and his comments. At last, Sonny broke the silence, his voice suddenly loud in the hush that had settled over them.  “Okay, my bra! Point made and point taken, ” Sonny con-ceded. “But we’re talking like its now too late, that the bat-tle is over and we lost it. Life is lekker, sweet and easy. All of us here know that is nowhere near true, more now than ever before… ”
 “
Y ou know, boet, ” Mohan interjected, “listening to 
uncle Soobry and Billy, all I hear is about strikes, protest rallies, taking the witou on, that not all vitous are bad…there’s nothing about love here. I mean, didn’t people fall in love? How about Valliamma? Didn’t she have a boy-friend, feelings for some guy… ”
 “
Y ou’re mistaking the main issue here, ” Billy Nair 
chuckled. “It is all about love! Love for liberty, freedom, justice, love for human rights…Valliamma was the epito-me of everything those concepts represent. She didn’t live long enough to experience that other emotion…she was still a kid… ”
 “
Okay, maat, okay!” Mohan said placatingly. “I take 
that back and I stand corrected. There’s a lot more to love than a man and woman thing. ”
 “
Oh, there is that too. Do you think the wives of 
guys like Cachalia, Thambi Naidoo, H.O.Ally, P .K Naidoo and a hell of a lot of others didn’t love their men?” Billy demanded, somewhat angrily.“No!” Mohan agreed, “I don’t think that. And I wasn’t be-ing facetious or flippant. It was just a thought, stupid per -

 “
Now that is what I like about you lighties, ” Soobry 
said, entering the debate for the first time. And it was ob-
vious that he was very tired, he had been talking for hours and it was taking its toll. “ Anyway, there’s not much more to tell you, we are near the end…Valliamma’s end… ”

The Agony of ValliammaChapter Seventeen
Newcastle, Natal. 1913.
 V
alliamma and her group were stunned, they 
couldn’t believe what they were seeing. More than a thou-
sand workers, men and women, had turned out to hear the crusaders. And the anger was reflected in their faces as they stood stiffly in tight little knots and silently waited to be addressed.
 L
ooking at the sea of faces before her, Valliamma, 
for the first time, felt intimidated. They are here to listen to what we have to say, she told herself. All we have is a message. We can’t free them. Are they aware of that? They are the only ones who can fight to escape from their bondage. Do they appreciate that they have the power to break the bonds and free themselves.
 W
e must not, cannot, fail them, she repeated to 
herself. This is the greatest mission I have ever undertak-en. Up to now, the rallies, the marches, the lives lost on our journey, were no more than sending a message to our rulers, telling them that they have to stop the brutality. But now, today, I will ask these poor slaves to stand up to their masters and demand what is rightfully due to them, by stopping work, going on a strike!
 D
o they not suffer enough? Will we deprive them 
of what little they have? Take away the meager food from their children’s mouths and throw it back at those that deny them a living wage? Do I have the right to do that? Am I now playing God and encouraging these simple souls to stand up and shout out aloud for a fair share of their labour?
 W
hy am I now doubting my determination to in-
culcate the need to ensure  that justice is apportioned fairly and administered  to all, regardless of race or skin

 A
nd then she mentally shrugged. I’m doing what I 
was born to do. All I am suggesting is that, through gen-
erations of suppression, they have lost sight of their basic rights. I am asking them to demand those God-given and legitimate entitlements and restore their dignity. They have been downtrodden for long enough, it is time they defied their taskmasters who for far too long have tyran-nised them.
 V
alliamma straightened up, raised her right hand 
as if taking an oath, and shouted, her voice reverberating off the mine dumps and the sound waves echoing over the valley:  “Shatham Prati Satyam – truth against a rogue!”
 A t
housand voices echoed her cry, fists pointed at 
the sky, their faces reflecting their anger.
 Th
ambi Naidoo jumped onto the makeshift stage, 
hastily erected by the local Indian carpenters, and began a speech that would be remembered by all present that day for the rest of their lives.
 “
Y our fathers were slaves, they were brought here 
as slaves, deluded into thinking they were coming to a new world where they could live happily and in comfort. That was enough to persuade them to leave their ances-tral villages.
 “
When they experienced their pain, their subju-
gation, do you think they didn’t dream about freedom? For themselves? For you? In their impotence they strived on, believing that you will escape the drudgery that had become a way of life for them. That became their new dream, their hope for change.
  “
And you let them down, you shattered their 
dreams for you, you betrayed them!
 “
But now you will say that you have to put food 
on the table, that you cannot stand to see your children

The Agony of Valliammastarve. Am I to believe that they are not already starving? 
That you don’t have the means to educate them, to incul-cate the ambition to better themselves, to succeed where you failed?
 “
Y ou can continue dreaming until you die, but 
while you do that think about your children. Will you leave them with a legacy of slavery, to perpetuate the sys-tem of exploitation? Is that how you will show your love for them?
 “’
But what can we do?’ you ask, like helpless fish 
thrashing on a line. Y ou don’t stop to think, you forget that you possess an enormous power, the power to with-draw your labour and bring the mines to a standstill!  
 “
Without your labour these mines will shut down! 
Those that abuse you will be hurt financially and it will be a huge setback to their profiteering schemes. 
 “
Withdraw your labour! Send a message that you 
have been strangled for too long and you will now refuse to participate in your exploitation. Stop work! And then watch the agony of the mine bosses.
 “
I’m not asking you to stop working for ever, just 
long enough to shake those complacent profiteers out of their smug stance. I’m asking you to go on a STRIKE! For a week! A decent wage is not something that will be handed to you on a golden plate. Y ou have to demand it! And you must also ask for better working conditions and better living quarters.
 “
Do not think, for a minute, that your employ-
ers, sitting comfortably in their palatial homes situated on the top of the hills, are unaware of your plight. They need to be shaken up, to finally acknowledge that you are not slaves, not tools good only to operate the spades and shovels that are thrown at you. 
 “
Go back to work after a week, but leave the threat 
hanging in the air that you will strike again if they don’t 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   104 2011/11/01   1:59 PM105
The Agony of Valliammarespond positively to your fair demands.
 “
And make sure you are fair, that you don’t make 
the mistake of asking for more than what is due to you 
- the true worth of your labour – ask for more than you are worth and you will be no better than the mine owners and become exploiters yourselves.
 “
Of course they will threaten to fire you. Y ou can 
be sure that it will be no more than that – just a threat. When their profits are hurt they don’t like it. But if you are reasonable about your demands the good people from amongst them will behave equally responsibly.
 “
Y ou can go on and do nothing, you can continue 
to strut about in your fowl-runs pretending that you are some great heroes, you can keep on dreaming. Nobody will force you to act. And you will still be dreaming when you die. But if you want your children to progress, to edu-cate themselves and escape this drudgery, now is the time to strike. 
 “
But I must warn you - do not, whatever the provo-
cation, resort to violence whilst you are on strike. Behave in the true teachings of satyagraha, go about your mission peacefully.
 “
Last night I spoke to the local Indian merchants. 
All of them promised, without hesitation, to provide you with food when you are not working. Y our families will not starve.
 “
Go with God, secure in the knowledge that he is at 
your side at all times. ”
 W
hen Thambi stepped off the makeshift stage and 
walked towards Valliamma and her team of reformers who had followed them from Volksrust, he was mobbed by a throng of workers, all demanding that he lead them on their campaign and set a date on which they should revolt against their masters. Thambi advised them to se-

The Agony of Valliammalect their own leaders, from amongst themselves. “ P .K. 
Naidoo will guide you. I must move on. I still have many towns to call on, people to address. ”
 Th
ambi Naidoo, together with P .K., took Val-
liamma aside, away from the hordes and towards a quiet spot. “We have just been informed that Gandhiji is be-ing harassed and continuously arrested. He isn’t bothered about himself. He has contacted the Minister of Interior, warning him that the satyagrahis are being molested and are thrown in jail. He has given a clear warning that the deaths of our people are going to be laid at the govern-ment’s door and will be their responsibility. ”
 “
I will not allow myself to be deterred from my 
work. They can do what they like. The next towns I will be going to are Dundee, Dannhauser, and Ladysmith. Then to Pietermaritzburg and Tongaat. I will bring this govern-ment to its knees!”
 “
Y ou are tired, my dear. I can see the exhaustion in 
your face. Y ou have to conserve your energy. ”
 “
To do what? What is more important? Freedom 
and liberty or my bed?”
 “
How old are you, my girl? Fifteen? Y ou may look 
and have the brain of someone twice your age, that you are a genius is not in doubt. But you are also human and vulnerable to stress. If you collapse from fatigue now, the movement will be greatly weakened. ”
 “
Others will take over! The people are incensed. 
They want action. We can’t afford to lose the momentum. ”
 “
Gandhiji is convinced that the authorities have 
you in their sights. If they lock you up now our cause will be severely hampered. Please think about it. ” 
 “
If I stop to do that, uncle Thambi, I’ll lose my drive 
and perhaps never recover. For me that would be a calam-i t y.”
 “
I’m not asking you to stop your quest. All I’m say-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   106 2011/11/01   1:59 PM107
The Agony of Valliammaing is that you slow down, conserve your strength and 
give your body a chance to recover. Is that too much to ask?” 
 “
No, it isn’t. I know you are concerned about me 
and I am not unappreciative. I assure you…a few more weeks and then I’ll go home. I’m missing my family. There are nights when I cry for them, just to feel their touch. I am not like some of our leaders, who make long speeches and then go home to sleep. The day I get every Indian, every person of colour, to strike, my work will be done. Is that too much to ask?”
 “
No…no…it isn’t. I have no arguments to refute 
your logic. All I can now say is that we will be at your side, always. From there, it is over to God. ”
 “
And with him at our side, how can we lose!”
 “
I’m not sure what it is, P .K. That talk of hers, to the 
mineworkers in Newcastle, was brilliant. Looking at her no one will believe that she is not yet sixteen. Gandhiji is right when he says that she is gifted! What else can ex-plain her choice of words, the depth of her understanding and concern for the workers. Even her formal education, such as it was worth, could not have prepared her for this t a s k .”
 “
Thambi, you are judging her…no, that’s not true…
you are assessing her by normal standards. This girl is way ahead of her years, when Gandhiji says that she is gifted I can’t help feeling as if it is an understatement. Dare I say it? I’m convinced that she is from the ranks of our greatest saints, a reincarnation of  those that were created from Buddha’s ribs. It may sound fanciful, but it is what I believe and I have known her from the day she was born. She has never, not even under the greatest stress, slan-dered or humiliated anyone, not even those who violated her rights. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   107 2011/11/01   1:59 PM108
The Agony of Valliamma “ I’m not sure I will go so far. I have seen her, watched 
her develop over the years…I’ll readily concede that she is unique - a prodigy, a paragon of absolute moral princi-ples – as for being a saint…I’m no expert, my brother… ”
 “
Well…I guess we’re only speculating now. But the 
government’s dogs are on her tail, she has become too powerful, the people adore her and will follow her into the furnaces of hell. Our rulers know this, and you can be sure that they will stop her, whatever the cost. The word is already out. Its now only a matter of days before they come for her. ”
 “
And that becomes our responsibility. We must 
find a way to keep her in some form of seclusion… ”
 “
Y ou know that she will never agree to that. All we 
can do is let it play itself out, let events take their course, and pray that Valliamma evades their clutches. ”
 “
Talk about saints! Here she comes, full of bounce 
and skipping across the dusty road. ”
 “
Y ou can’t take the girl out of her! She is a contra-
diction within herself – alternating between an adult and a young maiden. I’ d love to enter her mind, just for a min-ute… ”
 “
Vannakum, Valliamma, ” Thambi smiled welcom-
ingly. “Y ou look happy!”
 “
Vannakum, uncle Thambi, uncle P .K. Y es, I am 
happy. Tomorrow we march to Dannhauser and we are all excited. If we get a turnout like the one we had here it will be a cause for celebration. ”
 “
And you are not worried about the government’s 
dogs who are on their way?” Thambi asked.

Oh, I wouldn’t call them all dogs. Some are work-

 “
Even if you have to spend the rest of your life in 
jail?” P .K. asked, sounding concerned.
 “
How long is the rest of my life? If I can just spend 
a day with my family I can face up to anything after that. ”
 “
Then go home, today, ” Thambi said persuasively, 
“Leave now. Y ou can continue this mission after that. ”
 “
I don’t have the time, uncle. I have to see this 
through! While I still can. ”

 “
Okay, enough!” Soobry Pillay said decisively, ris-
ing from his chair and heading for the door. “I’m tired. 
And I have to see what’s going on out in the front. Y ou boys have worn me out. Leave it for now. ”
 B
illy Nair held up a hand, staying any objections. 
“Let’s join Soobry. I’m dry and hungry. We can persuade our raconteur to pick it up from where he just stopped, tomorrow. ”
 Th
ey silently trooped out of the room, heads bowed, 
each absorbed within himself, believing every word they had heard and yet unable to come to terms with it. 
 A
s they lined up across the bar counter, waiting to 
be served, Sonny Murugen fumed, “I hear all this, and sure, my heart goes out to that kid. But then I ask my-self, what has changed? She put her ezie on the line, took those okes on, and what happened? The vitous still call the shots! Y ou guys, Billy, you follow the same route that she and her connections did and we’re no better off. But out there, on the street, we don’t take their kuk, we neuk them!”
 “
Sonny has a point, ” Abbas asserted. “From way 
back then you chaps have been singing the non-violent song, following the peaceful route. Comes a time when you have to say ‘no way, man! I’m gonna push back, som-mer take you on. ’”
 “
It’s a funny thing, ” Mohan said ironically, “When 
we bucklay with them, they back off pretty quickly. Y ou want to tell me what your style has achieved?”
 B
illy Nair was about to reply when a harmless look-
ing youngster, a White boy, strolled in and stepped up to the counter.
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   110 2011/11/01   1:59 PM111
The Agony of Valliamma “ This is an Indian bar, buddy, ” Sonny snarled. 
“Y ou’re in the wrong place. ”
 “
Y a? Hey, I’m new here. I only want a drink, man. ”
 “
Y ou telling me you don’t know the law?” Sonny 
demanded. “We look like a bunch of punks to you?”
 “
Y ou said that, man, ” the newcomer protested. “I’m 
not looking for shit. ”
 “
Y ou know something, mister, ” Sonny responded 
menacingly. “Y our people make the laws. Now me, I don’t know much about politics and I know even less about you witous. I’ve never seen you before, but I know your kind. Y ou’re nothing but full of crap, thinking you can walk in here and we will all say ‘kom, baas, let me buy you a drink. ’ Well, I have news for you, pal, get the hell out of here while you can still walk!”
 “
And consider yourself lucky, ” Mohan added.
 Th
e youngster, looking flustered, turned to go 
when Soobry called out, “Wait, son. Y ou come right in. Everybody is welcome here. This is my place. Sonny, we don’t do the Security Branch’s dirty work. ”
 “
Hey, ou maat, ” the newcomer said defensively, 
“I’m a bruinou, man. How come you okes tune false with me? Y ou treat me like I’m a Naainigile Joe!”
 S
onny looked crestfallen. Mohan held out his right 
hand, by way of apology. The others moved aside to create a space for the visitor. 
 “
No offence, maatie” , Mohan gave a friendly smile. 
Now I’ll buy you a drink, boet. ”
 “
It happens quite often, manne, ” the new boy re-
plied. “In some places it is an advantage, you get treated special. By the way, my name is Trevor Fassom. ” 
 “
And I’m Mohan Govender. My friends call me 
Mo.”
 “
Just bad timing, son, ” Billy said genially. “We hap-
pened to be talking about some unsavoury matters, about 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   111 2011/11/01   1:59 PM112
The Agony of Valliammathe way us darkies are treated in this country. I guess the 
boys were all hyped up and when you walked in they just sort of…you know, lost it. It was the wrong reaction, even if you were White. ”
 “
Its okay, mister. I’m used to it. Even my own mense, 
the okes who don’t know me, take off with me sometimes. And you know, those same chaps they don’t see me as a bruinou. They refer to me as a colourpean – a playwhite - like I’m a piece of shit, you know what I mean?”
 “
I do, indeed. We are our own worst enemies. We 
practise the most obscene form of racism, worse than an-ything the Whites throw at us… ”
 “
Not where I come from, buta. I live in a block of 
flats in Bond Street. And we’re all one big family there – charous, bruinous and even a few peckyous. We julate in and out of each other’s posies and don’t knock on the door. And the aunties out there, they sommer khup you if you tune false. ”
 “
Okay, great, ” Sam Naidoo said in his usual easy-
going manner. “Now that we have identified each other can we talk about Valliamma? Seems to me that kid is about to declare war. Uncle Soobry… ”
 “
Not today son, ” Soobry said, closing the subject. 
“I have a business to run. But you can come back tomor -
row and you can bring this new recruit with you. He may learn something. ”
 “
We have all the time in the world, ” Thumba Pillay 
chuckled. “Varsity is closed for the holidays and some of you hustlers can take a break from your rackets. ”
 “
Y a, ” Sam Naidoo ironically added, “The Bush Col-
lege, especially reserved for us darkies… ”
 “
Hey, Sammy, ” Thumba protested, “what can we 
do? Surely you know we’re barred from the other univer -
sities!”
 “
But when you go there, ” Sam said derisively, “its 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   112 2011/11/01   1:59 PM113
The Agony of Valliammalike you’re participating in the system. Playing ball with… ”
 “
Sam, my bra, you’re missing the whole point here. 
Our education is our priority. Where we get it from, un-
palatable as it may be, is a side issue. Once I get my law degree I’ll take the government on, with confidence and authority on the Westminster System.  That’s when people pay attention to your arguments. ”
 “
We should just blow the place up!” Mohan added 
explosively. “That will get their attention. ”
 “
And their wrath, ” Thumba asserted. “Nothing of 
value will be achieved. ”
 “
Y ou know what you lighties are advocating, ” Billy 
said impassionately, “you want to terminate a center of learning, kill the one place that still nurtures us. Guys like Thumba here, they go to the lectures, but under protest. To stay away altogether will kill our future, we’ll end up as an illiterate community. What you are suggesting, Mo-han, is like saying there’s a sure-fire cure for cancer – just shoot the patient! Y ou can’t kill me to save me!”
 “
What’re you complaining about, Billy?” Sam 
joked, “we will be elevating you to the status of a martyr. ”
 “
Martyrs are only celebrated when they’re dead. 
I’m not ready for that yet, ” Billy laughed.   
 “
This place, Tata, ” Abbas chuckled, “is breeding 
revolutionaries. And that back room of yours is turning into a college, with history lessons the only subject. ”
 “
Billy, ” Soobry said, “I have to see to my customers. 
Why don’t you update this lighty, Trevor, on Valliamma. That way he won’t keep interrupting me with a dozen questions. That’s if he plans to be there. ”
 “
I donno what you okes been tuning about, ” Trevor 
said, “but maybe I will come, after I hear your story, Billy. ”
 “
I’m not as good as Soobry when it comes to story-
telling. But I’ll tell you what I’ve heard so far and you boys here can interrupt as often as you like… ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   113 2011/11/01   1:59 PM114
The Agony of Valliamma Th ey strolled in, in ones and twos, heading directly 
for Soobry’s private room. A minute later Trevor Fassom walked in. “Soobry pointed me in this direction, I was heading the wrong way… ”
 “
Story of your life, ” Sonny chuckled. “ Anyway, I get 
the feeling that today will be our last meeting, on this top-ic. Uncle Soobry sounded like he was reaching the end of his tale. ” 
 “
And what will we do with it, ” Abbas asked accus-
ingly. “Won’t do much good if we go around bucklaying with every witou, or innocent guys like Trevor here. And he isn’t even one of them. ”
 “
What you do, my friend, ” Billy suggested, “is you 
learn from it. And you repeat it. As often as you can! And when the time comes, tell your children so that they’ll al-ways know where they are coming from. And a word of advice, from a veteran freedom activist: don’t make the mistake of knocking every White man you see. Don’t confuse them with their government. A large number of them don’t subscribe to this apartheid crap… ”
 “
I don’t dance to that jive, Billy!” Mohan objected. 
“Who voted this bunch into power? They did! We don’t have the damned vote, my bra!”
 “
I’m not sure of the legitimacy of the system. I 
won’t be surprised if it is rigged. But you must never re-spond with anger. It messes up your mind. It will over -
power your logic and destroy your reason. Anger is for fools, for idiots who can’t respond rationally. Y ou make that mistake and you lose the argument. ”
 “
And then nobody listens to you, ” Soobry added as 
he walked in, heading for the kettle. 
 “
Well…uncle Soobs, ” Abbas complained accusing-
ly. “I’ve seen you lose your cool and it wasn’t very funny. We jidigad sort of special outta here… ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   114 2011/11/01   1:59 PM115
The Agony of Valliamma “ We’re talking politics, my boy, not thuggery. ”
 “
And even in other situations, the advice holds 
true, ” Billy shrugged, his face expressionless. “ Anger re-
sults in anger, not a solution. ”
 “
Okay, fine, ” Sam said jokingly. “The next time I 
want lessons in life I won’t go to the mosque, I’ll come h e r e .”
 “
Y ou aint no slumou. ” Abbas laughed, “Y ou don’t 
go to the mosque. ”
 “
And neither do you, ” Sam responded, with good 
humour.
 “
Hey, my bro, a mosque is for sinners, ” Abbas 
grinned. “Now me, I’m pure as undiluted milk, I have no need – “
 “
Cut it out, you two, ” Mohan said, smiling widely.  
“I didn’t come here to listen to your thee and thy. ” Then he turned towards Soobry Pillay and asked, eagerly, “Tata, tell us more about Valliamma. I like that vilt babe. ”
 “
Vilt babe? Do you boys ever speak Engish? No, 
don’t answer that. Y ou’ve already…how do you say it…neuked my mind!”
 Th
ey burst into laughter and Billy Nair chuckled, 
“Well, Soobry, you seem to have acquired a sense of hu-mour, not a bad start for a ballie… ”
 “
Ballie my ezie!” Soobry snorted. “Listen to me 
now! I’m talking like these tunsels! I haven’t acquired a sense of humour, I’ve been corrupted. But okay, you want to hear about Valliamma? Not much left to tell you… ”

The Agony of ValliammaChapter Nineteen
Dundee. Natal. 1913.
 V
alliamma had been on the road for close two 
months. And it was beginning to take a toll on her health. 
After addressing the workers in Charlestown, Dundee, Ladysmith, Dannhauser, Pietermaritzburg and several other major towns, she took a break for a few days in ru-ral Tongaat, a place that she had often thought about and which occupied a special spot in her heart. From stories her father had told her, she knew that Tongaat was where her own grandparents, from both her father’s and her mother’s side, had settled. She wasn’t aware of any mem-bers of her ancestral families that still resided there, but couldn’t help speculating that someone, not necessarily a relative, would know something of her origins and add to her knowledge.
 S
he also had several speeches lined up for the resi-
dents of the town and the farms nearby. It was, after all, the heart of the sugarcane fields and the fountainhead of the exploitation of Indian workers, a derivation of slavery referred to by the subtle term: Indenture.
 A
s soon as she had settled the satyagrahis who had 
accompanied her from Johannesburg, at the homes of lo-cal Indian merchants, she quietly and secretively contact-ed the employees at several of the farms and encouraged them to tell her their stories.  For the first few days she slipped in and out of the farms and clandestinely spoke to many of the Indian workers. What she saw and heard shook her to the core of her being - their lives were far worse than anything she had experienced before. And their wretched living conditions were horrendous in the extreme.
 On a s
unny morning in early December she sent a 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   116 2011/11/01   1:59 PM117
The Agony of Valliammamessage to all the farmworkers – prepare for a rally, she 
would address them later that day.
 I
t was a mistake, the biggest she had made in her 
career – she hadn’t allowed for the power that the farmers wielded in the town. Within an hour, she had been ar -
rested and hauled off to a prison cell. Before the day was over, her team of passive resisters had been picked up and thrown into prison. 
 Th
e next morning they were herded to the railway 
station and sent to the jail in Pietermatizburg, without a formal hearing or a trial. As soon as they had disem-barked, a team of police officers, who had been awaiting their arrival, threw Valliamma, together with her co-re-sisters, into a filthy cell that barely allowed them space to breathe.
 Th
e magistrate ordered that they be incarcerated 
pending his pleasure. And then, several days later, they were inexplicably allowed to go – on the express condi-tion that they would be out of the town before the day was over. 
 E
ventually, some two months after they had set off  
from Tolstoy Farm, they reached Volksrust, the border town dividing Natal and Transvaal. The eleven women that had accompanied Valliamma throughout the jour -
ney were worn out, fatigued and famished. And Valliam-ma sensed that they were beginning to sound somewhat disoriented and mentally exhausted. Only the thought of returning to their homes kept them going.
 “
Don’t become dispirited, ” she urged them. “Our 
rulers are shaken, they’re getting worried. The number of times they arrested us, that alone proves that they are no longer as confident and as complacent as they used to be. Be brave and don’t waver. ” 
 “
Y es, that’s true, ” Meenachee confirmed. “We have 
also stirred the workers and they are demanding their 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   117 2011/11/01   1:59 PM118
The Agony of Valliammarights. That alone warms my heart. ”
 “
It will be nice to be reunited with our families, ” 
Veeramal Naidoo said yearningly. “Thambi is pining for 
home too!”
 Th
ey had hunkered down on an open veld and, af-
ter some of the women had gathered twigs and several dry pieces of wood, settled down to light a fire. Even in mid-December, normally the hottest days of summer, the evenings were distinctly chilly. And, in the absence of warm clothing, a fire was a lifesaver.
 “
Gandhiji, not long ago, led a group of satyagrahis 
to this very place. We are following in his footsteps, ” Mrs. P .K. Naidoo said, to no one in particular. “They locked him up. But, just a few days ago, he organized the strikers in Pietermaritzburg. When we were there the other day I was told that the police  had intervened brutally and thrown Gandhiji in jail. That was when the strikers ri-oted… ”
 “
I think that man walking towards us is Mr. Badat, ” 
Valliamma said, standing up and walking towards the vis-itor. 
 “
Salaam, Valliamma. I hope you remember me. ”
 “
Salaam, my brother. How can I forget! Y our friends 
and family took care of us when we passed through here on our way to Newcastle. ”
 “
We saw your fire and I decided to investigate. I 
didn’t know you had come back. But you can’t stay here, in the cold. Please come with me, all of you. Y ou can stay with us and I’ll make sure you have a warm meal and some hot tea. ”
 “
Y ou are very kind. We are tired and need sanitary 
facilities and a bath. ”
 “
Y ou’ll have that, and more. Our people will pro-
vide you with a change of clothing too. ” Then Badat smiled, charmingly, “I can see you are in need of that. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   118 2011/11/01   1:59 PM119
The Agony of Valliamma Th ey had barely reached the entrance to the fron-
tier town when a little boy saw them and ran indoors. Within minutes a group of women, Ayesha Badat leading them, came up to the travellers, their lanterns casting a dull glow in the darkness. 
 “
Come, my sisters, ” Ayesha said welcomingly, then 
hugged Valliamma warmly. “News travels very slowly to this place, but we have heard of what you have been do-ing. Our people here view you as heroes. Our homes are now your homes. We will see to you. 
 “
Y our kindness, ” Valiamma started to say, when 
Ayesha waved her fingers and then turned towards her husband, “what are you waiting for? Go! Get the men to-gether and light some fires, heat a lot of water. Do it now!”
 A
yesha kept to her word, within a few hours all the 
marchers had been provided with bathing facilities, fed well, and located in the homes of the small Indian com-munity. Valliamma, on the verge of exhaustion, had col-lapsed on an improvised bed in a corner of Badat’s little son’s room, together with Meenachee.As she drifted off, her mind, normally a hive of activity and constantly planning their next move, was beginning to slow down and the only thought lingering within her was that they would soon be home and re-united with their loved ones.
    S
he sensed Meenachee, close to her and in deep 
slumber, moving restlessly and muttering under her breath. Automatically, her hand reached out and patted her friend’s shoulder, subduing and reassuring the tired woman. Meenachee turned on her side, sighed uncon-sciously, and curled into a ball.
 Th
e interruption, however, had disturbed her 
peaceful mood and feelings of tranquility. The brief in-terlude, when her buzzing brain had been on the verge of a much-needed rest, was lost. She was, once again, plan-

The Agony of Valliammaning the next days journey and making a mental note to 
ensure all eleven of her companions carried some food to replenish their energy and keep them going. 
 S
he was listening to the creaking sounds as the 
old house settled, as if it too was preparing to sleep for the night. She heard Rashid, the Badat’s little boy, cry out in his sleep, whimper for a second, and then he seemed to drift off into dreamland. Silence enveloped her once again.
 V
alliamma sighed, hugged her shoulders, and 
willed herself to get a much- needed sleep. Within min-utes, she was in dreamland.
They came early in the morning, just as the sun was rising 
over the horizon and casting a dull shadow over the land. There were five of them, huge men with wide shoulders and barrel-chests. They moved in absolute silence, blend-ing into the shadow around them. The leader, an impos-ing figure that loomed over his troop, glanced at one of his men, who was carrying a large axe, the type normally used for tree felling, and nodded commandingly. His sub-ordinate, looking menacing and ready for action, smirked as he stepped forward.
 W
hen the axe connected with the wooden door, it 
was like the sound of thunder and the whole house shook. The next blow shattered the door and loosened the hing-es. A mighty shove sent it flying to the ground.
 V
alliamma jerked upright, her mind completely 
disorientated, and jumped to her feet, heading for the ante-room. When she emerged from her room she saw Badat rush out, his sleeping clothes in disarray.
 “
What! What!” the old man cried, panting heavily, 
“How can you do this – “
 Th
e blow, on the side of her shocked host’s face, 
sent him reeling and he almost fell to the floor.
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   120 2011/11/01   1:59 PM121
The Agony of Valliamma  “ Shut your bloody mouth, coolie! Where are those 
bitches? Get them here, fast. Move your arse!”
 V
alliamma quickly stepped in front of her quiver -
ing guardian in an attempt to protect him from the hulk-ing brute and looked the man squarely in the eye “Who do you think you are, ” she demanded, “breaking into this house like a wild animal!”
 “
So…you are the famous bitch, the rabble rouser, 
the people’s savior. Time to break your skinny little back, you piece of shit! Where are the rest of your crew – “
 V
alliamma went into a crouch, raised her hands 
and, as she moved to adopt her intimidating pose, the ogre slapped her on her head and dropped her to the ground. Before she could recover, his minions had roughly lifted her off the floor and cuffed her hands behind her back.
 “
Throw her in the back of the truck! And you, you 
old bastard, start talking! Where are the other women? We know there were eleven of them, all troublemakers”
 A
t that moment, Meenachee emerged from her 
room and softly said, ‘I’m here. ”
 “
Take her with you!” the demented bully screamed 
to his men. “Now, Badat, where are the rest of them?”
 “
I’ve seen you before, ” Badat replied defiantly. “Y our 
name is Van Zyl. I deal with your people daily, when they come to my shop. The Afrikaner, they are not like you, they treat us with respect. Y ou are a savage – “
 “
Take this bastard with you, ” Van Zyl shouted at his 
headman. “Throw him in the same cell with these wom-en, together with the common criminals. The rest of you, raid every Indian house in this area, round up the rest of the cows and bring them to the jail. I’ll soon show them who is the boss here!” 
 “
Say nothing, ” Valliamma told the sisters. “Main-
tain total silence. Mister Badat has some influential White 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   121 2011/11/01   1:59 PM122
The Agony of Valliammafriends and they have freed him. He won’t leave it at that. 
We wait and watch. And don’t touch the food, it doesn’t smell right and one of our African brothers signaled to me that there’s something in it. ”
 Th
e women were sprawled on the floor of the tiny 
cell and shoved into a corner – the men, all African and arrested for various offences, courteously created a space for them and asked, solicitously, what they had been guilty of. 
 “
We are guilty of nothing, ” Valliamma told them. 
“We have been talking to people all over, asking them to go on strike and stop work. We were on our way back home when they arrested us and threw all of us in here. ”
 “
Hau! My sister, I think I have heard of you. Y ou 
are the one they call Valleymama, yes? We men, we are here because we went on strike. My name is Sifiso – “
 “
Shut up, bliksem, ” a warder snarled. “Y ou want a 
taste of my sjambok on your black bum!”
 Th
e speaker lapsed into silence, his eyes smoulder -
ing, indicating by moving his hands in small up and down motions for his mates to remain quiet.
 C
overing his lips with his hands, Sifiso swore softly, 
“Some day…that dog…I’ll send him to hell!”
 “ T
o do that, mkai, you have to kill him first, ” the 
man closest to Sifiso whispered back.
 “
Its all I live for. My day will come!”
 “
No!” Valliamma whispered back, “that is not our 
way. Violence will only create worse violence. Satyagra – “
 “
Hey, mama, ” Sifiso’s companion murmured, “they 
started the violence, so we will hit back, with greater vio-lence! When a man don’t listen, you stop talking! An eye for an eye – “
 “
Have you heard of Gandhi?” Valliamma asked.
 “
Y ebo! Great man, that one – “
 “
And that same great man once said that an eye for 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   122 2011/11/01   1:59 PM123
The Agony of Valliammaan eye will make the whole world blind… ”
 A
lthough they had been whispering, the warder 
must have heard them because he roughly pushed back 
his chair and faced them threateningly. “Y ou don’t listen. I’m going to donner you!”
 “
Y ou’ll have to open the cell gate to do that, ” Sifiso 
challenged. “Y ou think you can take us all on?”
 “
Gott!” their custodian flushed angrily, “Now 
you’re going to taste my –“
 B
efore he could complete his threat, Badat walked 
in with an officious looking White man and stepped up to the bars.
 “
Okay, ” Badat said, looking at Valliamma and her 
friends, “this gentleman is the local magistrate… ”
 B
efore he could complete his sentence, the magis-
trate stepped around him and asked, “Why are you ladies in here? In the male section?”
 “
We are on our way home, back to Johannesburg, 
The police just picked us up and –“ Valliamma started to  reply when the magistrate cut in, “Y ou have your travel permits?”
 “
No, we are citizens of this country. We don’t need 
permits to travel. ”
 “
The law says otherwise, ” the magistrate said, not 
unkindly. “It is my job to uphold the law. Where were you before you came here?”
 
“Pietermaritzburg. ”
 “
Then you have to go back there and that court 
can decide your fate. But you can’t be allowed to travel on your own, crossing the border means you are crimi-nals. I’ll make the necessary arrangements. Y ou will have to stay in your cells for a few days, but I have agreed to allow Badat here to bring you your daily meals. I can do no more. ” 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   123 2011/11/01   1:59 PM124
The Agony of Valliamma “ That magistrate was very courteous, ” Mrs. P .K. 
Naidoo said somewhat derisively. “ And then he throws us into this cattle truck!”
 “
It may not be his fault, ” Valliamma added reason-
ably. “We’ve been through worse. And the trip won’t take more than a day.
 “
Its not the trip that bothers me, ” Meenachee com-
plained, “I’m more worried about what happens when we get to ‘Maritzburg. ”
 “
What can happen, ” Mrs. P .K. Naidoo said, look-
ing at no one in particular. “Do you recall what Hermann Kallenbach told us back in Tolstoy Farm? ‘They will do everything they can to break your spirit. Don’t respond to them and don’t demand justice, they have no concept of it. Go into yourself and be in a state of trance whenever they torture you. Then nothing can hurt you. ’ 
 “
It is time to fall back on that advice. We have all 
been in jail before, many times, and we survived. We will do it again. ”
 “
But this truck, ” one of the ladies complained, “Is 
hurting my back, in the place where that filthy policeman punched me. It bumps over every pothole and shakes me like a wild horse jumping in fear. ”
 “
Try to sleep, ” Mrs. P . K. Naidoo suggested, “Just 
ignore the pain and think of home, of all the people you love and for whose freedom you are now suffering. There is no pain that can break your spirit when you keep just that one thought in your mind. ”
 “
Life and pain are inseparable, ” Veeramal Naidoo 
advised. “Once, when I complained to Thambi about the way we were being treated in jail, he told me, very quietly, ‘We Tamils have always believed that pain is proof that you are alive. If you have no pain then you are dead!’”
 “
And the more pain you suffer, ” Valliamma added 
contemplatively, “the more alive you are. We should all be

 Th
e rest of the torturous journey passed in silence, 
the women withdrawing into themselves and gathering strength from Veeramal’s and Valliamma’s words.

 S
oobry stopped talking, rather abruptly, and took 
a deep breath before straightening up in his chair. He 
raised his arms above his head, stretched elaborately and then settled back and sipped on his tea, grimacing when he realized that it had gone cold.
 W
hen he remained silent, Abbas asked, his voice 
subdued but with a touch of anger in his tone, “Tata, what kind of man throws a child in jail? Valliamma was…what? How old? Fifteen? And she was hucked into a cell with hardened criminals, men who had likely been sentenced for some atrocious crimes… ”
 “
Abbas” Billy Nair replied, preventing Soobry Pil-
lay from responding, “I have been in jail…I forget the number of times…but I want you chaps to understand something…even the most hardened criminal, often de-spised by society, has some pretty high moral values. He hates rapists and he admires a political activist. 
 “
That may not be a universal trait, but it exists – a 
lot more often than one is inclined to believe. A rapist, es-pecially one who abuses a child, becomes a pariah and is subjected to a rather drastic type of punishment, imposed by his own cellmates. A person sentenced for his political stance is treated as a hero and is protected by those same cellmates. I wouldn’t be surprised if Valliamma was ac-corded that respect. ”
 “
But, Billy, ” Sam Naidoo protested, “I can’t accept 
that a girl of Valliamma’s age would escape the crude at-tentions of guys who, in all likelihood, were incarcerated for being rapists themselves. That kind of an animal lives by his own rules, contrary to civilized behaviour. To be-lieve that he would restrain himself simply because she

The Agony of Valliammawas fighting the government… ”
 “
I was generalizing, Sam. Of course it isn’t the 
norm. But it does exist. ”
 “
I’m interested in what happened next… ” Thum-
ba Pillay said haltingly, “They couldn’t have just left her 
there, for the rest of her life… ”
 “
For the rest of her life?” Soobry questioned ironi-
cally. “ Are you boys forgetting that she continuously maintained that she was not for this world for long… ”
 “
Y a, sure, ” Sonny Murugen conceded, “but this kid, 
they gooied her in the tronk and didn’t give a damned that she was only fifteen. I mean, that’s bloody young, even for someone who can predict her own death. ”
 “
What are we saying here, ” Mohan Govender de-
manded, “Was that it? They dumped her in jail and that is the end of her life?”
 “
I think you lighties should let Soobry finish the 
story. Y ou’re jumping to conclusions… ”
 “
Okay, lekker, ” Abbas cut in, “It’s just that we’re 
pretty mal about what was done to her. Tata, you’re going to tell us what happened next?” 
 “
I already told you boys, we’re coming towards 
the end of her life…not the end, but nearly there. When they threw those ladies in jail, they eventually transferred them to a kind of communal cell – the worse kind – noth-ing like you can even imagine… ”

Pietermaritzburg. December 1913.
 “
I want you to remember what we spoke about on 
our way here, ” Mrs. P . K. Naidoo said, stressing each word 
and drawing all of them in. “They are sure that they will break us! They stuffed us in this tiny cell, with no toilet facilities, a bucket of water – to wash with or to drink – as we see fit, and food full of weevils and roaches.
 “
They give some of us decent food, to tempt the rest 
of us to fight over it. And they know that, as the days pass we will begin to smell and try to create our own space – and that will lead to even more quarrels.
 “
We must prove them wrong! We have to show 
them that a Tamil woman is made of greater courage and comes from a civilized race. They can brutalise us at will, but our response to it is in our hands. They can’t control that!”
 “
They can’t keep us in here for long, ” Veeramal 
pointed out. “They have locked up several thousands of our women, and that’s not counting the men. Even the filth they feed us requires money and they don’t like that. Just the amount it takes to making sure we don’t walk out of here must be enormous. ”
 “
I don’t think that bothers them, ” Mrs. P . K. com-
mented, rather derisively, her lips curling in contempt. “It’s our own money that is paying for all this – money that rightfully belongs to the people. They take our hous-es, they confiscate our properties and impound our goods – all in the name of some sick laws that we have no say in – and then they claim that we are the exploiters. ”
 “
Y es, my sister. Two of our more wealthy men, my 
own husband, Thambi - and Ahmed Cachalia - have both been reduced to nothing. And so have hundreds of oth-
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   128 2011/11/01   1:59 PM129
The Agony of Valliammaers, people who broke their backs to save for their families 
and their future. What they are now doing to us is noth-ing!”
 “
My father and my mother, ” Valliamma added bit-
terly, “slaved from early in the morning till late at night, carrying their baskets on their backs. They took nothing that didn’t belong to them. My appa always told me, ‘take a penny that doesn’t belong to you and you are no more than a common thief!’ And my amma lived in the belief that money that is stolen, even just a tiny amount, taints all of it. Uncle Ally called it dirty money, like a drop of urine in clean water.
 “
But who is paying for that crime? While we, my 
appa and amma, and five thousand others are suffering in jail the real criminals are living in luxury.
 V
elliamma burst into a coughing fit, her hands 
pressed to her chest and her legs buckling under her. She quickly straightened up, then wheezed, “How God pun-ishes them is His business. I intend to break their power and see justice being done long before God decides to find the time to make them pay for their sins! And I’ll do it Gandhiji’s way – I will not spill a drop of blood, ours or the exploiters, as I achieve my aims. ”  
 “
It is very easy, my child, for your anger to run away 
with you. When you then resort to fury you lose your hu-manity. Guard against hatred for your enemy – Gandhiji tells us this all the time. We must never lose sight of it. ”
 “
I’m no longer angry, ma, ” Valliamma replied qui-
etly. “I’m just saddened by the way we are abused, by peo-ple we have never harmed. And why are we here, in this hell-hole? We refused to be treated like pariah dogs with no rights! It is not hatred but demanding our God-given rights that I fight for. ”
 “
Hush, here comes that warder with our mush!” 
Veeramal warned, her finger on her lips.

The Agony of Valliamma Th e warder pushed the food bowls through the 
bars, then said, not unkindly, “I don’t think this is food for humans. I wouldn’t give it to my dog!” 
 “
It’s not your fault, my brother, ” Mrs. P .K. said reas-
suringly. “We do not grudge you in any way. ”
 “
But that child, she needs medicine. I hear her 
cough, her chest heaving like a sick animal. I don’t think this is right!”
 “
She has to be seen by a doctor, urgently, ” Veeramal 
stressed. “Please tell your superiors to attend to her. ” 
 “
They don’t welcome my suggestions. I’ve com-
plained to them about this child often… ”
 “
She is fifteen years old! She could be your own 
granddaughter. What kind of people do you work for?”
 “
Gott, meisie! I am not in charge here… ”
 “
Please… just speak to someone. If she doesn’t re-
ceive attention soon she could be in danger… ”
 “
I will try, but nobody listens to me. ”
 “
I can go home? Why? They didn’t lock me up be-
cause I was sick! I am here as a political prisoner, for pro-testing against their laws. Will they now repeal those laws too?”
 “
Valliamma, ” Mrs. P .K. said persuasively, “Y ou need 
treatment. And the people need you. When you are better – “
 “
Then what? Must I come back here? For crimes 
that the rest of the world thinks I am innocent of? If they want to release me, they must admit I am guilty of noth-i n g .”
 “
They won’t do that, my child. They don’t apologise 
to anybody – “
 “
Then I will sit right here. I refuse to be released for 
medical reasons. If anybody is guilty, they are! For crimes against humanity – that is what uncle Ally always called

 “
But even he is now demanding that you be re-
leased, immediately. ”
 “
General, ” Gandhi asked, “ Am I to believe that the 
rule of law, as recognized internationally, no longer ap-
plies in South Africa?”
 “
That’s ludicrous! We have always maintained that 
we are a democracy, that we subscribe to the decision of the judges –“
 “
Look here, Smuts, this is an argument that you 
have already lost. But what am I asking for? This is not a discussion on a repeal of your illegitimate regulations, which in any case only apply to people of colour. I lost my respect and high regard – if I ever had any – for your gov-ernment a long time ago. All I am asking from you is that you release a fifteen year old child who is dying in jail. Why are we now talking about ‘democracy’ and ‘judges’ . That has no relevance to my appeal. ”
 “
Mr. Gandhi, we have differed, often, but never in 
anger. And I know that you despise it. Why do you now sound so very cross? Can we not… ”
 “
General, we can continue this debate at some later 
stage. That child, Valliamma, is in urgent need of medi-cal care, and your prison can’t provide it. The world will judge you by how you respond to my appeal. ”
 “
I am not insensitive to the matter. My secretary 
was instructed to attend to it. She has reported that your Valliamma refuses to accept pardon, on medical grounds. The matter is now out of my hands… ”
 “
No, my good friend, you can’t dismiss it so simply. 
She doesn’t want amnesty, because she doesn’t think she is guilty of any crime. Y ou know it. I know it. Why prolong her agony! It is within your power to release her uncon-ditionally. With the greatest of respect, I find it difficult to

The Agony of Valliammareconcile your words with your actions. ”
 “
I won’t take that as an insult, because I know it is 
not in your nature to be rude. Okay… I agree to however 
you wish to handle it, but you must personally convey that to her. I wash my hands off this matter, as of now!”
 Th
ey waited at the gates, an appreciably large crowd. 
Their eyes scanning each face as the women walked out of prison. A number of dignitaries, amongst them inter -
national luminaries such as Parsi Rustoomjee and Albert Christopher, stood silently and raised their fists in saluta-tion as the satyagrahis emerged, in various stages of disar -
ray.
 S
ome of the detainees were being assisted by their 
co-prisoners as they stumbled onto the street, barely able to walk. The sympathisers , eyes moist, rushed forward and embraced their frail sisters, then fell back when the police officers threatened to horsewhip them.
 A
nd then, when it appeared as if there were no 
more due to be released, a solitary figure, almost bent doubled and in obvious pain, helped by an elderly warder, stumbled through the gates and lifted her face, her eyes closed in agony.
 “
It’s Valliamma, ” someone shouted. “That’s Val-
liamma!”
 V
alliamma opened her eyes, grimaced in pain, 
and then, to every onlooker’s surprise, she called out, her voice strong, “Shatham Prati Satyam!” She repeated the mantra before her legs gave way.
 “
Shatham Prati Satyam, ” a hundred voices echoed 
the call before the police moved in.

Doornfontein. February 1914.
Nothing had changed. The shack was still as dismal as al-
ways, the winter chill froze the cement floor and the cold wind howled through the cracks.
 M
unuswami had either bought or borrowed a sin-
gle bed and Valliamma was tucked onto the lumpy mat-tress when Gandhi walked through the door, bowing re-spectfully towards Mangalam and her husband.
 “
Valliamma, ” Gandhi asked, looking at the emaci-
ated body, his voice concerned and soft, “Y ou have paid a bitter price for our freedom. Do you have any regrets about going to jail?”
 “
Regret? I am even now ready to go to jail. ”
 “
But what if it results in your death?”
 “
I don’t mind. Who would not die for one’s moth-
erland?”
 “
I am proud of you. All of our people are proud of 
you. Now rest, get your strength back. I will come to see you again, before I leave for India. May God watch over y o u .”
 “
Gandhiji, ” Mangalam whispered as soon as they 
stepped out of the house, “Valliamma is extremely sick. The doctor is worried. She is not responding to his treat-ment.. ”
 “
She has been through a trying time, a painful ex-
perience that even the strongest adult would have suc-cumbed to. She needs a few weeks, to recover and get back to her usual self. Have faith. ”
 “
Her dear friend, Meenachee, comes over daily and 
attends to her needs. She will be here soon. It gives me the chance to get on with my housework and prepare nour -
ishing meals for her. ”
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   133 2011/11/01   1:59 PM134
The Agony of Valliamma “ Valliamma is now an icon amongst the people. 
Her spirit is invaluable to the Resistance. Her friends from her earliest days, who were with her at every rally, young fighters like Nagappen, Ahmed Mohamed, and Narain-samy, are now dead, killed by the harsh regime. We must not let them take her too!”
 “
Thanks to God, her voice is still strong. Her appa 
and me, we can only pray for her to get better. ”
 “
Indeed she will! I return to India in a few days. 
I intend to let everyone there know about your brave daughter. Her reputation has already preceded my return – people there are talking about her valiant stand for our rights. ”
 “
Go then, and may Lord Vishnu be at your side, 
always. ”
 “
And yours. And Valliamma’s. ”
Meenachee came early the next morning and went direct-ly to Valliamma’s bed, checked that she was resting, pulled the bedsheet over her, and then turned toward Mangalam, who was washing clothes in a tub in her backyard. “She is breathing well. I think she has passed the worst stage and is sleeping comfortably. She’s on the mend. ”
 “
Y es, I think last night was her best night since she 
came back home. She wasn’t mumbling in her sleep and crying from the pain. In a few days she will be walking a r o u n d .”
 “
Let me do the washing, ma. Y ou need to rest too. ”
 “
Me? Rest? Tchah, child! I’ve done a lot more than 
this. In prison we were forced to wash the clothes that the prisoners had used. And also the clothes of all the white criminals. That was all day, every day. This is nothing. ”
 “
But you need to rest now, just for a while. I’ll make 
tea and I have brought a piece of cake that the shopkeeper gave me – it was his son’s birthday. Come, we may even 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   134 2011/11/01   1:59 PM135
The Agony of Valliammagive Valliamma a piece, if she is awake. ”
 M
angalam considered Meenachee’s request, 
shrugged then said, “Come, child. I’ll make the tea. In this 
house that’s my job. ”
 Th
e two women, one barely a teenager, walked to-
wards a corner of the room, which Mangalam used as a kitchen, and filled a pot with fresh water from a covered jug. Before she could light a fire, they heard Valliamma groan, then call out, “ Amma! Please come to me. ” 
 “
Valliamma, my child, are you hurting?”
 “
Amma, I can’t breathe! My chest hurts and my 
heart is heavy, like I’ve been running. ”
 M
eenachee was already through the door, scream-
ing for someone to call the doctor urgently. When she was back in the room, she said, “ Aunty Savthree is gone to fetch doctor Ebrahim. He always comes here very quick-l y.”
 “
Valliamma is breathing very hard. Get a wet cloth. 
She’s sweating a lot and is in pain. ”
 F
or the next ten minutes Meenachi wiped Valliam-
ma’s forehead and Mangalam gently massaged her child’s shoulders, praying softly and crying, the tears running down her cheeks.
 W
hen doctor Ebrahim walked, he threw a quick 
glance at Valliamma, took her wrist between her fingers, and checked her pulse. “This is not good, ” he said, very quietly. “This child needs to be in a hospital – “
 “
Amma!” Valliamma called out, sounding delirious. 
“I love you and appa. SHATHAM PRATI SANGAM!”
 Th
e doctor gently folded Valliamma’s hands over 
her chest, turned towards Mangalam, then said, “Ma, she is gone. We have lost her. ”
 M
angalam’s scream floated down the street and 
over the hills! And then she moaned! It was a sound like

The Agony of ValliammaChapter Twenty Three
West End Hotel. Durban, 1970.
 S
oobry’s pub was silent, like a place of worship 
before the priest delivered a eulogy. The regulars - who 
had lived in tandem with their heroine’s life - lined up against the bar counter and resembled a group of mourn-ers in various stages of grief, their faces a strange mixture of pain, loss, and anger. They had forgotten the drinks in front of them, lost their bearings and were not even cer -
tain of where they would go from there. 
 A
t last, when the hush became overpowering, Bil-
ly said, somewhat haltingly, “we are fond of saying ‘Rest in Peace’ . Does Valliamma rest in peace? I doubt it! She fought for a united South Africa, one nation and one peo-ple, and that has not happened, to this day. ”
 “
Shit!” Abbas cried, his upper lip stretched tightly 
over his teeth. “Tata…you could have warned us, pre-pared us – “
 “
For what, Abbas?” Soobry demanded. “Prepared 
you for death? Didn’t I warn, at the very beginning, that she was not of this world for long?”
 “
But, Tata, they murdered her, ” Abbas swore, “It 
was no different to stabbing her in the chest with a knife!”
 “
Y ou boys want to think about this, ” Billy said very 
quietly, “Valliamma’s death was not a death. Her sacrifice, for all of us, continues to this day. The big question here is what did you learn from it? Do you understand that ‘justice’ is more than a word, more than the noises that corrupt politicians make when they can no longer justify their behavior?”
 “
We hear you, Billy, ” Sam said slowly and clearly. 
“We knew nothing about that struggle – this struggle. To-day we are better for it. Freedom is never handed to you 
Agony of Valliamma Text.indd   137 2011/11/01   1:59 PM138
The Agony of Valliammaon a plate. Y ou have to fight for it!”
 “
Which is what we are doing. And will continue 
until we are all free, from bondage and prejudice. Our 
battle goes beyond just politics, there are moral issues that need to be fought for…Gandhi knew that, Valliamma emulated him. Until the very idea of colour is expunged from our minds we will never be a free nation. ”
 “
I agree with every word you said, ” Abbas con-
firmed, somewhat disappointedly. “But I have to ask: In all this time, for over a hundred years, there isn’t even a bust, never mind a statue, of that great girl. Those larnies, in Jozie, they couldn’t have honoured her, a legend who we now know all about? Perhaps her likeness on the very piece of land where her home stood?” 
 “
I could ask all of you the same question: what are 
you going to do about it! Y ou can no longer say ‘I didn’t know. ’ And I’m not talking about building statues, I’m simply asking about your political stance – from this day o n .”
 “
Billy, ” Soobry quietly added, “they are not answer -
able to us. That is a decision that only they can make. They can remain third class citizens, or they can demand justice. I am too old to care what these lighties will do!”    
 “
My point is that it’s not who the government is, 
but what it does for you or to you.  We pay their sala-ries – whether through PAYE or whatever.  They are our servants, answerable to us.  Their job is not to line their pockets or benefit only themselves.  We have the right to demand answers from them.  And if we don’t like what we hear, we kick their backsides.  We need to wake up!”
 “
What we need… ” Soobry muttered, with a tinge of 
sadness, “Is another Valliamma!”

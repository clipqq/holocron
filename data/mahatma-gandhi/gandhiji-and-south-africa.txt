1993FOREWORD
I feel greatly honoured to be asked to write a Foreword to this book. It ap pears at
precisely the right moment in the history of the struggle against the institutionalised
racism known as ‘apartheid.’ For only now, after nearly a century of oppression by the
white minority governments of South Africa and after forty -five years o f racist legislation
by the National Party, has the process of negotiation to end ‘apartheid’ begun.
One of the reasons why it has been so difficult to mobilise international
opposition to this vicious and evil system based on racism is the lack of any h istorical
perspective against which to judge it. It is as if the sudden "U -turn" (I refuse to call it a
conversion) of President de Klerk and his party were simply due to a pragmatic and
realistic political decision: a decision based on the obvious fact t hat South Africa could
not re -enter the open market of the world community whilst still practising and upholding
a racist ideology. So, to gain essential investment and development capital, `apartheid'
must be ended. The world has been only too ready to interpret all this as a proof of the
highmindedness of President de Klerk and the rightness of the policies of those Western
powers -particularly Great Britain -who have consistently opposed the imposition of
economic, cultural and sporting sanctions on South Africa as the one non -violent means
of ending ‘apartheid.’
It is only a truly historical perspective that can put things straight. And in this
immensely important book Enuga Reddy and Gopal Gandhi have put us all in their debt.
Here for the firs t time the true significance of Mohandas Gandhi's sojourn in South
Africa has been spelt out. And it is urgent that, at this present time of negotiation for a
truly democratic, non -racist society based on human rights and human dignity, Gandhiji's
contribu tion should be recognised and honoured.
How many people in the western world even know that he spent twenty -one years
in South Africa? That it was in these years that Gandhiji's concept and technique of non -
violent defiance originated? That, as far back as 1906 he decided to defy the humiliating
Asiatic Ordinance, whatever the consequences? But, even more significant is the way in
which that concept of non -violent resistance to tyranny (in whatever form) has influenced
the struggle for freedom across the face of the earth. We have seen it in the civil rights
movements, the defiance campaigns, the non -violent rebellion in Eastern Europe -in
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and the Soviet Union itself. But most of all, I would dare
to affirm, we have seen it in the long years of struggle in South Africa itself. And of this
I can speak with some authority since, from 1943 till the present moment, I have been
involved in the Anti -Apartheid Movement. Until 1956, when I became a most reluctant
exile, I was direct ly participating in that non -violent struggle. I was present at a
momentous gathering, known as ‘The Congress of the People’ at Kliptown, just outside
Johannesburg, in 1955. It was there that, clause by clause, the Freedom Charter was
passed and has been ever since the basic political and philosophical and ethical document
of the African National Congress. Like the choice of the word ‘Congress’ the essence of
the Freedom Charter is Gandhian. Similarly, in the struggle for liberation itself, non -violence ha s continued to be the chosen method of resistance to the evil of ‘apartheid.’
Whilst it is true that after the Sharpeville massacre the ‘armed struggle’ -strictly
defensive, as Nelson Mandela has always defined it -became for the first time since
1912 -13one element in the strategy of liberation, it was never the only or even the
predominant way to freedom. The Negotiating Process now begun and the Peace Accord
now signed between virtually all the conflicting parties are a proof -if such is needed -
that Gandhiji's life and work in South Africa have been triumphant. Shortly before his
own death, in May 1947, Dr. Yusuf Dadoo and Dr. G. M. Naicker, both South African
Asians, visited Gandhiji and he told them, "The slogan today is no longer merely ‘Asia
for the Asians’ or ‘Africa for the Africans’ but the unity of all the oppressed races of the
earth."
It is impossible, in a brief Foreword, to do justice to this massive and wide -
ranging book. But it will surely become the definite account of those twenty -one years in
which the influence of Gandhiji was fundamental to the development of the whole
freedom struggle. To know thathistory is to understand the history of the present
moment. And to understand its significance for peace, not only in South Africa , but in
the world, is an essential duty for all who care about the future of our planet Earth.
I pray that this book may be read by those who have responsibilities in the
government of nations, but, even more, by those in universities and schools who wi ll be
the inheritors of the world which is yet to be.
December 1991 Trevor Huddleston CRINTRODUCTION
Gandhiji left South Africa on July 18, 1914, after spending almost 21 years in that
country as an attorney and public worker. He wrote as he s ailed toward London:
"I have left South Africa, but not my connection with that country." ( Indian
Opinion , August 26, 1914).
It was in South Africa that Gandhiji had realised his vocation in life. It was there that
he invented and practised sat yagraha. It was in South Africa that not only his philosophy
of life but his attitude to the social problems of India crystallised.
Gandhiji often asserted that he was an Indian and a South African. He told his prayer
meeting in New Delhi on June 28, 1946, that he was born in India but was made in South
Africa. (Item 214). He said at another prayer meeting in Poona on July 10, 1946:
"...in a way I belong to South Africa, having passed twenty years of the best
part of my life there." (Item 218)
Dr. Y. M. Dadoo and Dr. G. M. Naicker, leaders of the passive resistance movement in
South Africa, met Gandhiji on April 11, 1947. He said to them:
"Truly speaking, it was after I went to South Africa that I became what I am
now. My love for South Af rica and my concern for her problems are no less than
for India..." (Item 233)
On January 28, 1948, two days before he was assassinated, he told a prayer meeting in
New Delhi: "I have myself lived in South Africa for twenty years and I can therefore say
that it is my country." (Item 244). Gandhiji reminisced on South Africa even in his last
public speech, at the prayer meeting the day before he was assassinated.
The South African experience left a deep and lasting impression on Gandhiji and
influenced the Indian national movement that he was to lead. As he began to lead local
and then national struggles in India, Gandhiji often recalled his South African experience
as a frame of reference for the direction of the struggles in India.
In So uth Africa, Gandhiji became convinced of the invincibility of non -violent
resistance to evil, if properly led. He developed strong convictions on the need for the
elimination of untouchability, Hindu -Muslim unity, national language, prohibition,
respect f or manual labour, promotion of spinning and cottage industries etc.
He had encouraged the participation of women in the last decisive phase of the struggle
in 1913 and was gratified by the way they had acquitted themselves and inspired others.
He wa s so impressed by the heroism of the poor workers that he said in London on
August 8, 1914:"These men and women are the salt of India; on them will be built the Indian
nation that is to be."
***
He continued to follow the situation in South Africa until the end of his life, and to
respond to appeals from the Indian community as it faced ever new measures of
discrimination and harassment. He wrote and spoke extensively on the plight of Indians
in South Africa, built public opinion and promot ed public and governmental action in
support of their legitimate rights. Towards the end of his life, he gave guidance and
support to the Indian passive resistance movement in South Africa (1946 -48), which
was to inspire all the oppressed people and lea d to the emergence of the great national
movement of that country.
The time and effort that Gandhiji spent on support to the Indians in South Africa, and
his views on developments in South Africa after his departure from that country, are,
however, not sufficiently known, as no collection of the relevant speeches, articles and
letters has been available.
The present collection is being published on the eve of the centenary of his voyage to
South Africa and at a time when we, in India, can look forward to fruitful and friendly
relations with a new South Africa. It will, we hope, promote a greater understanding
between the peoples of India and South Africa whose national movements have been
intimately linked for almost a century.
* * *
The struggle for human dignity led by Gandhiji in South Africa may be briefly
reviewed here as it had a lasting impact on South Africa and India and forms the
background for this volume.
A year after he arrived in South Africa as a 23 -year-oldbarrister, Gandhiji decided to
devote himself to serving the Indian community which was subjected to discrimination
and humiliation by the white rulers. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Natal
Indian Congress in 1894 and the Transvaal British Indian Association in 1903.
For over a decade, he prepared numerous petitions and memoranda, led deputations to
the authorities, wrote letters to the press and tried to promote public understanding and
support -in South Africa, as well as in Indi a and Britain -for the cause of the Indians in
South Africa. His professional practice also came to be largely devoted to the same cause.
At that time, Gandhiji had entertained faith in the fairness of the British and in
Imperial principles. But it became clear by 1906 that appeals and petitions had proved
ineffective and promises had been betrayed. The Transvaal Asiatic Ordinance of 1906,
requiring all Indians to register and carry passes, was the last straw. He decided not tosubmit to this unjust and evil measure. The Indian community in the province took a
solemn pledge at a large meeting on July 31, 1906, to defy the law.
The Ordinance was denied Royal assent after an Indian deputation (Gandhiji and Haji
Ojer Ali) appealed to the Imperia l authorities in London. But self -government was
granted to the Transvaal at the beginning of 1907 and it enacted the terms of the
Ordinance in the Asiatic Registration Act of 1907.
The first Satyagraha , or the campaign of non -violent defiance, beg an in July 1907
when that Act came into force. About 150 persons courted imprisonment by defying the
Act and picketing registration offices. This initial phase of the campaign ended at the end
of January 1908 when General Smuts and Gandhiji reached a provi sional settlement
under which the Indians would register voluntarily and the Government would repeal the
law.
Thesatyagraha had to be resumed in July 1908 when the Government reneged on the
promise to repeal the Act. Over two thousand people, from t he small Indian population
of less than ten thousand in the Transvaal, as well as some Indians from the Natal, went
to prison defying the Registration Act and an immigration law which restricted inter -
provincial movement by Indians.
The movement was suspended in 1911 during talks with the government of the newly -
established Union of South Africa. But the talks proved fruitless. The Union
Government repudiated a promise it made to Gopal Krishna Gokhale, in 1912, to abolish
the £3 annual tax w hich Natal had imposed on indentured labourers who did not re -
indenture or return to India at the expiration of their contracts. And in 1913, the Cape
Supreme Court declared virtually all Indian marriages invalid, by deciding that only
marriages perform ed under Christian rites and duly registered were valid. The
Government ignored appeals by the Indian community for legislation to validate the
marriages.
Gandhiji then decided on a resumption of the satyagraha, both in the Transvaal and in
Natal. Th e abolition of the £3 tax and the validation of marriages were added to the
demands of the satyagraha.
During this last stage, the movement was joined by workers and women who were
directly affected by the £3 tax and the judgment on marriages, and it became a mass
movement. People of all religious persuasions -Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians -
and of varied occupations -merchants, hawkers, professionals, workers and indentured
labourers -came together in this righteous struggle.
"The who le community rose like a surging wave. Without organisation, without
propaganda, all -nearly 40,000 -courted imprisonment. Nearly ten thousand were
actually imprisoned... A bloodless revolution was effected after strenuous
discipline in self -suffering." (Gandhiji in Young India , April 20, 1921; Collected
Works , Volume 20, page 15).Gandhiji and his colleagues were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The
strikers were rendered leaderless. The army, police and the employers were ruthless in
attempts to coerce the workers and suppress the strike. The striking miners were
confined in mine compounds turned into prisons and subjected to cruel assaults.
Indentured labourers on sugar plantations were beaten and fired at. Several workers were
killed. B ut the strikers remained firm and disciplined; equally significant, they did not
deviate from non -violence. John Dube, the first President -General of the African
National Congress, gave a moving eye -witness account of an incident in which 500
strikers at Phoenix would not move despite whipping, beating with sticks and rifle butts,
running of horses over the crowd, torture and killing of their leader, and firing. (Raojibhai
M. Patel, Gandhijiki Sadhana , 1939).
A notable aspect of this phase of the cam paign was the active participation of women.
Gandhiji's wife Kasturba -who was then in poor health and living on a diet of fruit alone
-led the way along with several relatives. Gandhiji wrote in Satyagraha in South Africa :
"I knew that the step of sending women (from Phoenix settlement) to jail was
fraught with serious risk. Most of the sisters in Phoenix spoke Gujarati. They
had not had the training or experience of the Transvaal sisters. Moreover, most of
them were related to me, and might t hink of going to jail only on account of my
influence with them. If afterwards they flinched at the time of actual trial or could
not stand the jail, they might be led to apologise, thus not only giving me a deep
shock but also causing serious damage to t he movement. I decided not to broach
the subject to my wife, as she could not say no to any proposal I made, and if she
said yes, I would not know what value to attach to her assent, and as I knew that
in a serious matter like this the husband should leav e the wife to take what step
she liked on her own initiative, and should not be offended at all even if she did
not take any step whatever. I talked to the other sisters who readily fell in with
my proposal and expressed their readiness to go to jail. Th ey assured me that they
would complete their term in jail, come what might. My wife overheard my
conversation with the sisters, and addressing me, said, 'I am sorry that you are not
telling me about this. What defect is there in me which disqualifies me for jail? I
also wish to take the path to which you are inviting the others.` I replied, 'there is
no question of my distrust in you. I would be only too glad if you went to jail, but
it should not appear at all as if you went at my instance. In matte rs like this every
one should act relying solely upon one's own strength and courage. If I asked
you, you might be inclined to go just for the sake of complying with my request.
And then if you began to tremble in the law court or were terrified by hards hips in
jail, I could not find fault with you, but how would it stand with me? How could I
then harbour you or look the world in the face? It is fears like these which have
prevented me from asking you too to court jail.` 'You may have nothing to do
with me`, she said, 'if being unable to stand jail I secure my release by an apology.
If you can endure hardships and so can my boys, why cannot I? I am bound to
join the struggle.` 'Then I am bound to admit you to it`, said I. 'You know my
conditions and you know my temperament. Even now reconsider the matter ifyou like, and if after mature thought you deliberately come to the conclusion not
to join the movement, you are free to withdraw. And you must understand that
there is nothing to be ashamed of i n changing your decision even now.` 'I have
nothing to think about, I am fully determined`, she said..."
The women from the Phoenix Settlement and those from the Transvaal were not
arrested for several days and they travelled around, encouraging the workers to strike.
Kasturba came out of prison emaciated. Valliamma, a 16 -year-old girl, insisted on
serving her full term in prison despite serious illness and died a few days after release.
Public opinion all over India was aroused. The Viceroy, L ord Hardinge, expressed
sympathy with the satyagrahis: the Indian and British Governments intervened and the
South African Government was forced to negotiate.
Thesatyagraha ended with the Smuts -Gandhi agreement of June 30, 1914, under
which all the demands of the satyagraha were conceded.1
The concept of Satyagraha soon assumed world historic importance.
***
In a letter to Indians in South Africa, which he wrote on the eve of his departure from
that country and signed "the community's inde ntured labourer," Gandhiji said:
"Though I am leaving for the motherland, I am not likely to forget South
Africa. I should like friends who may have occasion to go to India to come and
see me there. I do intend, of course, to work in India in regard to the disabilities
here..."
He kept his promise.
While he was leading the Indian people in South Africa, their motherland and many of
its leaders had lent support. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, in particular, had done much, with a
"single -minded and selfless devotion," even to the detriment of his health. Gandhiji, after
his return to India, took the mantle of Gokhale. His services proved essential as an anti -
Asiatic movement gained strength in South Africa.
1The demands were: (1) Repeal o f the Asiatic Act;
(2) Removal of racial or colour disqualification from
legislation on immigration; (3) Validation of Indian
marriages; (4) Removal of annual poll tax of three pounds
imposed by a Natal law in 1898 on ex -indentured labourers
and their fami lies; and (5) Just administration of existing
laws with due regard to vested rights.Gandhiji had been encouraged by wha t he saw as a change in attitude of the South
African Government during the negotiations in 1914. He understood that the settlement
with General Smuts implied that no racial distinction would be made in any legislation
affecting the Indian community. Wit h the protection of vested rights, and the promise of
generosity in administering existing laws, he hoped for a steady improvement of the
position of the resident Indians, especially since the Europeans had no more reason to
fear of unrestricted Indian im migration.
The Smuts -Gandhi Agreement had dealt only with certain specific issues which hurt
the self -respect of the Indian community and formed the points of the satyagraha . There
remained numerous other discriminatory measures and grievances. G andhiji had made it
clear -in his letter of June 30, 1914, which forms part of the agreement -that Indians
"could not be expected to rest content until full civil rights had been restored." But he
believed that the objective could now be achieved by a process of education of European
opinion and the intercession of Indian and British Governments which had participated
in the negotiations of 1914. (Item 1).
Gandhiji's hopes for an amelioration of the situation of Indians in South Africa were,
however, short -lived. An anti -Asiatic agitation began within a few years after he left
South Africa, and he received frequent appeals from the Indian community for help. He
tried to do his best, despite his immense preoccupations in India, to publicise the
situation, and persuade the Indian Government to act.
He felt rather powerless and despondent after 1920 as he lost faith in the British
Imperial professions and became a non -co-operator. As he wrote in Young India of
March 20, 1924, he developed "utter distrust of the British Imperial system."
"... I am able no longer to rely upon verbal or written promises made by
persons working under that system and in their capacity as officials or supporters.
The history of Indian emigrants to South Afri ca, East Africa and Fiji is a history
of broken promises and of ignominious surrender of their trust by the Imperial
Government and the Indian Government, whenever it has been a question of
conflicting interests of Europeans against Indians."
He could onl y try to exert some influence by promoting public agitation in India.
In that situation, his valued friend, the Reverend C.F. Andrews, proved a great asset.
The latter took special interest in the position of Indians overseas. He made several visits
to South Africa at critical times and played a significant role in rallying support for the
Indian cause from European churchmen, media and liberals. A visit to South Africa in
1924 by Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, another close associate of Gandhiji, was also mos t helpful.
After a round table conference in Cape Town in 1926 -27, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, for
whom Gandhiji had great respect, was appointed Agent of the Government of India in
South Africa; he sought the advice of Gandhiji and helped persuade the South African
Government to redress some grievances of the Indians.Gandhiji warned several times that the weapon of satyagraha had to be kept alive. It
was only when the Indian community in South Africa was prepared to suffer and sacrifice
that it could mo uld its own destiny. Mere diplomatic action could only obtain
compromises mitigating new discriminatory measures, accepting what was feasible in the
context of white racist opinion and agitation, but could not prevent a steady deterioration
of the legal p osition of the Indians.
By 1939 a new leadership emerged in South Africa with the conviction that the rights
of the Indian community can only be defended by struggle and sacrifice. It pledged to
emulate Gandhiji's own experience in South Africa and sacrifice for the honour and
dignity of the Indian people. Dr. Yusuf M. Dadoo, who became chairman of a Council of
Action in the Transvaal, appealed to Gandhiji for his blessings for a passive resistance
campaign.
Gandhiji was impressed by the sincer ity Dr. Dadoo. While he advised postponement of
passive resistance at that time, pending efforts by the Indian Government for an
honourable compromise, he gave moral support to resistance. The passive resistance
campaign had to be deferred, however, except for a token satyagraha in 1941,
especially by persons who had been associated with Gandhiji and their descendants.
A nation -wide passive resistance was launched in June 1946, under the leadership of
Dr. Dadoo in the Transvaal and Dr. G. M. Naicke r in Natal, when the Asiatic Land
Tenure and Indian Representation Act -the "Ghetto Act" -came into force. Gandhiji lent
them guidance and valuable support until the end of his life.
* * *
Reference must be made to the attitude of Gandhiji towards Indian -African relations in
South Africa, especially on co -operation in the struggle for freedom.
Gandhiji had dedicated himself in South Africa to serving the small Indian community
which was being subjected to discriminatory and humiliating measu res in breach of
undertakings by the British and colonial governments, in violation of acquired rights and
in disregard of professions of British Imperial policy. The Transvaal Asiatic Registration
Ordinance of 1906 came soon after thousands of Chinese wo rkers were summarily
deported from the Transvaal. There was reason to believe that the intention of the
authorities was to make the life of the Indians so miserable as to force all Indians, except
the indentured labourers, to leave. The Indians were vulne rable.
For Gandhiji, the issue was not only the specific grievances of the Indians but their
individual and national self -respect. Many Indian traders had earlier accepted
humiliations in order to make money, but that was not acceptable to Gandhiji. T he
satyagraha was a part of the struggle of India for its dignity, and a moral crusade, though
waged on the South African soil.The satyagraha was, therefore, confined to the Indian community. The small Chinese
community, which was also affected by th e anti -Asiatic legislation in the Transvaal,
carried on a parallel struggle. The grievances of the Asians were, however, of little direct
concern to the indigenous Africans and the Coloured people.
Gandhiji recognised that the root cause of the injus tice being perpetrated against the
Indians was the fact that the authorities in South Africa were representative of white
settlers only. But he felt that the Indian settlers or indentured labourers could not change
the political system in the country: tha t was a task for the natives of the soil. He did not at
that stage call for full political rights for the Indians, but only for civil rights and for the
removal of any "colour bar" in legislation.
He made great efforts to inform the white community of the cause of the Indians in
order to secure their understanding and support. He maintained friendly contacts with
African leaders, and expressed full sympathy for their aspirations, but neither conceived
of a joint struggle for full political rights at t hat stage.
Gandhiji foresaw already, according to his first biographer, the Reverend J. J. Doke, the
coming confrontation between the African people and the whites. He said:
"When the moment of collision comes, if, instead of the old ways of mass acre,
assegai and fire, the Natives adopt the policy of Passive Resistance, it will be a
grand change for the Colony ..."
After his return to India in 1914, when Gandhiji devoted much of his time to mobilise
Indian public opinion in support of the Ind ians in South Africa, he repeatedly stressed
that the Indians should maintain amicable relations with the Africans and should not
press any claims if they conflicted with the interests of the African majority, they should
not be pressed. That message wa s also carried to South Africa by his associates, the
Reverend C. F. Andrews and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu.
In 1928, commenting on a report that some Indians in South Africa favoured
separation from Africans in education, Gandhiji wrote in Young India onApril 5, 1928:
"Indians have too much in common with the Africans to think of isolating
themselves from them. They cannot exist in South Africa for any length of time
without the active sympathy and friendship of the Africans. I am not aware of the
general body of the Indians having ever adopted an air of superiority towards their
African brethren, and it would be a tragedy if any such movement were to gain
ground among the Indian settlers of South Africa."
Gandhiji was cautious in responding to suggestions by militant Indian leaders in the
1930s for a united struggle by African, Coloured and Indian people. He did not receive
timely information when a Non -European United Front was formed in Cape Town in
1939, and came under criticism for expressi ng reservations about an Indo -African united
front. But his reasoning was significant.He told the Reverend S. S. Tema, a member of the African National Congress, in an
interview on January 1, 1939:
"The Indians are a microscopic minority. They can never be a menace to the
white population. You, on the other hand, are the sons of the soil who are being
robbed of your inheritance. You are bound to resist that. Yours is a far bigger
issue. It ought not to be mixed up with that of the Indian. This d oes not preclude
the establishment of the friendliest relations between the two races."
As sentiment for unity grew among the Africans and Indians, Gandhiji revised his
views. He showed no hesitation in supporting Dr. Yusuf M. Dadoo, a leader of NEUF, in
his efforts to build unity of Indians and Africans in resistance to unjust laws, warning
only that the movement should remain strictly non -violent.
In July 1946, when white gangsters were brutally attacking Indian passive resisters in
Durban, Ga ndhiji told the All India Congress Committee that he would not shed a single
tear if all the Indian satyagrahis were wiped out, for they would thereby point the way to
the Africans and vindicate the honour of India. ( Harijan , July 21, l946).
In May 19 47, when Dr. Yusuf Dadoo and Dr. G. M. Naicker, the Presidents of the
Transvaal and Natal Indian Congresses, visited him in India after signing a pact of co -
operation with the African National Congress, he gave them a message in which he said:
"Politi cal co -operation among all exploited races in South Africa can only
result in mutual good if wisely directed."

1914 -1918
Editors' Note
When Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi left South Africa for London on July 18, 1914, he
was forty -five and already a celebrity. "M. K. Gandhi, Attorney" to his clients and to the
authorities, he was "Gandhibhai" to his large and g rowing circle of friends in the Indian
community of South Africa.
He had lived two decades in that country of black, brown and white populations,
writing, speaking, organising and practising law with restless zeal.
Restless and unremittingly preo ccupied as he was, an inner stillness permeated him, a
calm self -assurance. Ex -indentured labourers, tradespeople and professionals looked
upon him as one who had ministered to their personal, professional and political needs.
The Tolstoy Farm and Phoeni x Settlement set up by Gandhiji were places which invited
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Jews and Parsis, speaking many languages -Tamil, Telugu,
Hindi, Gujarati and Urdu -to live self -sufficiently and selflessly in a society of chaste
human fellowship. Gandhiji was like the head of a family in these settlements, guiding
and instructing the inmates and, of course, working at the same time for the cause he had
given to himself: the vouchsafing of the dignity of Indians in South Africa and the honour
of Ind ia.
After three major campaigns spread over eight years during which the term
"satyagraha" came to be "invented and employed," Gandhiji was able to secure the
"Smuts -Gandhi Agreement" of 1914. This settled the long -drawn and bitterly contested
issue of the validity in South Africa of the marriages which were held legal in India (with
some qualifications in regard to plural marriages). It also abolished the annual tax of £3
on ex -indentured labourers and their wives and children and obtained the prom ise that
existing laws will be administered in a just manner and with due regard to vested rights.
In the conclusion to his book Satyagraha in South Africa , written sometime in 1924,
Gandhiji observed:
"Thus the great Satyagraha struggle closed after eight years, and it appeared
that the Indians in South Africa were now at peace. On July 18, 1914, I sailed for
England, to meet Gokhale, on my way back to India, with mixed feelings of
pleasure and regret, -pleasure because I was returning home a fter many years and
eagerly looked forward to serving the country under Gokhale's guidance, regret
because it was a great wrench for me to leave South Africa, where I had passed
twenty -one years of my life sharing to the full in the sweets and bitters of h uman
experience, and where I had realised my vocation in life."At a reception that was hosted in his honour at London on August 8, 1914, Gandhiji
spoke with fervour of the sacrifices made by his compatriots and fellow -satyagrahis in
South Africa. He was unstinting in his acknowledgement of the role played by General
Smuts, then Minister of the Interior, in bringing the Smuts -Gandhi compact into effect.
But he had no illusions about the future. "Grievances remain," he made it clear, "which
will hav e to be redressed in no distant future. But I hope it will not be by way of passive
resistance..."
A startling statement from one who had created the instrument of satyagraha and
wielded it with palpable success. But Gandhiji had his reasons for "r eserving"
satyagraha to the role of an ultimate weapon. "They (the grievances) are capable of
settlement by pressure of Indian opinion, by pressure from Downing street and from
Delhi or Calcutta," he said to his London audience. (Item 1).
This optimism was not to last long. Although the Indian community won praise for
raising a volunteer ambulance corps to serve under General Smuts in East Africa during
the First World War, irritating new discriminatory measures were introduced even before
the War ended.
Gandhiji warned as early as 1917 that the Indian community must be prepared to
resume passive resistance. He wrote in a letter to Indian Opinion on December 15, 1917:
"I note... that our people in South Africa are not yet free from difficulties about
trade licences and leaving certificates. My Indian experience has confirmed the
opinion that there is no remedy like passive resistance against such evils. The
community has to exhaust milder remedies, but I hope that it will not allow t he
sword of passive resistance to get rusty." (Item 10).
Setting up, within months of his return to India, the Sabarmati Ashram near
Ahmedabad, Gandhiji continued the pattern of the Phoenix Settlement. But, as with
Phoenix, the ashram was only the ba se for his activities. These grew apace and extended
to the tackling of wrongs throughout the length and breadth of the country.
The indigo cultivators at Champaran, the textile workers at Ahmedabad and the
peasants of Kheda gave him cause in 1917 -18for the launching of highly successful,
though localised, satyagraha campaigns which contained in them clear signs of their
South African lineage.
1. SPEECH AT LONDON RECEPTION, AUGUST 8, 19142
2Gandhiji, Mrs. Kasturba Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach arrived in London on
August 4, 1914, and were given a reception at Hotel Cecil by British and Indian
friends on Aug ust 8th. Among those present were Mrs. Sarojini Naidu,...It is impossible to express in adequate terms the sense of gratitude which Mrs.
Gandhi and I feel to you all. We come among you almost as barbarians. We have lived
isolated on a little farm, cut off from the cities. That is why I said we were "barbarians."
We have worked in the limelight, and you have se en what we have done in exaggerated
form. If we merit any approbation, how much more those behind us, who went into the
battle with simple faith, with no thought of appreciation.
What will you say to Harbat Singh, an ex -indentured Indian, 75 years of age, who was
with me at Volksrust Gaol? He was 6 feet tall and of noble carriage. "Why have you
come?" I asked. "How could I help it?" was the reply. "In the evening of my days I am
content to pass the rest of my life in prison to deliver my countrymen." H e remained in
gaol and died there.3
What do you think of the young lad, Narayanswamy, whose parents came from what is
falsely called the "Benighted Presidency," Madras? He had never seen India except as a
deportee; he starved for some days when he re turned. He died.4
And what of Nagappan, another lad from Madras who suffered imprisonment. He
worked as a prisoner on the African veldt in the bitter cold of winter, in the early morning
when there was no sun. You know what the cold of a London winter is like, but few of
you know the biting cold of the early mornings of winter on the veldt. Unfit for work, he
still held on, but at last he died.5
Then there is Sister Valliamma, a girl of 18. She went to prison and was only
discharged when she was v ery ill. I remember well when Mr. Polak6and I went to see her;
how we lifted her with greatest care on to her carpet, and tended her to the best of our
powers. She died, leaving thousands of Indians in South Africa to mourn the loss.7
There were 20,0 00 strikers who left their tools and work because there was something
in the air. People said they did not know why they had struck. There was a half -truth in
that saying; they went out in faith. Violence was entirely eschewed. These men and

died in Delgoa Bay on October 16, 1910.

But victory is due not only to their work. They quickened the conscience of the Empire
and of South Africa. Success was due a lso to the help given by the Motherland in the
hour of trial of her sons and daughters, led by that saintly politician, Gopal Krishna
Gokhale;8to the stand made by India; and to the action of that great Viceroy, Lord
Hardinge.9Success would, however, hav e been impossible had not the conscience of
South Africa been quickened, had not the people realised the moral force which Indians
could bring to bear against brute force.
Marching over the veldt last November, Europeans came to our aid. I have spoken
elsewhere of unreasonable and unreasoning prejudice; but the masses stood aside; they
never worried us; and during the march they helped us and showed us practical sympathy.
The Botha Government, too, "played the game." Mr. Smuts10said to me: "We do not
want any misunderstanding; we want all the cards on the table. Take these documents;
read them; come to me again and again if you are not satisfied; we will make changes."
And he did.
You see many things conspired to enable the Settlement11to be made. But I must
mention one more: Mr. Andrews.12You have no notion what he did; how he worked in
selfless zeal, preaching love for India through his Master -the poet -saint at Bolpur whom
I have come to know through Mr. Andrews -Rabindranath Tagore.13
I have called the Settlement the Magna Charta of the British Indians of South Africa;
8For a tribute to Mr. Gokhale, please see items 6 and 9 below.
9Lord Hardinge, Viceroy from 1910 to 1916, in a speech in Madras on November
23, 1913, publicly expressed his sympathy with th e struggle of the Indian people
in South Africa. (Please see item 6).
He persuaded the British Government to intervene and, when the South African
Government appointed a Commission to look into Indian grievances, sent a senior
civil servant, Sir Benja min Robertson, to give evidence on behalf of the
Government of India before the Commis sion and to promote a settlement.

Union of South Africa
11The Smuts -Gandhi settlement was reached by an ex change of letters on June 30,
1914.
12The Reverend C. F. Andrews (1871 -1940), sent by Mr. Gokhale, arrived in
South Africa in January 1914 and greatly assisted in promoting a settlement. He
was closely associated with Poet Rabindranath Ta gore.
13Poet, writer and philosopher, Rabindranath Tagore established, at Bolpur,
Santiniketan and Viswa Bharati University, where the Reverend C.F. Andrews
was a professor.after due deliberation I repeat my statement. It is the Magna Charta of British Indians,
not only because of its substance, which is great enough, but for its spirit, which indicates
a change of attitude on the part of South Africa and the South African Government. The
sufferings of our countrymen sealed the Settlement. The discovery was made that the
ancient force could be applied in South Africa; conviction came afte r the sufferings of
eight long -drawn -out years. They saw that Indians, when in earnest, were irresistible; that
they would not take a bit less than the minimum they demanded.
Mr. Cartwright14is here; he has been our staunch friend throughout and I hon our him
for his help. But I tell him here that he almost tried to weaken us. I remember, and he
will remember, how he came to me in Johannesburg Gaol, and said: "Will not this letter
do?" "No, Mr. Cartwright," was my reply; "not until this alteration is m ade." "But
everything is achieved by compromise," he urged. "There can be no compromise on
principles," I answered. There never was any compromise on principles from 1906 to
1914.
The Settlement is final on all the points of our passive resistance, bu t not of all our
grievances. Grievances remain which will have to be redressed in no distant future. But I
hope it will not be by way of passive resistance. They are capable of settlement by
pressure of Indian public opinion, by pressure from Downing Stree t, and from Delhi or
Calcutta. The attitude of South Africa has changed; that is our great asset. On our
behaviour depends the future settlement in South Africa...

2. THE LA STSATYAGRAHA CAMPAIGN: MY EXPERIENCE15
14Albert Cartwright, editor of the Transvaal Leader and member of the
Progressiv e Party, helped promote the provisional settlement between General
Smuts and Gandhiji in January 1908 when Gandhiji served his first term in prison.
He was a leader of the Committee of European Sympathisers formed in 1908 to
support the Indian cause.
15Gandhiji started writing this article on board the ship Kinfauns Castle , on which
he left South Africa for England in July 1914. The preface was written on July 23,
1914. The main article was delayed because of his illness and other
preoccupations in L ondon, and was published in a special issue of Indian Opinion
in December 1914 devoted to satyagraha .
He gave a fuller account of the satyagraha in his book, Satyagraha in
South Africa , which he wrote mostly in Yeravda jail where he was incar cerated
from 1922 to 1924. But this article has a value as this account was written while
the struggle was still very fresh in his mind.Preface
I have left South Africa, but not my connection with that land. I said in many of my
speeches during the final days that I would not give up that connection. My writings in
Indian Opinion will furnish s ome proof of my keeping the promise. In them, I shall
express my thoughts from time to time, hoping that readers will like them and find them
useful as well.
I am commencing this article on board the Kinfauns Castle . Five days have passed
since we le ft the Cape...
The love of our Indian brethren in their thousands and the honour they accorded us are
constantly in our minds. That love reminds me of the wonderful power of the soul and its
extraordinary properties. The functions at Durban, Verulam, Johannesburg, Kimberley
and Pretoria are, we find, impossible to forget. The Cape Town friends, moreover, placed
us under a crushing burden of gratitude by taking out a procession. Where so many
showed such immeasurable love, whom shall we thank by name? T he white people, too,
made an excellent demonstration of their affection. During the final days, we drank the
cup of their love also full to the brim. Occasions such as these prove that there is no bar
or permanent division as between the whites and Colour eds and that, if both the sides
make the required effort, the evil in South Africa can be overcome. If one side at least
were to practise satyagraha on every occasion and in every manner, it is my firm faith,
borne out by experience, that even such effort, one-sided as it would be, would suffice to
remove the evil of colour -bar. So much by way of preface.

Account of the last satyagraha campaign
During the la st campaign, the very highest limit was reached. I have had simply no
time to write of the experience. I had meant to share it with the readers of Indian
Opinion . They will remember that the last struggle was, as it were, the third chapter in the
story of satyagraha .16When the first chapter came to a close, we, at any rate I, had
16Gandhiji refers here to the three stages of the Satyagraha .
The first stage, which began with the decision of 1 906 to defy the Asiatic
Ordinance in the Transvaal (replaced by the Asiatic Registration Act of 1907),
ended with the provisional settlement with General Smuts on January 30, 1908.
The second stage began with the resumption of the Satyagraha in July 1 908,
when General Smuts reneged on the promise to repeal the obnoxious Act. Some
Indians from Natal joined the struggle by defying the Transvaal Immigrationthought that it was definitely the last. When the time came for the second chapter to open
many friends said to me: "Now who will fight? The community cannot be expected to put
forth so much strength every time." I laughed when I heard this. My faith in truth was
unshakeable and I replied, "The people, having tasted once the joy of struggle, will fight
now with even greater zeal." And that was precisely what happened. On the first occasion,
a hundred or two hundred Indians went to gaol. The second time, not only did hundreds
court imprisonment, but the whole of Natal woke up and leaders came from there to join
the struggle. The fight dragged on, but the morale never went down and w e advanced.
When it came to launching the last fight, I heard only talk of defeat. "Every time the
Government deceives you," they said, "and you allow yourself to be imposed upon and
the people’s interests suffer. This will never do." I had to listen to bi tter words like these.
I knew only too well that neither I nor anyone else had any remedy against the
Government’s foul play. If, after we have accepted a promissory note, the signa tory
refuses to honour it or confesses his inability to do so, how are we to blame? To me it
was clear that, if the Government broke its promise, though we would have to put in
greater efforts, it would have to yield all the more. The longer the time taken to repay a
debt, the heavier the burden becomes. This unalterable law app lies to both material and
moral obligations. My reply at that time was, " Satyagraha is a kind of struggle in which
there can be no defeat and no cause for regret. A man can only become stronger through
the struggle. He suffers no exhaustion and at every st age he gains fresh strength. If truth
be on our side, the Indian community will work harder this time and earn an even more
glorious name." When I made this reply, I never dreamt that 20,000 poor Indians would
arise and make their own and their country’s n ame immortal. General Botha17observed
in the course of a speech that the whites had not been able to start and conduct the kind
of strike that the Indians had done this time. This fight was joined by women and by
many young boys of sixteen, so that the ca mpaign became much more of a moral struggle.
South African Indians became the talk of the world. In India, rich and poor, young and
old, men and women, kings and labourers, Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians, citizens
of Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Lahor e-all were roused, became familiar with our
history and came to our assistance. The Government was taken aback. The Viceroy,
gauging the mood of the people, took their side. All this is public knowledge. I am stating
these facts here in order to show the importance of this struggle. My main purpose in
writing this article is to reveal certain details with which I am particularly familiar, which
are not known in India and even to Indian friends in South Africa.
Restriction Act of 1907. It continued until 1911 when it was suspended during
talks for a settleme nt.
The third stage began in September 1913. Women and indentured labourers
were encouraged to join the struggle as the validation of Indian marriages and the
abolition of the £3 tax were added to the demands, and the struggle extended
beyond the Tran svaal into Natal. It ended with the Smuts -Gandhi agreement of
June 30, 1914.
17General Louis Botha, Prime Minister of the Union of South
Africa, 1910 -19The training imparted in Tolstoy Farm18proved to be of great use in this last fight. The
mode of life accepted by the satyagrahis on the Farm became an invaluable asset in the
struggle. It was copied and improved upon in Phoenix.19When Tolstoy Farm was closed,
the pupils who wished to, came over to Phoenix.20The discipline was severe and there
was an understanding with each pupil and his parents that those of the pupils who chose
to live in Phoenix should, provided they were of a suitable age, join the struggle, if it was
launched again. To tell the truth, the education in Phoenix was for the most part a
preparation for satyagraha . The rules applied also to the families living in Phoenix. Only
one of them kept aloof. The result was that, leaving aside those engaged in running
Phoenix, all were ful ly prepared when the agitation started. Thus the third struggle began
with the residents of Phoenix. I shall never forget the scene when these men, women and
children marched out. Each had but one thought -that this was a holy war and that all
were settin g out on a pilgrimage. They set out singing hymns, one of which was the
famous "Let not thy mind be affected by joy or sorrow." The strains of music that issued
from the throats of those men, women and children still echo in my ears. The great Parsee
Rustomjee21was among this band. Many had thought that Mr. Rustomjee had suffered
so much in the previous struggle that he would not join this one. Those who said so did
not know his true greatness. That women and children should go forth and he stay behind
was unthinkable to him. Two other incidents of this period stand out in my memory.
There was an argument between Mr. Rustomjee and his lion -hearted son, Sorabjee, who
insisted that he would accompany his father. "Father, let me go in your place," he said,
"or take me along with you."
The second incident was the meeting between the late Hoosen Mian22and Rustomjee.
When Mr. Rustomjee went to see him, tears streamed from his eyes and he said,
"Kakaji ,23if I had been well, I would have accompanied you to gao l."Bhai24Hoosen
loved his country dearly; though bed -ridden, he gave full support to the struggle and
spoke constantly of it to all who visited him.
18The Tolstoy Farm at Lawley, Johannesburg, was given by Hermann
Kallenbac h in 1910 for the use of pas sive resisters and their families for the
duration of the struggle.
19Gandhiji had established the Phoenix Settlement near Durban in 1904, and
Indian Opinion was published there.
20The Tolstoy Farm was closed in January 1913, when an agreement on the
struggle in the Transvaal seemed imminent, and Gandhiji went to Phoenix with
the pupils in the school at the Tolstoy Farm and some passive resisters.

community and a close associate of Gandhiji. He repeatedly went to jail during

He was the son of Dawad Mahomed, a businessman an d leader of the Indian
community, who went to prison several times. On Dawad Mahomed, please see
item 30.
23Parsee Rustomjee was affectionately addressed as " Kakaji " (uncle).
24BrotherAmong those who remained behind in Phoenix were boys under sixteen. Although
they and the others who managed the affairs of Phoenix stayed out of prison, they did
better work than those who went to gaol. Day and night were one to them. They placed
themselves under the strictest vows till such time as their companions and elders should
be released, lived o n saltless diet and fearlessly took upon themselves even the most
onerous tasks. When the strike began in Victoria County, hundreds of indentured
labourers took shelter in Phoenix. To have looked after them was in itself a very great
achievement. It was eq ually an achievement to have gone on doing their work in
complete fearlessness in spite of the danger of raids by their masters. When the police
came and arrested Mr. West,25they prepared themselves for the possibility that others
might also be taken. But not a single person moved out of Phoenix. As I have said
already, only one family remained an exception. The Indian community can never truly
measure the services that the Phoenix workers rendered to it at that time. This secret
history has yet to be writ ten, that is why I am recording a part of it here in the hope that
some lover of truth might collect further information and might appreciate the services of
the Phoenix workers at their true worth.26I am very much tempted to write more, but I
drop Phoeni x here.
When the Phoenix batch went to prison, Johannesburg could not remain behind. The
women there became restive. They were fired with the desire to be in gaol. The entire
family of Mr. Thambi Naidoo27got ready. His wife, sister -in-law, mother -in-law, Mr.
Moorgan's relatives,28Mrs. P. K. Naidoo,29Valliamma who made herself immortal,30and
other women came forward. They marched forth with children in their arms. Mr.
Kallenbach31took them to Vereeniging. The idea was that, when they crossed the Free
State border and returned, they would be arrested.32Their expectations were not fulfilled.
25Albert H. West, one of the close European associates of Gandhiji, was Joint
Manager of the International Printing Press and of Indian Opinion . He was
briefly jailed in 1913 for helping indentured labourers who fled to the Phoenix
Settlement during the strike.

32Indians were not permitted to reside in the Free State. They could be arrested if
they crossed the Transvaal border as they had not re gistered under the Asiatic
Registration Act.They somehow managed to spend a few days in Vereeniging, where they tried to get
arrested by going round with baskets hawking, but they were left free.
This frust ration held within itself a glorious future.33If the women had been arrested in
Vereeniging itself, the strike might not have taken place; at any rate it would never have
reached the proportions it finally did. But the community was in the (protective) ha nd of
God. He is ever the protector of truth. When the women were not arrested, it was decided
that they cross the Natal border. If they were not arrested even there, they were to fix,
along with Mr. Thambi Naidoo, their headquarters at Newcastle. Accordin gly, they
proceeded to Natal. At the border, the police did not arrest them. They made their home
in Newcastle. There Mr. D. Lazarus34handed over his own house to the women; his wife
and sister -in-law, Miss Thomas, took it upon themselves to look to the co mforts of the
women satyagrahis .
The plan was that in Newcastle the women should meet the indentured labourers and
their wives, give them a true idea of their conditions and persuade them to go on strike on
the issue of the £ 3 tax. The strike was to commence on my arrival at Newcastle. But the
mere presence of these women was like a lighted match -stick to dry fuel. Women who
had never before slept except on soft beds and had seldom so much as opened their
mouths, now delivered public speeches among th e indentured labourers. The latter were
roused and, even before I arrived, were all for commencing the strike. The project was
full of risk. I got a wire from Mr. Naidoo. Mr. Kallenbach went to Newcastle and the
strike began. By the time I reached there, I ndians in two coal mines had already stopped
work.
I was sent for by the Committee of European Sympathisers presided over by Mr.
Hosken.35I met them. They approved of the strike and decided to support it. I stopped for
a day at Johannesburg and proce eded to Newcastle and stayed on there. I saw that the
people’s enthusiasm was tremendous. The Government could not tolerate the presence of
the women and finally they were sent to gaol as "vagabonds". The house of Mr. Lazarus
now became a dharmsala forsatyagrahis . Food had to be cooked there for hundreds of
indentured labourers. Mr. Lazarus was not to be daunted. The Indians in Newcastle
appointed a committee. Mr. Sidaat36was elected Chairman, and the work proceeded
33Literally, "immortal hope."

house consisting of two or three rooms... (he) belonged to a family of indentured

Gandhiji and several other satyagrahis stayed at his modest home in October
1913.
35A European Committee of Sympathisers was formed in 1908 to support the
Indian cause. William Hosken, a leader of the Pro gressive Party and former
President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Afri ca, was
Chairman.
36I. Seedatapace. Indians in other mines downed too ls.
Thus, as the strike by the Indian workers in the mines was spreading, a meeting of the
Mine -Owners’ Association was held. I was invited to attend. A great deal of discussion
ensued but no solution was found. Their proposal was that, if we called o ff the strike,
they would undertake to write to the Government about the £ 3 tax. This, the satyagrahis
could not agree to. We had no quarrel with the mine -owners. The object of the strike was
not to hurt them but rather to invite suffering on ourselves. A nd so the suggestion of the
owners was unacceptable. I returned to Newcastle. When I reported the result of this
meeting, enthusiasm mounted still higher. Work stopped in more mines.
Till then the workers had always resided at the mines where they worked. The
Council of Action in Newcastle felt that so long as the labourers continued to live on their
masters’ estates, the strike would not have its full effect. There was the risk that they
might be either tempted or coerced to resume work. Then aga in, to live in the master’s
house or eat his bread while refusing to work for him would be immoral. The workers’
continued stay on the mines was morally wrong. This last taint, it was felt, would sully
the purity of the satyagraha movement. On the other h and, to house and feed thousands
of Indians was a stupendous problem. Mr. Lazarus` house was now too small. The two
poor ladies had laboured night and day but found it impossible to cope with the work. It
was decided, even in the face of this, to adopt onl y the right course, whatever the cost.
Messages were sent to miners to stop work and proceed to Newcastle. The moment these
messages were received, an exodus from the mines began. Indians from the Belangi mine
were the first to arrive. It appeared as thoug h bands of pilgrims were daily streaming into
Newcastle. Men, young and old, women -some by themselves, others with children in
their arms -all arrived with bundles on their heads. The men, one saw, were carrying
trunks. Some arrived by day, others by ni ght and food had to be provided for them. How
can I describe the contentment of these poor people? They were pleased with what they
got, no matter how little. Rarely did one come across anyone with a downcast look. A
smile played on every face. To me they appeared to have come from among the 33
crores37of gods. The women were like goddesses. From where could shelter be provided
for all? For bedding, straw was spread on the earth and the sky was their roof. God was
their protector. Someone asked for a bidi.38I explained that they had come out, not as
indentured labourers, but as servants of India. They were taking part in a religious war
and at such a time they must abandon addictions such as drinking and smoking. Those
who were unable to give them up should not expect their requirements to be paid for from
the common coffers. The good men accepted this advice. I was never again asked for
money to buy a bidi. The exodus from the mines continued. One pregnant woman had a
miscarriage on the way. In spite of num berless hardships of this kind, no one gave up the
struggle or turned back.
There was a tremendous increase in the Indian population of Newcastle. The houses of
Indians were over -filled. The number made available was enough to accommodate
37A "crore " is ten million or 100 lakhs .
38Tobacco rolled by hand in a dry leaf and smoked like a cigarettewomen and old people. I must state here that the white people of Newcastle showed us
great courtesy, even sympathy. No Indian was harassed by them. One good lady even
gave her house free for our use; other assistance of a minor nature was also received from
a numbe r of whites all the time.
It was, however, not possible to keep thousands of Indians permanently in Newcastle.
The Mayor became apprehensive. The normal population of Newcastle is about three
thousand. An additional ten thousand could not be accommoda ted in such a town.
Labourers stopped work in other mines also. And so the question arose: what should be
done? The intention behind the strike was to court imprisonment. The Government could
have arrested the workers if it had so wished, but there were n ot enough prisons to house
those thousands. Hence, they had not so far touched the strikers. The one simple way left
to us now was to cross the Transvaal border and get arrested. We thought that the
congestion in Newcastle would thereby be relieved and the strikers could also be put to
the test. In Newcastle, the agents of the mine owners were trying to lure away the
workers. Not a single person had yielded; even so, it was the duty of the Council of
Action to keep them away from all temptation. It seemed d esirable, therefore, that they
should march from Newcastle to Charlestown. The distance is about 35 miles. To provide
railway fare for thousands was out of the question. It was therefore arranged that all able -
bodied men and women should do the journey on foot. The women who could not walk
were to be taken by train. There was a possibility of arrests on the way. Moreover, this
was the first experience of its kind for them. It was therefore decided that I should myself
take the first batch. It consisted of a bout 500 persons of whom 60 were women, with their
children. I shall never forget the scene. The company walked along raising cries of
"Victory to Dwarkanath, " "Victory to Ramachandra " and " Vande Mataram. " Each
person was given enough cooked rice and dalto last for two days. Everyone carried his
or her things in a bundle. The following conditions were read out to them:
1. It was probable that I would be arrested. Even if this happened, they were to march
on until arrested themselves. Though every effo rt would be made to provide them with
meals, etc., on the way, they should not mind, if by chance, food was not available on
some days.
2. For the duration of the struggle, they should abstain from drinks.
3. They must not retreat even in the fac e of death.
4. They should expect no shelter for night halts during the march, but should sleep on
the grass.
5. No trees or plants on the way should be harmed in the least nor should any article
belonging to others be touched.
6. If the Gov ernment’s police came to arrest anyone, the latter should willingly
surrender.7. No resistance should be offered to the police or any others; on the contrary, beating
should be patiently borne and no attempt should be made to protect oneself by offer ing
violence in return.
8. They should cheerfully bear the hardships in gaol and live there as if the gaol was a
palace.
There were persons of every caste and community in this pilgrim -band. There were
Hindus, Muslims, Brahmins ,Kshatriyas ,Vaishyas andSudras .39There were men from
Calcutta and there were Tamils. Several Pathans andSindhis from the North found it
difficult to accept the conditions requiring them to refrain from defending themselves in
case they were beaten; not only did they ac cept it, however, but, when the testing time
came, they actually made no move to defend themselves.
And so, the first batch started on its march.40On the very first night, we had the
experience of sleeping out on the grass. On the way, warrants were r eceived for the arrest
of about 150 persons and they surrendered themselves readily. A single police officer had
come to make the arrests. He had no assistant; how the arrested men were to be taken
away became a problem. We were only 6 miles from Charlesto wn. So I suggested to the
officer that these persons could proceed along with me and that he should take them into
custody at Charlestown, or do whatever he thought fit after obtaining instructions from
his superiors. The officer agreed and left us. We ar rived at Charlestown. This is a very
small township, with a population of barely 1,000. There is only one main road and the
Indian population is negligible. The whites were amazed, therefore, at the sight of our
party. At no time had so many Indians appear ed in Charlestown. There was no train ready
to convey the prisoners to Newcastle. Where could the police keep them? There was not
enough room for all these arrested persons at the Charlestown police station. And so, the
police handed them over to me and ag reed to pay for their food. This is no small tribute
tosatyagraha . In the ordinary course of things, how could people arrested from among us
be placed in our charge? If some of them had escaped, the responsibility would not have
been ours. But everyone k new that it was the job of the satyagrahis to court arrest and
they had, therefore, full confidence in us. The arrested men thus stayed with us for four
days more. When the police were ready to take charge of them, they went away willingly.
More and m ore people were being recruited to our party. On some days 400 would join,
on others even more. Many arrived on foot, while women came mostly by train. These
were put up wherever there was space in the houses of Indian merchants of Charlestown.
The local C orporation also offered us houses. The whites did not give us the slightest
trouble. On the contrary, they went out of their way to help us. One Dr. Briscoe41took it
upon himself to give us free medical aid and, when we proceeded beyond Charlestown,
he gave us gratis some expensive medicines and useful instruments. Our food was
cooked in the mosque premises. The fire had to remain lit all the twenty -four hours. The

41District Health Officer in Charlestowncooks came from among the strikers. During the final days, four to five thousand persons
were being fed. Yet these workers never lost heart. In the morning, the meal consisted of
mealie pap with sugar and some bread. In the evening they had rice, daland vegetables.
Most people in South Africa eat thrice a day. The indentured labourers always ha ve three
meals, but during the struggle they remained content with only two. They like to have
small delicacies with their meals, but these, too, they gave up at this time.
What to do with these huge crowds of people became a problem. If they were kep t
somehow in Charlestown, there was the likelihood of an epidemic breaking out.
Moreover, it was not desirable that so many thousands accustomed to hard work should
be kept in a state of idleness. It needs to be mentioned here that, although so many poor
people had come together in Charlestown, not one of them committed a theft. The police
had never to be called and they had no extra work on our account. However, it seemed
best not to keep waiting in Charlestown. It was therefore decided to proceed to the
Transvaal and, if not arrested, to go on ultimately to Tolstoy Farm. Before commencing
the march, the Government was informed that we were proceeding to the Transvaal to
court arrest, that we had no desire to stay there or to claim any rights, but that, so long as
the Government did not arrest us, we would continue our march and finally stay on
Tolstoy Farm. If, however, the Government promised to withdraw the £ 3 tax, we were
willing to return. But the Government was in no mood to consider this notice. It was
misled by its informants who assured it that the strikers would soon be exhausted. The
Government had a notice printed in all languages and distributed among the strikers.
At last the time came for us to proceed beyond Charlestown. On November 6, a party
of 3,000 left at day -break. The procession was more than a mile long. Mr. Kallenbach
and I were at the rear. The procession reached the border where a police party stood in
readiness. When the two of us reached the spot, we had a talk with the pol ice. They
refused to arrest us and the procession went on in a disciplined and peaceful manner
through Volksrust. On reaching Standerton Road outside the town, we halted and had
some refreshments. It had been arranged that women should not join in this mar ch, but
later it became impossible to check the tide of enthusiasm and a few women managed to
accompany the procession. However, some women and children still remained behind in
Charlestown. After crossing the border at Volksrust, Mr. Kallenbach was sent b ack to
look after them.
On the following day, the police arrested me near Palmford. I was charged with having
brought unauthorised persons into the Transvaal. There was no warrant for the arrest of
anyone else. Therefore, on reaching Volksrust, I sent the following telegram to the
Government:
"WHILST I APPRECIATE THE FACT OF GOVERNMENT HAVING AT
LAST ARRESTED PRIME MOVER IN PASSIVE RESISTANCE STRUGGLE,
CANNOT HELP REMARKING THAT FROM POINT VIEW HUMANITY
MOMENT CHOSEN MOST UNFORTUNATE. GOVERNMENT PROBA BLY
KNOW THAT MARCHERS INCLUDE 122 WOMEN, FIFTY TENDER
CHILDREN, ALL VOLUNTARILY MARCHING ON STARVATIONRATIONS WITHOUT PROVISION FOR SHELTER DURING STAGES.
TEARING ME AWAY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES FROM THEM IS
VIOLATION ALL CONSIDERATIONS JUSTICE. WHEN A RRESTED LAST
NIGHT LEFT MEN WITHOUT INFORMING THEM. THEY MIGHT
BECOME INFURIATED. I, THEREFORE, ASK EITHER THAT I MAY BE
ALLOWED CONTINUE MARCH WITH MEN OR THAT GOVERNMENT
SEND THEM BY RAIL TOLSTOY FARM AND PROVIDE FULL RATIONS
FOR THEM. LEAVING THEM WITHO UT ONE IN WHOM THEY HAVE
CONFIDENCE AND WITHOUT GOVERNMENT MAKING PROVISION
FOR THEM IS IN MY OPINION AN ACT FROM WHICH I HOPE ON
RECONSIDERATION GOVERNMENT WILL RECOIL. IF UNTOWARD
INCIDENTS HAPPEN DURING FURTHER PROGRESS MARCH OR IF
DEATHS OCCUR, ESPECIA LLY AMONG WOMEN WITH BABIES IN
ARMS, RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE GOVERNMENT’S."
The procession went ahead. I was produced before the magistrate at Volksrust. I did
not, of course, wish to defend myself. But as some arrangements had yet to be made
regarding those who had gone beyond Palmford and those left behind at Charlestown, I
asked for time. The Government pleader objected, but the magistrate pointed out that bail
could be refused only in a case of murder. He then asked me to furnish a bail of £ 50 and
gave me time for a week. The amount was immediately paid by a merchant in Volksrust.
As soon as I was released, I went straight to the marchers. Their enthusiasm was doubled.
Meanwhile, a wire came from Pretoria to say that the Government had no intention of
arresting the Indians who were with me. Only the leaders were to be arrested. This did
not mean that all the rest would be allowed to go free. But the Government had no desire
to make our work easy by arresting all of us or to provoke agitation in Indi a on this
account.
Mr. Kallenbach followed with another large batch. Our party of over 2,000 was
nearing Standerton. There, I was again arrested and the hearing was fixed for the 21st.
We, however, proceeded on our way. But now the Government could st and this no longer
and it took the step of separating me from the rest. At this time, preparations were afoot
to send Mr. Polak42to India with a deputation. He came to see me before leaving. But
"our undertakings remain unfinished, and the will of God pre vails". This is what
happened. On Sunday, I was arrested, for the third time, near Greylingstad. The warrant
this time was issued from Dundee and the charge was that of instigating the workers to
stop work. I was removed from there to Dundee in utmost secr ecy. I have mentioned
above that Mr. Polak was in the march with us. He now took charge. My case came up
for hearing in Dundee on Tuesday. All three charges against me were read out and I
pleaded guilty to all of them. I then made, with the Court’s permiss ion, the following
statement:
42H. S. L. Polak, an attorney and associate of Gandhiji. He was sent by Gandhiji
to India in 1909 -10 and to Britain in 1911 and 1913 to explain and promote
support for the cause of India ns in South Africa.Summary
As a member of the profession, and being an old resident of Natal, he
thought that, in justice to himself and the public, he should state that the counts
against him were of such a nature that he took the responsibility imposed upon
him, for he believed that the demonstration for which these people were taken out
of the Colony was one for a worthy object. He felt that he should say that he had
nothing against the employers, and regretted that in this campa ign, serious losses
were being caused to them. He appealed to the employers also, and he felt that the
tax was one which was heavily weighing down his countrymen, and should
removed. He also felt that he was in honour bound, in view of the position of
things between Mr. Smuts and Professor Gokhale, to produce a striking
demonstration.43He was aware of the miseries caused to the women and babes in
arms. On the whole, he felt he had not gone beyond the principles and honour of
the profession of which he was a member. He felt that he had only done his duty
in advising his countrymen, and it was his duty to advise them again, that until the
tax were removed, to leave work and subsist upon rations obtained by charity. He
was certain that without suffering it was not possible for them to get their
grievances remedied.
I made myself quite comfortable in gaol. Afterwards, proceedings were taken against
me in Volksrust and I was given another three months of gaol, besides the nine months I
got at Dundee.
About this time, I learnt that Mr. Polak had been arrested and that instead of going to
India he found himself in gaol. I, for one, was delighted, because this, to my mind, was a
far more weighty deputation than the other one. Soon after this, Mr. Kallenbach was
arrested and he also, like Mr. Polak, found himself lodged in gaol for three months. The
Government was sadly mistaken when it imagined that, once the leaders were arrested,
the people would surrender. All the strikers were put into four special trains and taken to
mines in Dundee and Newcastle. They were subjected to much cruelty and they suffered
terribly. But they had come forward to suffer. They were their own leaders. They had to
demonstrate their strength, left as they were without any leaders, so called; and they did
so. How well they did is known to all the world...

43Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a member of the Viceroy's Legislative Council and a
prominent public leader in India, met Prime Minister General Botha on November
14, 1912, to discuss the position of Indians in South Africa. General J. C. Smu ts
and Abraham Fischer, the responsible Ministers, were also present. Mr. Gokhale
understood that they undertook to repeal the £3 annual tax imposed by Natal on
former indentured labourers from India, who did not re -indenture themselves or
leave for India, as well as their wives and children. But the South African
Government subsequently denied an undertaking and took no action.Indian Opinion . Golden Number, December 1914; Collected Works , Volume 12, pages

3. THE REVEREND JOSEPH J. DOKE44
He who played an important part in the Indian Passive Resistance Movement did not
live to see the final stages. He has described the struggle in his own graphic style in his
monograph on me, Gandhi.
This chapter is intended to take a brief survey of the Movement from where Mr. Doke
left it . No Englishman had such a keen grasp of the subject as he, by patient study, had
acquired. Busy though he was with the work of his own flock, if a man of his breadth of
vision and his all -round humanity could be said to have had a special flock, he made t his
Indian Question as much his own as the work of the Pastorate. He collected and tabulated
every scrap of paper upon the subject. He wrote much upon it. He saw the authorities and
spoke to them with the certainty of the knowledge of an expert. He took ch arge of the
editorial work of the Passive Resistance organ, Indian Opinion ,45during Mr. Gandhi’s
and Mr. Polak's absence from South Africa. The leading articles he wrote for the journal
during the period are literally monuments. His anxiety to keep up the traditions of the
journal was so great that, in matters of policy, he took the advice of, and allowed himself
to be guided by, those whom he was not bound to consult. He came in contact with the
best and the worst of Indians. All his study was not merely t o bring to a close a
movement, however great it may have been. He had dreams about the future of South
Africa, the part that Indians were to play in it, the part that Christianity had to play in the
great drama that was being enacted before him. His Indian work was taken up in answer
to the question of his soul: "What am I to do in South Africa in the midst of many races?"
Mr. Doke had intended, if he had lived, to take part in the constructive programme of
the Indian community after the struggle was f inished. He had intended, too, to write a
volume on the lessons of the struggle. But that was not to be.
The readers of these pages will, however, be glad to know the final results of the
historical struggle which attracted world -wide attention. Only a bird’s -eye view is
possible in a single chapter of a book, when a full description would require several
44Gandhiji wrote this for William E. Cursons who was preparing a biography of
the Reverend Doke at the request of his family. It was published as Chapter XV of
the biography -Joseph Doke: The Missionary -Hearted (Johannesburg: The
Christian Literature Depot, 1929) -under the title: "The Asiatic Passive
Resistance Struggle -The Final Stages -by M.K. Gandhi". The date when
Gandh iji wrote this is not available; there was a delay of several years before the
publication of the biography.
45Indian Opinion , a weekly, was established by Gandhiji in June 1903 with M. H.
Nazar as editor.
The Reverend J. J. Doke was editor for a brief period in 1913.volumes. During the last stages it took a most unexpected and brilliant turn. Every act of
repression by the authorities only heartened the resister s. The refusal of the Government
to recognise the legal status of Indian minors and to abolish the poll -tax on indentured
Indians, which it was claimed on their behalf the Government had promised the late Mr.
Gokhale to do, brought thousands to the Passive Resistance fold. Indentured Indians,
working in the Natal mines and in the sugar fields, struck work and sought imprisonment.
This strike must be distinguished from ordinary strikes. It was undertaken, not to usurp
the functions of the Government or to pa ralyse the industries concerned. It was declared
simply as a protest against the £3 tax. It was an assertion on the part of the strikers, men
and women, of their self -respect. They were no longer content to pay a tax, which not
only told heavily upon their slender purses, but which was a mark of their degradation
and a cause of terror to the women -folk. At one time nearly 30,000 men were on strike.
The Government and the planters tried every means to bend the strikers, but without avail.
They had but one pu rpose in life: these strikers refused to be left alone. They wanted to
fill the prisons. After due notice to the Government, nearly 2,000 of them, men, women
and children, marched into the Transvaal. They had no legal right to cross the border,
their desti nation was Tolstoy Farm, established by Mr. Kallenbach for Passive Resisters,
the distance to be covered was 150 miles. No army ever marched with so little burden.
No wagons or mules accompanied the party. Each one carried his own blankets and daily
ration s, consisting of one pound of bread and one ounce of sugar. This meagre ration was
supplemented by what Indian merchants gave them on their way. The Government
imprisoned the leaders, i.e., those whom they thought were leaders. But they soon found
that all were leaders. So when they were nearly within reach of their destination the
whole party was arrested. Thus their object (to get arrested) was accomplished. That
extreme reasonableness was mixed with such an unbending spirit was shown when the
Indian stri kers voluntarily stayed their activity during the strike of the Government
railway men, which was certainly not a Passive Resistance Movement.
The Indian strikers at once stood aloof, and their self -restraint was much appreciated
throughout the Empire ; whilst it had not a little to do with the final settlement, for which
negotiations were opened.
It will be easily imagined that India would not remain supine when a mighty effort was
being made by her sons in this far -off Continent. Under the splend id leadership of the late
Honourable Mr. Gokhale, meetings of protest were held all over the country, and
thousands of pounds were collected to aid the Resisters. Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy, who
strongly protested in a public speech at Madras against what was transpiring in South
Africa, sent a Commission to investigate the cause of the upheaval. A local Commission
was appointed. Though for high political reasons, the Indian community as a whole
refused to give evidence before it, the Commissioners complete ly vindicated the Resisters
by declaring in favour of every one of the main contentions of the aggrieved Indians. And
so at last legislation was passed, repealing the poll -tax, restoring racial equality in law,
and recognising the status of Indian wives. T hus ended the great struggle in 1914, after
having lasted nearly eight years.
Mr. Doke, along with many, considered it to be a religious or ethical struggle. It wasnot undertaken in order to gain individual rights but to gain national dignity. The me thods
adopted were not those of brute force or violence, but those of self -sacrifice and suffering.
Repeal of obnoxious legislation was an embodiment of the vital principle that Indian
sentiment must not be flouted on Indian matters. It was an admission of the right of the
Indians to be consulted in everything affecting their status and intimate well -being. And it
was for such an achievement that Mr. Doke laboured during his life -time. Who knows
how important a part he would have played in the more difficul t work of reconstruction?
Certainly the Indian community misses the guiding hand.

4. LETTER TO J. B. PETIT, JUNE 16, 191546
Ahmedabad,
June 16, 1915
Dear Mr. Petit,
...Whilst the actual courting of imprisonment has ceased, the struggle itself has by no
means ended. In its last stages, nearly 25,000 Indians actively participated in it, that is,
one-sixth of the total Indian population in South Africa. The balance of the community
practically but with few exceptions supported the struggle whether by contributions in
cash or in kind or by holding meetings, etc. It began in the Transvaal with the passi ng of
the now famous Asiatic Registration Bill in the year 1906, but as year after year the
struggle rolled on with temporary settlements, it included many other things besides the
Asiatic Registration Act, and covered the whole of South Africa. At the tim e of the
settlement, the points of Passive Resistance were as follows:
(1)Repeal of the Asiatic Act.
(2)Removal of the racial or colour disqualification as to immigration from the Union
legislation.
(3) Removal of the legal disabilities of Indian wives.
(4) Removal of the annual poll tax of £ 3, which was payable by ex -indentured Indians,
their wives and grown -up children.
46This letter to Jehangir Bomanji Petit, Secretary of the South African Fund,
contained an accounting of the income and expenditure in connection with the
satyagraha in South Africa. It was printed and published on October 31, 1915,
with minor alterations. The alterations are incorporated in the extract reproduced
here.(5) Just administration of existing laws with due regard to vested rights.
All these points are covered by the settlement of the last year which I consider to be a
complete vindication of Passive Resistance and I venture to state that if more has not
been gained, more was not -and could not be -asked for as an item in Passive Resistance,
for a Passive Resister ha s to frame his minimum as well as his maximum and he dare not
ask for more nor can he be satisfied with less.
But I do not wish to be understood to mean that nothing further remains to be done in
South Africa, or that everything has been gained. We ha ve only fought for removal of
legal disabilities as to immigration but administratively we have taken note of existing
conditions and prejudices. We fought to keep the theory of the British Constitution intact
so that practice may some day approach the the ory as near as possible. There are still
certain laws in South Africa, for instance, the Law 3 of 1885, Trade Licence Laws of the
Cape and Natal which continue to cause worry. Administration of the Immigration Law is
not all it should be. For these, howeve r, Passive Resistance [was not] applied and is at
present inapplicable, its application being confined to grievances which are generally felt
in a community and are known to hurt its self -respect or conscience. Any of the
grievances referred to by me may a ny day advance to that stage. Till then only the
ordinary remedies of petition, etc., can be and are at present being adopted. Letters
received from South Africa show that difficulties are being experienced in some cases
acutely by our countrymen and if no t much has been heard of them in India just now, it is
because of the extraordinary self -restraint of our countrymen in South Africa during the
crisis that has overtaken the Empire.
The struggle has defined principles and removed disabilities which we re in the shape
of a national insult. The larger question of the treatment of British Indians who came
from outside can only be dealt with here. For the question of the local disabilities still
unredressed, your Committee will have to exercise a ceaseless watch and assist as
heretofore the efforts of our countrymen in South Africa.
I feel I ought to place on record my strong conviction, based upon close personal
observation extending over a period of twenty years, that the system of indentured
emigrati on is an evil which cannot be mended but can only be ended. No matter how
humane the employers may be, it does not lend itself to the moral well -being of the men
affected by it. I therefore feel that your Committee should lose no time in approaching the
Government of India with a view to securing entire abolition of the system for every part
of the Empire.
Before closing, I am bound to mention that the struggle would not have ended so soon
and even as satisfactorily as it did, but for the generous supp ort rendered by the
Motherland under the leadership of the great and saintly patriot whose death we all
mourn47and but for the very sympathetic and firm attitude taken by the noble man who at
47Gopal Krishna Gokhalepresent occupies the Viceregal chair.48
M. K. Gandhi
5. SPEECH AT THE THIRTIETH SESSION OF THE INDIAN
NATIONAL CONGRESS, BOMBAY, DECEMBER 28, 1915 49
Mr. President and friends,
The resolution that stands in my name reads as follows:
"The Congre ss regrets that the existing laws affecting Indians in South
Africa and Canada have not, in spite of the liberal and imperialistic declarations
of Colonial statesmen, been justly and equally administered and this
Congress trusts that the s elf-governing Colonies will extend to the Indian
emigrants equal rights with European emigrants and that the Imperial
Government will use all possible means to secure the rights which have been
hitherto unjustly withheld from them, thus causing widespre ad dissatisfaction and
discontent."
May I please appeal to the press to alter the "equally" to "equitably" because that was
the word given last night at the Subjects Committee meeting?
Friends, it is an irony of fate that, whilst this vast assemb ly will be regretting the
attitude, the hostile attitude that has been adopted by the self -governing Colonies, a
contingent of your countrymen formed in South Africa will be nearing the theatre of war
in order to help the sick and the wounded. I am in po ssession of facts in connection with
the contingent formed in South Africa, which shows that it is composed of the middle
classes which, according to the Times of India , are going to form the future self -
governing nation. These men are drawn from ex -indent ured Indians and their children;
they are drawn from the petty hawkers, the toilers and the traders -all these men compose
this great contingent. And yet the Colonies do not consider it necessary to alter their
attitude, nor do I see the logic in their al tering their policy. It is the fashion now -a-days to
consider that because we have taken our humble share in the war by not being disloyal to
the Government at the present juncture, we are entitled to rights which have been hitherto
withheld from us as if those rights were withheld because our loyalty was suspected. No,
my friends. If they have been withheld from us, the reasons are different and those
reasons will have to be altered. They are due, some of them, to undying prejudices; they
are due, some of them, to economic causes and these will have to be examined. The
prejudices will have to be borne down.
48Lord Hardinge
49 Gandhiji moved the resolution regarding India and the Colonies on
December 28, 1915.What are the hardships that our countrymen are labouring under in South Africa, in
Canada and in the other self -governing Colonies? In South Afric a, the settlement of 1914
secured what the passive resisters were fighting for and nothing more and they were
fighting for the restoration of legal equality in connection with emigration from British
India and certain other things. That legal equality has been restored, the other things
granted, but the domestic troubles still remain, and if it was not the custom unfortunately
inherited for the last thirty years that the language, the predominant language in the
assembly, should be English, our Madras frien ds will have taken good care to learn one
of the northern vernaculars and then there are men enough from South Africa who would
tell you in one of our own tongues the difficulties that we have to go through even now in
South Africa. They are in connection with the holding of landed property; they are in
connection with men who, having been once domiciled in South Africa, return to South
Africa; there are difficulties in connection with the admission of their children and in
connection with trade licences. T hese are, if I may call them so, bread -and-butter
difficulties. There are other difficulties which I shall not enumerate just now...
Then how are these difficulties to be met? I do not intend to go into details, but the
Congress proposes that this di fficulty can be met by an appeal to the sense of justice of
Colonial statesmen and by an appeal to the Imperial Government. I fear that the Congress
can only do this. Lord Hardinge, only a few months ago, made a fervent appeal to Indian
publicists and to Indian statesmen for helping him to come to an honourable solution
which will retain the dignity of India and at the same time not cause any trouble to the
self-governing Colonies. Lord Hardinge is still waiting for an answer. That answer is not
supplied b y the Congress nor can it be supplied by the Congress. It has to be supplied by
associations such as the Imperial Citizenship Association, the specialists, if I may call
them so. 50The Congress has given them the lead and it is for these associations to frame
the details in which they will have to examine the rival claims and offer to Lord Hardinge
a detailed solution, a solution which will satisfy the Colonial Governments as well as the
Indian people and will not take away anything whatsoever from the ju st demands that this
resolution makes. With these words, I have much pleasure in proposing this resolution.

6. GOKHALE AND THE SATYAGRAHA 51
50The Imperial Citizenship Association wa s formed in Bombay in 1915 to use
the balance from funds collected for the struggle in South Africa for the benefit of
overseas Indians.
51This article was written before February 4, 1916, and originally published in
Bhagini Samaj Patrika ....He who lives in the manner of a sadhu , whose desires are simple, who is the image
of truth, is full of humility, who represents the very essence of truth and has wholly
renounced his ego, such a one is a holy soul, whether he knows it or not. Such a one was
Mahatma Gokhale, as I could see from my twenty years` acquaintance with him.
In 1896, I discussed (with leaders) in India the question of indentured labour in Natal.
At that time, I knew the Indian leaders only by name. This was the first occasion when I
had contact with the leaders at Calcutta, Bombay, Poona and Madras. The late Gokhale
was then known as a follower of Ranade. 52He had already at this time dedicated his life
to the Ferguson College. I was a mere youth, with no experience. This bond which
developed between us on the occasion of our very first meeting in Poona never came to
exist between any other leader and me. Sure enough, all that I had heard about Mahatma
Gokhale was confirmed by my own experience; but especi ally the effect which the soft
expression of his lotus -like face had on me has still not vanished from my mind. I
instantly recognised him as dharma incarnate...
Thesatyagraha struggle made so profound an impression on his mind that, though his
health absolutely forbade it, he decided to pay a visit to South Africa. He went there in
1912. The Indians in South Africa gave him a right royal welcome. On the very next day
after his arrival in Cape Town, there was a meeting in the local Town Hall. The May or
was in the chair. Gokhale was in no condition to attend meetings and make speeches. But
he left intact all the countless and taxing engagements that had been fixed. Following this
decision, he attended the meeting in the Town Hall. At that very first ap pearance, he
conquered the hearts of the whites in Cape Town. Everyone felt that a great soul was
visiting South Africa. Mr. Merriman, 53a prominent leader in South Africa and a man of
character and liberal views, had this to say when they met: "Sir, a visi t by a person like
you brings a breath of fresh air into this land of ours."
As the late Mr. Gokhale's tour progressed, the first impression became stronger. At every
place the distinction between whites and Coloureds was forgotten for the moment. There
were meetings in all places like the one held at Cape Town. The whites and Indians sat in
the same rows at these meetings and, according equal honour to the late Mr. Gokhale,
earned similar honour for themselves. There was a dinner in his honour in Johanne sburg.
It was attended by nearly three hundred prominent whites. The Mayor was in the chair.
The whites in Johannesburg are not likely to be awed by anyone. If they have some
multi -millionaires among them, they have also men who know people’s worth. These
vied with one another in shaking hands with Mr. Gokhale. There was only one reason for
this. In his speeches, the audiences saw Gokhale's overflowing love for his motherland
52Justice Mahade v Govind Ranade (1842 -1901). Judge, social reformer, author
and one of the founders of the Indian National Congress.
53John Xavier Merriman (1841 -1926). Prime Minister of the Cape, 1908 -10,
later member of the Union House of Assembly. Chairman of "Fair Pla y to
Indians".and a sense of fairness at the same time. He wanted his country to be treated with the
fullest respect and honour but did not want that any other country should be humiliated. If
he was anxious to see all the rights of his countrymen preserved, he was equally anxious
to see that the rights of others were not jeopardised in the process. Because of this,
everyone felt a genuine sweetness in his utterances.
Mr. Gokhale believed that he delivered in Johannesburg his best speech in South
Africa. It lasted more than three -quarters of an hour but I never felt that anyone in the
audience w as bored. How did he make this speech? He started preparing for it six days in
advance. He acquainted himself with the history of the question, as much as was
necessary for his purpose, posted himself with the relevant figures and, sitting up late the
preceding night, got ready with his language. The result was as I have stated. He satisfied
both the whites and his own people.
I shall never forget while I live the pains he took to prepare himself for his meeting
with Generals Botha and Smuts in Pretori a, the capital of South Africa. On the day before
the interview, 54he closely examined Mr. Kallenbach and me. He got up at three o’clock
and woke us up. He had finished with the literature he had been supplied and now wanted
to cross -examine me, in order to make sure whether he was fully prepared. I told him
politely that he need not have exerted himself so much. that we would fight it out if we
obtained nothing then, but that we did not want him to be sacrificed for our sake. But
how would a man, who had ma de it a rule to throw himself heart and soul into everything
that he undertook, listen to my words? How shall I describe his manner of cross -
examining (me)? How shall I praise his thoroughness? Such pains could have only one
result. The Cabinet promised Mr . Gokhale that a Bill conceding the satyagrahis’
demands would be introduced in Parliament in the ensuing session and that the annual tax
of £ 3 on the indentured labourers would be repealed.
The promises were not kept at the time mentioned. Did Mr. G okhale hold his peace
thereafter? Not for a moment. I am sure his exertions in 1913 to secure the fulfilment of
the promises must have shortened his life by at least ten years. This is what his doctors
believe. It is difficult to give an idea of the labour he went through in that year in rousing
India and collecting funds. India was in an uproar about the issue of South Africa. The
power which brought this about was Mr. Gokhale's. Lord Hardinge made a speech in
Madras which will go down in history. 55This to o was owing to Gokhale. Those who
54Mr. Gokhale had a meeting with Prime Minister General Louis Botha on
November 14, 1912. Two other Ministers of the South African Government -
General J. C. Smuts, Minister of Finance, and Abraham Fischer, Minister of the
Interior -were al so present at the meeting.
55Replying to addresses of welcome by the Mahajan Sabha and Madras
Provincial Conference Committee at Madras on November 24, 1913, Lord
Hardinge said:
"Recently your compatriots in South Africa have taken matters into th eir own
hands by organising what is called passive resistance to laws which they considerwere the nearest to him bear witness that, worrying himself over the South African issue,
he became permanently bed -ridden. Even so, till the very last he refused to rest. He
would receive, at midnight, tele grams from Sou th Africa as long as letters. He attended to
them immediately and drafted a reply on the instant. A telegram would be sent to Lord
Hardinge the same moment and a statement for the press prepared. In attending to the
question, he delayed his meal and delaye d going to bed, ignored the difference between
day and night. Such single -minded and selfless devotion would be possible only to an
elevated soul...

7.INDENTUR ED LABOUR 56
The question of indentured labour is a seasonable subject for more reasons than one.
Messrs. Andrews and Pearson 57have just returned from Fiji after finishing their self -
imposed labours for the sake of India which they have learnt to love as they love their
motherland. Their report is about to be issued. Mr. Malaviya 58has given notice for leave
invidious and unjust -an opinion which we who watch their struggle from afar
cannot but share. They have violated as they intend to violate those laws with full
know ledge of the penalties involved and ready with all courage and patience to
endure those penalties. In all this they have the sympathy of India deep and
burning and not only of India but of all those who, like myself, without being
Indians themselves, have feelings of sympathy for the people of this country."
56Gandhiji -supported by the Reverend C. F. Andrews, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu and
H. S. L. Polak, as well as the Imperial Citizenship Association -devoted great
effort from 1916 to 1918 to the campaign to secure the total abolition of the
indentured labour system. While recruiting of labour for Natal had been stopped
in 1911, export of labour to Fiji and the West Indies had continued. Gandhiji
spoke at many meetings and wrote several articles on the subje ct. He was able to
arouse public opinion because of his intimate knowledge of the condition of
indentured labour in South Africa. (Please see Collected Works of Mahatma
Gandhi , Volume 13, pages 306, 338 -42, 347 -51, 354 -55, 512 -15;The Story of My
Experime nts with Truth , Part V, Chapter 11.
The Government suspended recruitment of indentured labour in 1917 and
prohibited it in 1918.
57The Reverend C. F. Andrews and W. W. Pearson. Earlier, in 1914, they had
visited South Africa at the request of Mr. Gok hale and helped promote the Smuts -
Gandhi settlement.
58In March 1916, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya moved a resolution in theto move a resolution in the Imperial (Legislative) Council which will, if adopted, commit
the Government to a repeal of the system of indentured la bour. Mr. Malaviya’s resolution
will be, it may be recalled, a continuation of the late Mr. Gokhale's work in 1912, when
in a speech full of fervour and weighted with facts and figures, he moved his resolution
demanding repeal of this form of labour. The d eceased statesman’s resolution was thrown
out only by the force of official majority. The moral victory lay with Mr. Gokkale. The
death -knell of the system was rung when that resolution was moved. The Government, as
it could not then abolish the system, ou tvoted Mr. Gokhale but did not fail to note that
they must hurry forward to do so at an early date. Mr. Malaviya’s proposed resolution
and the report of Messrs. Andrews and Pearson, which latter, it is known, is to suggest
total abolition of the system, wi ll enable Lord Hardinge fittingly to close his most
eventful viceroyalty removing this long -standing and acknowledged grievance.
These lines will be merely an attempt to give personal observations and to indulge in a
few reflections upon the question. For facts and figures, the readers and the public
workers must look up Mr. Gokhale's speech referred to above and Messrs. Andrews and
Pearson’s forthcoming report.
Indentured labour is admittedly a remnant of slavery. The late Sir William Wilson
Hunt er, when his attention was drawn to it in 1895, was the first to call it a state
"perilously near to slavery". Most legislation only partly reflects the public opinion of its
time. Legislation abolishing slavery was really a bit in advance of public opinio n, and
that was a big bit. And its effect, like that of all such legislation, was largely neutralised
by the dissatisfied slave -owner resorting to the dodge of indentured labour. The yoke, if it
fell from the Negro’s black neck, was transferred to the brow n neck of the Indian. In the
process of transfer, it had to be somewhat polished, it had to be lightened in weight and
even disguised. Nevertheless, in all its essentials, it retained its original quality. The
hideousness of the system was forcefully demon strated when the curse descended upon
South Africa in the shape of indentured labourers from China for working the gold mines.
It was no mere election cry that the late Sir Henry Campbell -Bannerman 59had taken up
when he made the British Isles from end to e nd ring with denunciation of the system. No
cost was counted as too great for ridding South Africa of the evil. The great multi -
millionaires of Johannesburg spared nothing to be enabled to hold on to the indentured
Chinaman. They asked for breathing time. The House of Commons remained unmoved.
Mine -owners had to shift for themselves. The interests of humanity overrode all other
considerations. The mines were threatened to be closed. The House did not care. The
millions promised to Mr. Chamberlain 60would no t be forthcoming. The House laughed.
Within six months of the passage of the measure for the abolition of Chinese indentured
labour, every Chinese labourer had been repatriated bag and baggage. The mines
survived the shock. They discovered other methods of life. And now be it said to the
credit of the mine -owners as well as of the Conservatives who opposed the measure, that
Imperial Legislative Council for the abolition of the indenture system.
59Prime Minister of Great Britain, 1905 -08
60Joseph Cham berlain (1836 -1914). British statesman; Secretary of State for the
Colonies, 1895 -1903.both these classes recognise that the abolition was a great deliverance.
Indian indentured labour is not less demoralising. It has persisted because its bitterness,
like that of a sugared pill, has been cleverly, though unconsciously, concealed. The one
great distinction between the two classes was that the Chinese were brought in without a
single woman with them, whereas every hundr ed Indian labourers must include forty
women among them. Had the Chinese remained, they would have sapped the very
foundations of society. The Indian labourers confine the evil to themselves. This may be
unimportant to non -Indians. But for us, the wonder is that we have allowed the sin to
continue so long. This business about the women is the weakest and the irremediable part
of the evil. It therefore needs a somewhat closer inspection. These women are not
necessarily wives. Men and women are huddled toget her during the voyage. The
marriage is a farce. A mere declaration by man and woman made upon landing before the
Protector of Immigrants that they are husband and wife constitutes a valid marriage.
Naturally enough, divorce is common. The rest must be left to the imagination of the
reader. This is certain -that the system does not add to the moral well -being of India.
And it is suggested that no amount of figures adduced to show that the labourer is far
richer at the end of his contract of labour than whe n he entered upon it can be allowed to
be any set -off against the moral degradation it involves.
There is another most powerful consideration to be urged against the continuance of
this system. The relations between Englishmen and Indians in India are not of the
happiest. The average Englishman considers himself to be superior to the average Indian
and the latter is generally content to be so considered. Such a state of things is
demoralising to both and a menace to the stability of the British Empire. There is no
reason why every Englishman should not learn to consider every Indian as his brother,
and why every Indian should not cease to think that he is born to fear every Englishman.
Be that as it may, this unnatural relationship is reflected in an ex aggerated form outside
India when the artificial state of indentured service under the white employer is set up.
Unless, therefore, the relation between the English and ourselves is put on a correct
footing in India, any transference of Indian labourers t o far-off lands, whether parts of
the Empire or otherwise, even under a free contract must harm both employer and
employed. I happen to have the privilege of knowing most humane employers of Indian
labourers in Natal. They were their men. But they do not, they cannot, give them more
than the most favoured treatment that their cattle receive. I use this language in no
uncharitable spirit. The humanest of employers cannot escape the limitations of his class.
He instinctively feels that the Indian labourer is inferior to him and can never be equal to
him. Surely no indentured Indian, no matter how clever and faithful he may be, has ever
inherited his master’s state. But I know English servants who have risen to their master’s
state even as Indian servants have risen to their Indian master’s state. It is not the
Englishman’s fault that the relationship with his Indian employees has not been
progressive. It is beyond the scope of these lines to distribute the blame, if there is any,
on either side, or to examine t he causes for the existence of such a state of things. I have
been obliged to advert to it to show that apart from all considerations the system of
indentured labour is demonstrably so degrading to us as a nation that it must be stopped
at any cost and tha t now.The Leader , February 25, 1916; Collected Works , Volume 13, pages 247 -250
8. THE SECRET OF SATYAGRAHA IN SOUTH AFRICA 61
In brief, the significance of satyagraha consists in the quest for a principle of life. We
did not say to anyone in s o many words that our fight was in pursuance of this quest. If
we had said so, the people there would only have laughed at us. We only made known
the secondary aim of our movement, which was that the Government there, thinking us
lowly and mean, was maki ng laws to oust us from the country, and that it was right for us
to defy these laws and show that we were brave. Suppose the Government passes a law
saying that Coloured persons shall wear yellow caps; in fact, a law of this kind was made
in Rome for the Jews. If the Government intended to treat us in a similar fashion and
made a law that appeared to humiliate us, it was for us to make it clear to the Government
that we would not obey such a law. If a child says to his father: "Please put on your
turban th e wrong side up for me," the father understands that the child wants to have a
laugh at his expense and at once obeys the command. But when someone else, with
uncharitable motives, says the same thing, he clearly answers, "Look, brother, so long as
my head is on my shoulders, you cannot humiliate me in this manner. You conquer my
head first and then make me wear my turban in any fashion you please." The Government
there in a similar way, thinking the Indians lowly, wanted to treat them as slaves and as
faras possible to prevent their coming into the country. And with this end in view, it
began inventing ever new laws, such as putting names of Indians in a separate register,
making them give finger -prints in the manner of thieves and bandits, forcing them to
live in particular areas, forbidding their movement beyond a specified boundary, making
rules for them to walk on particular foot -paths and board specified carriages in trains,
treating their wives as concubines if they could not produce marriage certi ficates, levying
on them an annual tax of forty -five rupees per capita , etc., etc. Often a disease manifests
itself in the body in various forms. The disease in this case, as has been explained, was
the evil purpose of the Government of South Africa and a ll the rules and regulations
mentioned above were the various forms that it took. We, therefore, had to prepare
ourselves to fight against these.
There are two ways of countering injustice. One way is to smash the head of the man
who perpetrates injus tice and to get your own head smashed in the process. All strong
people in the world adopt this course. Everywhere wars are fought and millions of people
are killed. The consequence is not the progress of a nation but its decline. Soldiers
61Speech in reply to a question during a post -prayer meeting at Satyagraha
Ashram near Kochrab, Ahmedabad, on July 27, 1916returning from t he front have become so bereft of reason that they indulge in various anti -
social activities. One does not have to go far for examples. In the Boer War, when the
British won a victory at Mafeking, the whole of England, and London in particular, went
so mad with joy that for days on end everyone did nothing but dance night and day! They
freely indulged in wickedness and rowdyism and did not leave a single bar with a drop of
liquor in it. The Times , commenting, said that no words could describe the way those few
days were spent, that all that could be said was that "the English nation went amafficking
(a-Mafeking)." Pride makes a victorious nation bad -tempered. It falls into luxurious
ways of living. Then for a time, it may be conceded, peace prevails. But a fter a short
while, it comes more and more to be realised that the seeds of war have not been
destroyed but have become a thousand times more nourished and mighty. No country has
ever become, or will ever become, happy through victory in war. A nation does not rise
that way, it only falls further. In fact, what comes to it is defeat, not victory. And if,
perchance, either our act or our pur pose was ill -conceived, it brings disaster to both
belligerents.
But through the other method of combating injust ice, we alone suffer the consequences
of our mistakes, and the other side is wholly spared. This other method is satyagraha .
One who resorts to it does not have to break another’s head; he may merely have his own
head broken. He has to be prepared to die h imself suffering all the pain. In opposing the
atrocious laws of the Government of South Africa, it was this method that we adopted.
We made it clear to the said Government that we would never bow to its outrageous laws.
No clapping is possible without tw o hands to do it, and no quarrel without two persons to
make it. Similarly, no State is possible without two entities (the rulers and the ruled). You
are our sovereign, our Government, only so long as we consider ourselves your subjects.
When we are not su bjects, you are not the sovereign either. So long as it is your
endeavour to control us with justice and love, we will let you do so. But if you wish to
strike at us from behind, we cannot permit it. Whatever you do in other matters, you will
have to ask o ur opinion about the laws that concern us. If you make laws to keep us
suppressed in a wrongful manner and without taking us into confidence, these laws will
merely adorn the statute -books. We will never obey them. Award us for it what
punishment you like, we will put up with it. Send us to prison and we will live there as in
a paradise. Ask us to mount the scaffold and we will do so laughing. Shower what
sufferings you like upon us, we will calmly endure all and not hurt a hair of your body.
We will gladly die and will not so much as touch you. But so long as there is yet life in
these our bones, we will never comply with your arbitrary laws.
It all began on a Sunday evening in Johannesburg when I sat on a hillock with another
gentleman called Hemchan dra. The memory of that day is so vivid that it might have
been yesterday. At my side lay a Government Gazette . It contained the several clauses of
the law concerning Indians. As I read it, I shook with rage. What did the Government
take us for? Then and t here I produced a translation of that portion of the Gazette which
contained the said laws and wrote under it: "I will never let these laws govern me." This
was at once sent for publication to Indian Opinion at Phoenix. I did not dream at the time
that ev en a single Indian would be capable of the unprecedented heroism the Indian
revealed or that the satyagraha movement would gain the momentum it did.Immediately, I made my view known to fellow -Indians and many of them declared
their readiness for satyagraha . In the first conflict, people took part under the impression
that our aim would be gained after only a few days of suffering. In the second conflict,
there were only a very few people to begin with but later many more came along.
Afterwards when, on the visit of Mr. Gokhale, the Government of South Africa pledged
itself to a settlement, the fight ceased. Later, the Government treacherously refused to
honour its pledge, and a third satyagraha battle became necessary. Gokhale at that time
asked me ho w many people I thought would take part in the satyagraha . I wrote saying
they would be between 30 and 60. But I could not find even that number. Only 16 of us
took up the challenge. We were firmly decided that so long as the Government did not
repeal its atrocious laws or make some settlement, we would accept every penalty but
would not submit. We had never hoped that we should find many fellow -fighters. But the
readiness of one person without self -interest to offer himself for the cause of truth and
coun try always has its effect. Soon there were twenty thousand people in the movement.
There was no room for them in the prisons, and the blood of India boiled. Many people
say that if Lord Hardinge had not intervened, a compromise would have been impossible.
But these people forget to ask themselves why it was that Lord Hardinge intervened. The
sufferings of the Canadian Indians were far greater than those of the South African
Indians. Why did he not use his good offices there? Where the spiritual might of
thousands of men and women has been mustered, where innumerable men and women
are eager to lay down their lives, what indeed is impossible? There was no other course
open for Lord Hardinge than to offer mediation and he only showed his wisdom in
adopting it. What transpired later is well known to you: the Government of South Africa
was compelled to come to terms with us. All of which goes to show that we can gain
everything without hurting anybody and through soul -force or satyagraha alone. He who
fights with arms has to depend on arms and on support from others. He has to turn from
the straight path and seek tortuous tracks. The course that a satyagrahi adopts in his fight
is straight and he need look to no one for help. He can, if necessary, fight by himself
alone. In that case, it is true, the outcome will be somewhat delayed. If I had not found as
many comrades in the South African fight as I did, all that would have happened is that
you would not have seen me here in your midst today. Perhaps all my life w ould have
had to be spent in the struggle there. But what of it? The gain that has been secured
would only have been a little late in coming. For the battle of satyagraha one only needs
to prepare oneself. We have to have strict self -control. If it is nece ssary for this
preparation to live in forests and caves, we should do so.
The time that may be taken up in this preparation should not be considered wasted.
Christ, before he went out to serve the world, spent forty days in the wilderness,
preparing himself for his mission. Buddha too spent many years in such preparation. Had
Christ and Buddha not undergone this preparation, they would not have been what they
were. Similarly, if we want to put this body in the service of truth and humanity, we must
first raise our soul by developing virtues like celibacy, non -violence and truth. Then
alone may we say that we are fit to render real service to the country.
In brief, the aim of the satyagraha struggle was to infuse manliness in cowards and todevel op the really human virtues, and its field was the passive resistance against the
Government of South Africa.

9. GOKHALE'S MISSION OF SERVICE
The Hon'ble Mr. Gokhale's work in connection with the issue of indenture reveals his
single -minded devotion better than his other activities do. His tour of South Africa and
the agitation he subsequently carried on in India give us a very good idea of his ability to
ident ify himself with the work on hand. It is because of this ability of his that I have often
said that one could see an underlying religious impulse in all his work.
Let us go over his work in South Africa in some detail. When he announced his
intention of paying a visit to South Africa, there was a commotion in the official circles
in India. What would happen if a man like Gokhale should be insulted in South Africa?
Should he not drop the idea? But there was no one who could muster courage to s uggest
this to him. While yet in England, Gokhale had a foretaste of what he might expect in
South Africa. He asked for a ticket but the officials of the Union Castle Company would
not oblige. The report reached India Office. The latter issued per emptory
instructions to Sir Owen Tudor, manager of the company, that Gokhale should be treated
with the respect due to his status. In the event, Gokhale was able to go on the ship like an
honoured guest. He told me, when describing the incident: "I was no t very particular
about respect to me as an individual, but the honour of my nation is dear to me as my
very life and, since I was going on this occasion in my public capacity, I felt that any
insult to me would be an insult to India, and hence I tried to secure for me facilities in
keeping with my status." The wiser for this incident, India Office had seen to it through
the Colonial Office that Gokhale should also be properly received in South Africa and the
Union Government had made advance arrangements f or the purpose. They kept a saloon
ready for him and also provided a cook to accompany him on his tour. An officer was
detailed to look after him. The Indian community, on its part, had made arrangements to
accord him more than royal honours. Gokhale accep ted the Union Government’s
hospitality only in Pretoria, capital of the Union. Everywhere else, he was the guest of the
Indian community. The moment he arrived in Cape Town, he took up a careful study of
the South African issue. Even the general informatio n on the subject with which he
arrived in Cape Town was of no mean order, but that was not enough to satisfy him.
During his four weeks’ stay in South Africa, he went so deep into the question of Indians
there, that everyone who met him was surprised by t he vastness of his knowledge. When
he was to meet Generals Botha and Smuts, so numerous were the notes he wanted to be
prepared that I wondered why he would take all that trouble. He was in indifferent healthall the time and needed the utmost care. Despit e this, he would keep awake working till
midnight, and get up again at four o’clock in the morning and ask for papers. In the result,
the meeting he had with Generals Botha and Smuts led ultimately to the satyagraha
campaign for the repeal of the £3 tax on the indentured labourers. This tax had been
imposed, since 1898, on the labourers whose indenture had expired and on their wives
and children. If any labourer did not wish to pay the tax, he was obliged under the law to
return to India. This reduced the I ndians who had been trapped into indenture, rather, into
slavery, to a miserable plight. A man who had given up everything and gone over to
South Africa with his entire family, what could he do on returning? Here he would have
nothing but starvation to fac e. How, on the other hand, could he remain in indenture for a
lifetime? When free men around him earned as much as £4 or 5 or 10 a month, how could
he be content with 14 or 15 shillings? If he wanted to remain free, he would have to pay,
assuming that he h ad one son and one daughter, £12 every year by way of tax, including
the tax on his wife. How could he pay this exorbitant tax? The Indian community had
been fighting against this tax from the very beginning. There had been repercussions in
India too. B ut the tax had yet to be repealed then. Along with many other things,
Gokhale was to demand repeal of this tax. He had been boiling over as if this tax on his
poor brethren were a tax on himself. He brought into play the entire strength of his spirit
when he met General Botha. So strong was the impression that his words created on
Generals Botha and Smuts that they yielded and gave him a promise to repeal the tax
during the ensuing session of the Parliament. Gokhale announced the news to me with
great joy. These two Ministers had given other promises as well. As we are, however,
considering only the question of indenture, I restrict myself here to this part of his
meeting with the Union Government. The Parliament commenced its sittings. Gokhale
had left Sout h Africa by then and the Indians there discovered that the £3 tax was not to
be repealed. To be sure, General Smuts had made a lukewarm effort to bring round the
Natal members; in my judgement, however, he had not done all that he should have. The
Indian c ommunity informed the Union Government that the latter had bound itself before
Gokhale to repeal the tax and that, therefore, if the tax was not repealed, it would be
included among the issues on which they had been offering satyagraha since 1906. At
the same time, Gokhale was informed telegraphically. He approved of this step. The
Union Government ignored the warning given by the Indian community. Everyone
knows what followed: 40,000 indentured Indians started satyagraha , went on strike and
endured hardshi ps past all bearing. Quite a few of them were killed. Ultimately, however,
the promise given to Gokhale was fulfilled and the tax was repealed. 62

Motihari,
December 15, 1917
When I left South Africa, I had fully intended to write to my Indian and English
friends there from time to time, but I found my lot in India to be different from what I had
expected it to be. I had hoped to be able to have comparative peace and leisure but I have
been irresistibly drawn into many activities. I hardly cope with them and local daily
correspondence. Half of my time is passed in the Indian trains. My South African friends
will, I hope, forgive me for my apparent neglect of them. Let me assure them that not a
day has passed when I have not thought of them and their kindness. South African
associations can never be eff aced from my memory.
You will not now be surprised when I tell you that it was only today that I learnt from
Indian Opinion to hand, about the disastrous floods. During my travels I rarely read
newspapers and I have time merely to glance at them whils t I am not travelling. I write
this to tender my sympathy to the sufferers. My imagination enables me to draw a true
picture of their sufferings. They make one think of God and His might and the utter
evanescence of this life. They ought to teach us ever t o seek His protection and never to
fail in the daily duty before us. In the divine account books only our actions are noted,
not what we have spoken. These and similar reflections fill my soul for the moment and I
wish to share them with the sufferers. The deep poverty that I experience in this country
deters me even from thinking of financial assistance to be sent for those who have been
rendered homeless. Even one pie in this country counts. I am, at this very moment, living
in the midst of thousands who have nothing but roasted pulse or grain -flour mixed with
water and salt. We, therefore, can only send the sufferers an assurance of our heart felt
grief.
I hope that a determined movement will be set on foot to render residence on flats
exposed to vis itations of death -dealing floods illegal. The poor will, if they can, inhabit
even such sites regardless of consequences. It is for the enlightened persons to make it
impossible for them to do so.
The issues of Indian Opinion that acquainted me with t he destruction caused by the
floods gave me also the sad news of Mr. Abdul Gani’s death. 64Please convey my
respectful condolences to the members of our friend’s family. Mr. Abdul Gani`s services
to the community can never be forgotten. His sobriety of judg ement and never -failing
courtesy would have done credit to anybody. His wise handling of public questions was a
demonstration of the fact that services to one’s country could be effectively rendered
without a knowledge of English or modern training. I note , too, that our people in South

64Abdul Gani, a prominent businessman, was Chairman of the British Indian
Association from 1903 to 1907.Africa are not yet free from difficulties about trade licences and leaving certificates. My
Indian experience has confirmed the opinion that there is no remedy like passive
resistance against such evils. The community has to exhaust milder remedies, but I hope
that it will not allow the sword of passive resistance to get rusty. It is our duty, whilst the
terrible war lasts, to be satisfied with petitions, etc., for the desired relief, but I think the
Government should know th at the community will not rest until the questions above
mentioned are satisfactorily solved. It is but right that I should also warn the community
against dangers from within. I hear from those who return from South Africa that we are
by no means free of those who are engaged in illicit traffic. We, who seek justice, must
be above suspicion, and I hope that our leaders will not rest till they have purged the
community of internal defects.

This Congress re -expresses its regret that the British Indians of South Africa still
labour under disabilities which materially affect their trade and render their
residence difficult, and unjustly and unduly restrict their movement to and in these parts
of the Empire, and hopes that the local authorities will realise their responsibility to the
Indians who have, in spite of dis abilities, taken their full share in the War by raising corps
and otherwise remove the disabilities complained of, and authorises the President to cable

Leaflet No. 7 of March 4, 1918
South Africa is a large British colony. The Europeans ha ve been settled there for
65This resolution was moved by Gandhiji.
66In 1918, Gandhiji guided a strike of workers in textile mills in Ahmedabad.
These leaflets were issued when the strike seemed to be flagging. He later went
on a fast to induce the workers to stick to their pledge, and ended it after three
days when the employers agreed to arbitration. A settlement w as reached after 21
days of strike.over four hundred years. They enjoy autonomy. Many European workers are employed
in the railways of that country. These workers felt that they did not receive just wages.
Instead of merely trying to get their wages increased, the y thought of capturing the
Government. That was unjust; it was Satanic justice. It increased the bitterness between
the Government and the labour, and the whole of South Africa was in the grip of fear.
Nobody felt secure. Ultimately, there was even open fi ghting between the parties and
some innocent persons were killed. The military took over control everywhere. Both
parties suffered heavily. Each desired to defeat the other. Neither cared for justice as such.
Each side magnified the other’s misdeeds. Neith er had regard for the feelings of the other.
While this was going on, our workers behaved justly. When the railway strike
was launched, a strike involving 20,000 Indian workers had already begun. We were
fighting the Government of that countr y for justice, pure and simple. The weapon our
workers employed was satyagraha . They did not wish to spite the Government, not did
they wish it ill. They had no desire to dislodge it. The European workers wanted to
exploit the strike of the Indians. Our wo rkers refused to be exploited. They said, "Ours is
asatyagraha struggle. We do not desire to harass the Government. We will, therefore,
suspend our struggle while you are fighting." Accordingly, they called off the strike. We
may call this true justice. Eventually, our workers succeeded and the Government, too,
got credit because it did justice by accepting our demands. Our workers obeyed sentiment
and did not seek to take advantage of the opponent’s embarrassment. The end of the
struggle saw better mutua l regard between the Government and the people and we came
to be treated with more respect. Thus, a struggle fought on the basis of true justice
benefits both sides. 67

with a crisis: the government declared martial law when there was violence, and
the strike was suppressed by violence.
In July 1913, Gand hiji agreed to a request by General Smuts to defer
discussions on the Indian question until the railway strike was resolved.
Correspondence continued after some days, and there was no agreement. Gandhiji
resumed the satyagraha in September 1913 and it dev eloped into a mass
resistance.
The Government appointed a commission on Indian grievances and, on its
recommendation, released Gandhiji on 18 December. Mass meetings of the Indian
community, addressed by Gandhiji in the next few days, decided against
testifying before the Commission unless at least one nominee of the Indian
community was appointed to it and all other satyagrahis released from prison. It
was agreed to resume the struggle in January if these demands were not met.
Gandhiji went to P retoria in January and had an interview with General Smuts.
Before the interview, he told the press that he had postponed the resumption of
the struggle since the passive resisters would not wish to embarrass the
government while the resumed railway strike was on.If we conduct our struggle on the same basis, with a sense of justice, if w e bear
no malice towards the employers and ask only for what is our right, not only shall
we win but there will also be increased goodwill between the workers and the employers.
Another thing to observe from this instance is that, i nsatyagraha , both the sides
need not be followers of truth. Even if one side alone follows it, satyagraha will finally
succeed. The party, moreover, which fights with bitterness will lose its bitterness when
this is not returned by the other side. If a m an violently swings his hand in the air, he only
strains it thereby. Similarly, bitterness is fed only by bitterness.
We may, therefore, rest assured that, if we fight on with firmness and courage,
we are bound to win in the end.
Tomorrow we shall consider some instances of satyagraha .
Leaflet No. 8, March 5, 1918
In this leaflet, we are not going to talk about satyagrahis who have won fame in
the world. It would be more profitable for us and inspire us with strength to know what
suffering common men like ourselves have found it possible to go through... Such a
satyagrahi was Harbat Singh. He was an old man of 75 years. He had gone to South
Africa on a five -year contract to work on an agricultural farm o n a monthly wage of
seven rupees. When the strike of 20,000 Indians, referred to in the last leaflet,
commenced, he also joined it. Some strikers were jailed, and Harbat Singh was among
them. His companions pleaded with him and said, "It is not for you to plunge into this sea
of suffering. Jail is not the place for you. No one can blame you if you do not join such a
struggle." Harbat Singh replied: "When all of you suffer so much for our honour, what
shall I do by remaining outside? What does it matter eve n if I die in jail?" And, verily,
Harbat Singh died in jail and won undying fame. Had he died outside, no one would have
noticed his death. But, as he died in jail, the Indian community asked for his dead body
and hundreds of Indians joined his funeral pr ocession.
Like Harbat Singh was the Transvaal businessman, Ahmed Mohamed Cachalia. 68By
the grace of God he is still alive, and lives in South Africa where he looks after the Indian
community and safeguards its honour. During the struggle in which Harb at Singh
sacrificed his life, Cachalia went to prison several times. He allowed his business to be
ruined and, though he now lives in poverty, is respected everywhere. He saved his honour,
though he had to pay heavily for it.
Just as an old l abourer and a middle -aged businessman of repute stood by their
word and suffered, so also did a girl of seventeen years. Her name was Valliamma.
68Please see Gandhiji’s obituary on the death of Mr. Cachalia in 1918, item 18
below.She also went to jail for the honour of the community during that same struggle. She had
been suffer ing from fever when she was imprisoned. In jail, the fever became worse.
The jailer advised her to leave the jail, but Valliamma refused and with an unflinching
mind completed her term of imprisonment. She died on the fourth or the fifth day after
her rel ease from jail.
Thesatyagraha of all the three was pure. All of them suffered hardships, went
to jail but kept their pledge...
Leaflet No. 9, March 6, 1918
Yesterday we discussed the examples of three satyagrahi s; they were not the
only satyagrahis in that struggle. Twenty thousand workers were out of work at a time,
and the trouble was not over within twelve days. The entire struggle lasted for seven
years and during that period hundreds of men lived under great suspense and anxiety and
stuck to their resolve. Twenty thousand workers lived homeless and without wages for
three months. Many sold whatever goods they had. They left their huts, sold their beds
and mattresses and cattle and marched forth. Hundreds of t hem marched twenty miles a
day for several days, even getting on only on 3/4 lb. of flour and an ounce of sugar. There
were Muslims as well as Hindus among them. One of them is the son of the
Muezzin of the Jumma Masjid of Bombay. His name is Imam Saheb Abdul Kadir
Bawazeer. He who had never suffered any hardship before endured the rigours of jail life,
labouring, during his terms of imprisonment, on cleaning roads, breaking stones, etc., and
for months lived on tasteless and simple food. At presen t he has not a pie with him. The
same is true of Dadamiya Kaji of Surat. Two seventeen -year-old youngsters from Madras,
Narayanswamy and Nagappan, suffered to the utmost and sacrificed their lives, but did
not give in. In this same struggle, we may note, w omen who had never done any manual
work before went round hawking and laboured as washerwomen in jails.
Remembering these examples, will any worker among us not be prepared to
suffer some inconvenience to keep his pledge?

Editors’ Note
The year 1919 saw Gandhiji plunge headlong into all -India politics. The World War I
restrictions on civil rights embodied in the "R owlatt Act" made Gandhiji launch mass
protest. In moves markedly reminiscent of his trans -communal initiatives in South Africa,
Gandhiji secured powerful Muslim support for his satyagraha. The Jallianwala Bagh
massacre of April 13, 1919, and the Khilafat Movement further cemented the
constructive solidarity. By 1920 -21, Gandhiji was not only a bridge between India's
principal communities but also India's foremost mass leader: a leader, however, whose
ability to organise civil disobedience was matched by an uncompromising adherence to
non-violence.
Throughout the intensifying struggle Gandhiji kept tuning into developments in his
erstwhile theatre of resistance. And his friends in South Africa kept him posted.
In June 1918, Gandhiji received a cable from Ahmad Mahomed Cachalia which spoke
of new railway regulations imposing a statutory colour bar in regard to the issue of tickets,
seating in trains, and removal of non -whites from compartments. Gandhiji was also told
of a decision of the Natal Supreme Court to the effect that subjects of "Native States"
were aliens and not British subjects and hence not entitled to its protection. Gandhiji was
stung by these reports into writing to The Bombay Chronicle and to Sir George Barnes,
member of the Vi ceroy's Executive Council, urging that if the Natal Supreme Court's
judgement regarding "Native subjects" was sound in law, the law should be altered and if
unsound, should be set aside by appeal to the Privy Council. (Items 13 -14).
Likewise, Gandhi ji came down heavily on an Imperial Council Resolution (August
1918) which spoke of the principle of reciprocity in future immigration. Under this
principle the Government of India could restrict immigration into India even as South
Africa restricted immi gration into South Africa of dependents of Indians settled there.
Describing the resolution as "an eyewash," Gandhiji said only Indians would be affected
under the reciprocity arrangement. The number of Indians wishing to go to South Africa
to join their families there could not be compared to the few whites who may wish to
enter India. "It is like a giant telling a dwarf that the latter is free to give blow for
blow...." (Item 16).
Two of his closest associates in South Africa -Shapurji Sorabji Ad ajania and Ahmad
Mahomed Cachalia -died in 1918. Gandhiji wrote moving tributes in letters to the Indian
press about these colleagues in the South African campaigns.The summer of 1919 witnessed unparalleled repression in India. The Punjab wrongs
had angered the whole country as did the betrayal by Britain of promises made to the
Indian Muslims concerning the Ottoman Empire and the holy places. Gandhiji's faith in
the British Empire -which he had supported because of its profession of equality fo r all
its subjects -was shaken. He was estranged from the Government of India which he felt
was hopelessly indifferent to the welfare of the people.
Gandhiji led the non -co-operation movement in which tens of thousands of people
courted imprisonment. But his insistence on non -violence came to be disregarded by
spontaneous protests turning violent in different parts of the country. He was anguished
and called off the satyagraha, speaking of the need to start movements only after careful
preparation. The period was, clearly, one of intensities, both inner and outer.
But all these preoccupations notwithstanding, South Africa continued to claim his time.
Hardly had the World War ended when an anti -Asiatic movement mushroomed in
South Africa, de termined to abolish the vested rights of the Indians, particularly the
traders, and force them to leave the country. Leaders of government and major political
parties, instead of resisting this movement, went along with it and even fanned anti -
Asiatic prej udice.
The first objective of the anti -Asiatic agitators, especially in the Transvaal, was to
freeze trading licences and make it impossible for Indians to acquire land or other fixed
property through mortgages and shareholdings in private companies , as they had been
able to do legally until then. They even misinterpreted a letter by Gandhiji in 1914 in
justification of such action.
The South African Parliament set up a Select Committee in May 1919 to look into this
matter and on its recommenda tion, the Government rushed the Asiatics (Land and
Trading) Act, 1919, through the Parliament to appease the anti -Asiatic lobby. This law
made it almost impossible for Indians to obtain new trading licences or to own property
through mortgages and privat e limited liability companies.
Leaders of the Indian community contemplated civil resistance. In July 1919, the
officers of the Transvaal British Indian Association and other leaders signed a covenant
pledging resistance. The first Union -wide confer ence of Indians was convened on
August 4, 1919, and it decided to resort to civil resistance unless full civic rights were
granted.
During this crisis, Gandhiji did all he could to publicise the situation, to promote public
agitation in India and to p ersuade the Indian Government to act. He endorsed the plans
for civil resistance in South Africa. "Never has a community been engaged," he wrote
inYoung India (December 17, 1919), "in an unequal fight such as our countrymen are in
South Africa." (Item 41).
There was one redeeming factor in this grim scenario that pleased Gandhiji. "It is amatter of great consolation," he told The Tribune , "that Mr. Andrews is on the spot."
(Item 45).
The British and Indian Governments managed to avert resista nce by giving hope of a
Commission in which Indian interests would be adequately represented. An Indian civil
servant, Sir Benjamin Robertson, was sent to South Africa. But the Asiatic Inquiry
Commission, appointed by the Union Government in February 1920, was a wholly one -
sided Commission designed to appease the anti -Asiatic lobby. It included no member
representing India or Indians. It reported on March 3, 1921, with a series of
recommendations detrimental to Indians.
This shocking report came at th e height of the non -co-operation movement in India.
Gandhiji wrote:
"... at the present moment, I must invite our countrymen in South Africa to
carry on their battle bravely and single -handed, and help us here in the best way
they can...
"Either (white) supremacy must go in its entirety, or those of us who recognise
the tubercular nature of the disease must perish in the attempt to combat it... The
Report of the Commission can only spur my non -co-operation spirit to further
effort." (Item 50)
The contents of this section record the sharp deterioration in the attitude of the South
African authorities towards the Indians domiciled there, within a few years after the
Gandhi -Smuts Agreement.
13. ANTI -INDIAN LEGISLATION IN SOUTH AFRICA 69
Sir,
I offer no apology for seeking the hospitality of your columns for the enclosed
extracts from Indian Opinion . They deal with the well -being of over two lakhs 70of
emigrants from India. Mr. Ahmed Mohamed Cachalia, the esteemed President of the
British Indian Association of Johannesburg, 71has sent from that place the following
69Letter to the Bombay Chronicle which published it under the caption, "Anti -Indian
Legislation in South Africa". The letter appears to ha ve been released generally to the
press.
70Alakh is one hundred thousand.
71Mr. Cachalia was President of the Transvaal British Indian Association from 1908 until his
death in 1918.cablegram regarding one of the matters referred to in the extracts:
"MASS MEETING, FIFTH, STRONGLY PROTESTED SECTION NINETEEN
RAILWAY REGULATIONS. RESOLVED CABLE S UPPORTERS INDIA.
REGULATIONS IMPOSE STATUTORY COLOUR BAR IN REGARD TO
ISSUE OF TICKETS, PLACING IN, AND REMOVING FROM
COMPARTMENTS, OCCUPATION OF PLACES ON STATION
PLATFORMS, EMPOWER MINOR OFFICIALS REMOVE WITHOUT
ASSIGNING REASON. PLEASE MAKE SUITABLE REP RESENTATION
APPROPRIATE QUARTERS. COMMUNITY UNANIMOUS ASSERT
RIGHTS UNLESS RELIEF SOUGHT GRANTED."
Mr. Cachalia was one of the staunchest workers during the passive resistance
campaign that raged for eight years in South Africa. During that campai gn, he reduced
himself to poverty, and accepted imprisonment for the sake of India’s honour. One can,
therefore, easily understand what is meant by the words "Community unanimous assert
rights unless relief sought granted." It is not a threat, it is the bu rning cry of distress felt
by a community whose self -respect has been injured.
It is evident that the white people of South Africa have not been visibly impressed by
the war which is claimed to be waged for the protection of the ryots 72or weaker or
minor nationalities. Their prejudice against colour is not restrained even by the fact that
local Indians have raised a volunteer bearer corps which is gallantly serving in East
Africa with the column that was taken to East Africa by General Smuts.
Theproblem is difficult -it is complex. Prejudices cannot be removed by legislation.
They will yield only to patient toil and education. But what of the Union Government? It
is feeding the prejudice by legalising it. Indians would have been content if the po pular
prejudice had been left to work itself out, care being taken to guard against violence on
either side. Indians of South Africa could not complain even against a boycott on the part
of the whites. It is there already. In social life, they are complet ely ostracised. They feel
the ostracism, but they silently bear it. But the situation alters when the Government steps
in and gives legal recognition to the anti -colour campaign. It is impossible for the Indian
settlers to submit to an insulting restraint upon their movements. They will not allow
booking clerks to decide as to whether they are becomingly dressed. They cannot allow a
platform inspector to restrict them to a reserved part of the platform. They will not, as if
they were ticket -of-leave men, pr oduce their certificates in order to secure railway tickets.
The pendency of the war cannot be used as an effective shield to cover fresh wrongs
and insults. The plucky custodians of India’s honour are doing their share in South Africa.
We are here bo und to help them. Meetings throughout India should inform the white
inhabitants of South Africa that India resents their treatment of her sons. They should call
upon the Government of India and the Imperial Government to secure effective
protection for our countrymen in South Africa. I hope that Englishmen in India will not
72Farmers and peasantsbe behind -hand in lending their valuable support to the movement to redress the wrong.
Mr. Cachalia's cable is silent on the grievance disclosed in the second batch of extracts. It
is not less serious. In its effect it is far more deadly. But the community is hoping to right
the wrong by an appeal to the highest legal tribunal in the Union. But really the question
is above that tribunal. Let me state it in a sentence. A reactionary Atto rney-General has
obtained a ruling from the Natal Supreme Court to the effect that subjects of "Native
States" are aliens and not British subjects and are, therefore, not entitled to its protection
so far as appeals under a particular section of the Immig rants` Restriction Act are
concerned. Thus, if the local court’s ruling is correct, thousands of Indians settled in
South Africa will be deprived of the security of residence in South Africa, for which they
fought for eight years and which they thought the y had won. At least a quarter of the
Indian settlers of South Africa are subjects of the Baroda and Kathiawad States. 73If any
law considers them as aliens, surely it has to be altered. It is an insult to the States and
their subjects to treat the latter as aliens.
Yours, etc.

14. LETTER TO SIR GEORGE BARNES, JUNE 2, 1918
Dear Sir George Barnes, 74
I believe matters affecting the status of emigrants to the Colonies fall under your
department. If so, I beg to invite your attention to the attached papers.
You will note from the papers that the Union Government is again succumbing to the
white prejudice against colour and that what is claimed to be a war for principles and for
the defence of weaker nationalities has produced but little impression upon the whites of
South Africa.
The problem, I know, is difficult. Prejudices canno t be removed by legislation. They
will yield only to patient toil and education. But what I fear is that the Union Government,
instead of holding the scales evenly between conflicting interests, is itself feeding this
race prejudice. If my view be correct, it is a question as to how far it can use the
protection of the Union Jack in its anti -Imperial course. Might not the Government of
India effectively move the Imperial Government to make an energetic protest against this
73This apparently refers only to free im migrants from Gujarat.
74Sir George Barnes, Member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council in charge of the Department
of Commerce and Industryindecent exhibition of pride and r ace prejudice?
I suppose you are aware that the small Indian colony in South Africa has rendered and
is still rendering, as is admitted by all, much useful service during the war. A bearer corps
has been serving in East Africa from the time that Gener al Smuts proceeded there.
The papers are divided into two parts. One part deals with the newly framed railway
regulations which speak for themselves. It is unthinkable that an Indian should have to
confine himself to a reserved portion of a station p latform, reserved carriage, a reserved
ticket -office, etc., etc., and even then depend for a first or second -class ticket on the
caprice of the booking clerk who is authorised to refuse to issue a ticket to an Indian if, in
his opinion, the latter is not b ecomingly dressed.
The second part shows how, by the ill -judged action of the Union Government, Indians,
born in Native States and domiciled in South Africa, have been deprived of valuable legal
rights. If the Supreme Court’s decision is sound, the la w is clearly bad and should be
altered. If it is unsound, the Union Government should have it set aside by supporting an
appeal to the local Privy Council. Thousands of Indians from the Baroda State have
settled in South Africa for years. The Government mu st have known when they resisted
the application of the aggrieved party that they ran the risk of endangering the just rights
of Indians who are, to all intents and purposes, British subjects.
I do hope that you will set the cable in motion and take the necessary steps to undo the
wrong referred to in the papers herewith presented.
Yours sincerely,
M. K. Gandhi

15. THE L ATE SORABJI SHAPURJI ADAJANIA 75
One of the best Indians has just passed away in Johannesburg in the person of Sorabji
Shapurji of Adajan, near Surat, at the age of thirty -five. And it is my mournful duty to
pay a humble tribute to a fellow -worker. Mr. Sorabji, though known to a select company
of friends, was unknown to the Indian public. His work lay in South Africa. He was a
prince among passive resisters. He joined their ranks when the struggle in South Africa
was at its highest and when it had trave lled beyond the confines of the Transvaal. When
he joined the struggle, I must confess, I had my doubts about his ability to go through it.
But he soon made his mark as a front -rank satyagrahi . Neither he nor I ever expected that
he would have to undergo a series of imprisonments amounting in all to over 18 months
with hard labour. But he went through it manfully and cheerfully. Mr. Sorabji was a small
75Letter to the press, July 27, 1918trader when he took to public life in South Africa. He had a high school education. But
such as it was, he made the most effective use of it in the Transvaal. During the struggle,
he showed a steadfastness of purpose, probity of character, coolness of temper, courage
in the midst of adverse circumstances, such as the best of us do not often show. There
were oc casions when the stoutest hearts might have broken -Sorabji never wavered.
After the struggle was closed, it was my intention to send to England someone from
among a band of young Indians who had proved themselves capable warriors. A
friend 76had off ered the needful funds. The choice, for a variety of reasons, fell upon Mr.
Sorabji. It was a question, whether having abandoned the life of a student for over eight
years, he could take to it again. He was, however, determined. His ambition was to
become a barrister and fit himself for fuller service. To England he went. He had come in
close touch with Mr. Gokhale when he was in South Africa. He came in closer touch in
London. And I knew that Mr. Gokhale had the highest opinion of Mr. Sorabji's worth. He
had invited him to become a member of his Society. The deceased took an active part in
all the leading movements among Indians in London. He was for some time Secretary of
the London Indian Society. He was the first to join the Indian Ambulance Corps that w as
formed in London at the inauguration of the war and served at Netley, nursing the sick
and the wounded. After being called to the Bar, he proceeded to South Africa, where he
intended to practise the profession and return to India after he had given a nu mber of
years to South Africa and found a substitute. But alas! fate has willed it otherwise and a
career full of promise had to come to an abrupt end. The deceased was only 35 when he
died.
In all I have said above, I have hardly described the man in Sorabji. He was faithful to
a degree. He was a true Parsi, because he was a true Indian. He knew no distinctions of
creed or caste. Love of India was a passion with him, her service an article of faith. He
was indeed a rare man. He leaves a young widow to mourn his death. I am sure there are
many friends of Sorabji to share her grief. 77

16. IMPERIAL CONFERENCE RESOLUTION
The Imperial Conference Resolution on the status of o ur countrymen emigrating to the
Colonies reads well on the surface but it is highly deceptive. We need not consider it a
great achievement that we can pass the same laws against the colonials that they may
pass against us. It is like a giant telling a dwar f that the latter is free to give blow for blow.
76Dr. Pranjivan Mehta, who met Gandhiji as a student in London in 1888, became a life -long
friend and rendered financial help to Gandhiji until his death in 1932.
77Please see also Satyagraha in South Africa , Chapter XXIX, on the role of Sorabjee Shapurji
Adajania in the struggle in South Africa.Who is to refuse permission and passports to the colonials desiring to enter India? But
Indians, no matter what their attainments are, are constantly being refused permission to
enter the Colonies even for t emporary periods. South Africa legislation of emigration was
purged of the racial taint by the passive resistance movement. But the administrative
principles still continue and will do so, so long as India remains both in name and
substance a dependency.
The agreement arrived at regarding those who are already domiciled practically re -
states the terms of the Settlement of 1914 78... I may perhaps add that the South African
Settlement provides for the protection of those who had plural wives before the
Settlement, especially if the latter had at any time entered South Africa. It may be the
proper thing in a predominantly Christian country to confine the legality to only one wife.
But it is necessary even for that country, in the interest of humanity and for the sake of
friendship for members of the same Imperial Federation to which they belong
administratively, to allow the admission of plural wives and their progeny.
The above agreement still evades the question of inequality of status in other matt ers.
Thus, the difficulty of obtaining licences throughout South Africa, the prohibition to hold
landed property in the Transvaal and the Free State, and virtual prohibition within the
Union itself of the entry of Indians into the Free State, the prohibiti on of Indian children
to enter the ordinary Government schools, deprivation of municipal franchise in the
Transvaal and the Free State, and practical deprivation of the Union franchise throughout
South Africa, barring perhaps the Cape. The resolutions of t he Imperial Conference
therefore are decidedly an eye -wash. There is no change of heart in the Colonies and
certainly no recognition of Imperial obligations regarding India...

17. INDI ANS AND THE TRANSVAAL: STATEMENT TO THE
PRESS, AUGUST 29, 1918
Mr. Ahmed Mahomed Cachalia, President of the British Indian Association, Transvaal,
cables me to invite the attention of those educated Indians who may desire to go to the
Transvaal, to th e fact that six such men can, for the needs of the local community in the
Transvaal, enter that Colony. If there be any such in the Presidency, they should apply to
the President, British Indian Association, Transvaal, P. O. Box No. 6522, Johannesburg,
stating their educational and other qualifications, age and place of residence, the
applications to reach the President on or before the 30th October, 1918.

78The Smuts -Gandhi agreement of June 30, 191418. THE LATE A. M. C ACHALIA 79
It is my mournful duty to bring to public notice another South African Indian whose
death has been just cabled to me. He bore the honoured name of Ahmed Mohamed
Cachalia. He was for a number of years President of the British Indian Associati on of the
Transvaal. It was during the passive resistance campaign that Mr. Cachalia suddenly leapt
to fame and acquired among the Indians of South Africa a prestige unequalled by any
other Indian. It was on the 31st day of July 1907, under the shadow of a tree in the holy
mosque of Pretoria, that Mr. Cachalia hurled defiance at the might of General Botha and
his Government. Mr. Hosken 80had brought a message from the General to be delivered
to the great mass meeting that was held in the mosque compound, to the effect that in
resisting the Transvaal Government, the Indians were breaking their heads against a
stone. Mr. Cachalia was one of the speakers. As I am dictating these few words of
humble tribute, his voice rings in my ears. He said: "In the name of Allah, I wish to state
that though my head may be severed from the trunk, I shall never obey the Asiatic
Registration Act. I consider it unmanly and dishonourable to subscribe to a law which
virtually reduces me to slavery." And he was among the very few w ho never flinched
through those long and weary eight years of untold sufferings. Mr. Cachalia was by no
means amongst the least of the sufferers. He felt that as a leader his sacrifice should be
striking, and that he should stop at nothing if thereby the h onour of this country might be
saved. He reduced himself to poverty. He said good -bye to all the comforts of life to
which he was used, and night and day worked for a cause he held sacred. Naturally he
acquired a wonderful hold over the Indian community th roughout South Africa and his
was a name to conjure with amongst them. As may be imagined, there were often
disputes among Mohamedans and Hindus and other sections of the community. Mr.
Cachalia held the scales even between the conflicting interests and ev eryone knew that
his decisions would be absolutely just and sound. Mr. Cachalia was practically illiterate,
He was a self -made man. But his common sense was of the rarest order. It always stood
him in good stead and he was able to command the confidence an d respect of many
Europeans who came in contact with him.
The loss is irreparable and it would be doubly felt by the community, coming as it does,
closely after Mr. Sorabji's death. May God Almighty give this noble soul the rest and
peace which, I am sure , he fully deserves. 81

SITUATION, FEBRUARY 25, 1919 82
Ahmedabad,
February 25, 1919
Sir,
The cable received by me from Mr. Asvat, Chairman of the Transvaal British Indian
Association, and given below, shows that a revival of satyagraha with all the attendant
sufferings is imminent in South Africa, unless the danger that threatens to overwhelm the
Indians of the Transvaal is averted by prompt and effective action by the Government of
India, and if necessary, by the public also. The situation warrants a repetition of Lord
Hardinge's action, and the immediate despatch to South Africa of a mission consisting of,
say, a distinguished civilian, and an equally distinguished Indian publicist. 83

ADVISE."the Gold Area of the Transvaal in the largest part of its population. Krugersdorp is an
important town near Johannesburg, and contains many Indian merchants, some of them
owning stock probably worth three lakhs of rupees. If no relief is provided, it means r uin
for the merchants and for those residing in the whole of the Gold Area. The goal of the
Union Government seems to be, as has been openly declared by several Union statesmen,
to reduce its Indian settlers to the position of hewers of wood and drawers o f water. It is
possible that the Court’s interpretation is correct. If so, the Act itself must be changed and
the Indian community must be saved, not merely because of their status as British
subjects, but also because of the Passive Resistance Settlement of 1914, which protects
vested or existing rights.
The judgement is a direct attack upon Indian liberty in pursuance of the policy referred
to by me. The Government want further to harass the community throughout the Union
by refusing facilities for c onservation of its present Indian population. They cannot
remain in it, if they may not receive occasional visitors, if, on the death of a propertied
man, his trusted relatives may not enter the Union in order to administer his affairs. I can
understand t he dominant community in South Africa not wishing to have an unlimited
influx of people alien to them in civilisation. But it is impossible to understand a policy
of ruthless extermination, side by side with a profession of loyalty to a common Empire.
Moreover, this refusal to issue temporary permits is a breach of the Settlement. It has
been all along understood that temporary permits would be granted, whenever the
necessity arose. Surely nobody could question it in the late Mr. Mahomed Essak's case
quote d by Mr. Asvat in his cablegram. The reference to the late Mr. Gokhale in this
connection is a libel on a sacred name. After the termination of the interview, 84Mr.
Gokhale came directly to the hotel where we were staying. I had the privilege of being
his secretary and he related to me the whole of the conversation between ministers and
himself and there was not a word about his having consented to the stoppage of
temporary permits under any circumstances whatsoever. He had no authority to enter into
any agr eement. He went only to learn and to plead. Your readers will recall that at the
historic meeting held in Bombay upon his return from South Africa, he declared publicly
that he had no authority to negotiate a settlement and that he had agreed to nothing. A s
representing the Indian community, I was party to the Settlement of 1914. If any such
agreement had been made, surely it would at least have formed part of the many
discussions between General Smuts and myself. It is worthy of note that General Smuts
isnot now in South Africa. If he was asked, I doubt not that he would repudiate Colonel
Shaw’s allegation.
The cablegram adds that there are many other harassments going on throughout the
Union. We are supposed to be on the eve of embarkation upon Refo rms that are to
eventuate in the near future in full Responsible Government. What answer has India to
give to Mr. Asvat's pathetic appeal? The hundred thousand Indians of the Union have a
right to look up to the Government of India and the people for the p rotection of their
elementary rights.

Minister of Finance, Defence and Mines, and Abraham Fischer, Minister of the Interior, in

20. LETTER TO THE PRESS ON SOUTH AFRICAN SITUATION,
JULY 3, 191985
Sir,
TheTimes of India has led the way in showing that in the midst of sharp
differences between us -the English and Indians -there are points of contact on
which we can act wit h unison. Such is the South African Indian question.
Notwithstanding our preoccupations, we may not -dare not -forget this big question.
Even whilst the Maharaja of Bikaner86was hoping and appealing to the
Dominions’ statesmen that the Indi an settlers in the Colonies would receive fair and
liberal treatment, a scheme was being hatched by the responsible officials of South Africa
to deprive the Indians of the Transvaal of vested rights in breach of the compact of 1914,
to which the Government of India was witness, if not party.87
The Bill, which is now being discussed in the press and which, according to the
latest papers received, has passed the committee stage of the Union House of Assembly
at the end of May last, virtually dep rives the Indians of the Transvaal from holding fixed
property even as shareholders of companies or as mortgagees, as they have hitherto
successfully and legally done. It further deprives them of the right of obtaining new trade
licences throughout the Tra nsvaal. This means that Indian settlers, if they are not
now efficiently protected, will be reduced to the status of menial servants, no matter what
their capacity might be. It was bad enough to restrict so as almost to prohibit fresh
immigration. It is intolerable to confiscate the economic and material rights of legally
admitted immigrants and their descendants.
The duty of Englishmen residing in India and Indians is, in my humble opinion,
clear. We can create such an emphatic publi c opinion that we can shame the Europeans of
South Africa into doing the right thing. We can also by our united protest strengthen the
hands of the Government of India in its endeavour, which it will make as trustee,
85This was also published in New India , July 4, 1919;
Young India , July 5, 1919; and The Hindu , July 7, 1919.
86The Maharaja of Bikaner represented India at the Imperial Conference of July 1918.
87Following white agitation against the acquisition of property in the Transvaal by Indians, through
mortgages and shareholding in private companies, the Union House of A ssembly set up a Select Committee
on May 1, 1919, to look into the matter. Considering its report and recommendations, the Government
introduced a Bill to make it almost impossible for Indians in the Transvaal to obtain new trading licences,
and to prohibi t them from owning land or other fixed property by taking mortgages or as shareholders in
private limited liability companies as they had been entitled to.effectively to protect the Union settle rs of the Transvaal from impending extinction.
Yours, etc.,

21. LETTE R TO SIR GEORGE BARNES, JULY 3, 1919
Bombay,
July 3, 1919
Dear Sir George Barnes,
You were good enough to write to me some months ago that you w ere inquiring
about the South African Indian situation. It has since gone from bad to worse... You will
gauge it from the enclosed cuttings. Briefly, the position, if the Bill referred to in the
enclosed becomes law, will be that Indians in the Transvaal w ill not be able to trade and
hold fixed property, as they have hitherto been legally able to. This is a manifest and
direct breach of the compact of 1914 to which the Government of India was witness, if
not party. And party or no party, can it for a moment tolerate legal confiscation of
economic and material, as distinguished from political, rights? It is one thing to stop or
restrict immigration, it is another to deprive legally admitted immigrants of the means of
honest and honourable livelihood. I know you will act, and that promptly. The Bill
might even have passed all stages. I trust you will put the cable in motion and inquire...
Yours sincerely,
M.K. Gandhi

22. SMUTS -GANDHI AGREEMENT
...I trust the readers of Young India will not grumble if they for the time being
find its pages filled with references to the position of our countrymen in South
Africa ...
This question of the status of our countrymen in South Africa is a matter of no
small importance. The measure of our capacity for self -government is the measure
of our ability to feel for the meanest of ourselves. The cause being just, the wrong being
clearly demonstrable, we have to be the readier to act when the cause is of the
helpless. It is the magnitude of the wrong, not the person, that should arrest attention.According to the above test, this question of the stat us of our countrymen in South
Africa is of more immediate importance than even the all -absorbing question of
Reforms.88This question cannot await solution till after the Reforms are granted. It must
be dealt with now or never. It is to be hoped th erefore that India will witness a revival of
the agitation that was started by the late Mr. Gokhale in 1913 and which culminated in
the settlement of 1914.
What, then, is the Smuts -Gandhi agreement? It is remarkable but it is true that
every a melioration in the status of the Transvaal Indians has been used afterwards often
successfully by their opponents to take away further rights from them. The Indian settlers
have therefore always been engaged in resisting encroachment on their liberty. Thei r
progress thus has been negative. The agreement is set forth in the two letters dated 30th
June 1914, the one addressed to me on General Smuts` behalf and the other being my
reply thereto.89There is another letter from me written to Mr. Gorges, the then Secretary
for the Interior, setting forth my interpretation of the term "vested rights."90Anyone may
see for himself that the reply of the 30th June was written in my representative capacity,
the letter of the 7th July in my private capacity showing what I thought of "vested rights"
in connection with the Gold Law and Township Amendment Act... I would not press for
the insertion of a definition of vested rights in the representative correspondence, because
I felt that any definition in the correspondence m ight result in restricting the future action
of my countrymen. Thus my letter could not be used for the curtailment of our rights. But
the definition given by me as a matter of fact does not in any way whatsoever curtail
existing rights. There was even in 1914 and prior to it an attempt being made to interpret
the two laws mentioned in my letter of the 7th July 1914 so as adversely to affect the
rights of the Indians residing in the Gold Area. I therefore contended that the terms of the
settlement required that no rights that were exercised by the Indians at the time of the
passing of the two laws could be taken away even though the legal interpretation thereof
went against our countrymen. In support of my contention, I used Mr. Jaup de Villiers’
own statem ent prepared for the Imperial Government. If, therefore, my letter be part of
the settlement, it could only protect Indians from statutory infringement of their liberty.
That letter could not be used, as it has been used, even by the Committee of the House of
Assembly for creating a legal restriction. Mr. Duncan’s independent interpretation of it
will bear repetition.
He did not regard the Smuts -Gandhi agreement as an agreement or an assertion
that no more Indian licences should be obtained af ter that date. The agreement was a
protective agreement, under which an undertaking was given that the law should be
administered with due respect to vested rights and that the Gold Law would not be put
into force against the Indian community.
88Constitutional reforms in India. The Montagu -Chelmsford Reforms were announced in 1918 and
promulg ated in 1919.
89Please see Appendix I.
90Please see Appendix II.
The letter written by Gandhiji to E. M. Gorges on July 7, 1914, defining "vested rights" to be protected,
was misinterpreted to justify restriction of Indian trading rights.Whatever the interpretation of my letter or the whole settlement, the only
question before India -the Government and the people -is: "Are Indians of the
Transvaal who have served the Empire as faithfully as any of the other inhabitant s of
South Africa to be deprived of the right to reside and trade freely and to hold fixed
property there in at least as they have done hitherto?" The Government of India and the
people can only answer it in one way. And I hope that before the week is out, India
will send a message of hope to her children who are battling against heavy odds.

23. LETTER TO H. S. L. POLAK, JULY 5, 1919
I have your confiden tial memorandum. I must confess that I do not like it. We
cannot accept merely formal legal equality with the full knowledge that
administratively trade licences will be taken away. We must take up an unbending and
unbendable attitude on the quest ion of trade and fixed property. The existing law and the
existing practice, and so far as the latter is in our favour, must be at least maintained and
where the present law adversely interferes with the existing practice, as for instance in
case of Dada91,the law must be altered to accord with the practice. I am moving here in
that direction.
You will see from the columns of Young India what is being done. Mr. Sheppard
of The Times of India has responded satisfactorily in the matter.

24. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING IN BOMBAY, JULY 13, 191992
The problem which has brought us together today is a very important one and
calls for an urgent solution. If we do not come forward to share the suffering of Indians,
wherever they may be, it can be said that we are not fit to be an independent nation. The
hardships of Indians in South Africa can be imagined only by those who have had to
suffer them. It was many years ago that Indians started going to South Africa. In
those days the way lay through Mauritius. Forty years ago, Indians in good numbers
started going there under contract as indentured labourers. On the expiry of their contract,
they lived as free citizens. Many Indians, especially our Me mon brethren, went there as
traders to supply the needs of these indentured Indians.
91Dada Osma n, secretary of the Natal Indian Congress for several years, had a licence to trade in Vryheid
when the town was in the Transvaal under the Boer regime. In 1905, after it was annexed to the Natal, the
Licensing Board refused to renew his licence unless he moved to a location in the outskirts of the town. He
petitioned Lord Elgin, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but in vain. ( Indian Opinion , April 14, 1906).
92At a meeting under the auspices of the Home Rule League, with Faiz B. Tyabji in the chai rWhen gold was discovered in the Transvaal, a large number of Englishmen from
surrounding areas descended on it and succeeded, too, in making their fortunes. Indians
also earned, some more, some less. Following this, a few people suggested to President
Kruger that Indians should be expelled from the Transvaal. He could not do this at the
time, but later in 1885 a law was passed as a result of which our Indian brethren there
were put to much hardship. This law contained two important provisions, one which
prohibited Indian settlers in the Transvaal from holding immovable property and another
which required an Indian to pay £3 for taking out a trading licence. On e more law was
passed later which is known as the Gold Act. This also interfered with the enjoyment of
their rights by Indians.
An agreement was arrived at in 1914, which however did not remove all the
hardships of Indians. The anti -Indian l aws which the Government had recently passed
were repealed. One of them was the Registration Act93against which the satyagraha
campaign had been directed. This agreement between Mr. Smuts and me contained a
provision to the effect that the existing rights of Indians would not be disturbed. This
provision is being interpreted by Indians in one sense and by the Transvaal authorities in
another.
In 1913, when I had got Indians ready to march into the Transvaal, Lord Hardinge,
the then Viceroy of India, sent Mr. Benjamin Robertson to South Africa. At that time,
even here everyone felt that this would bring the desired results. Then followed
correspondence between Mr. Smuts and me which brought about some understanding.
Moreover, some Englishmen had also suggested that Indians should be refused licences
in the "Gold Area." No one has succeeded so far in securing the repeal of the Act of 1885,
which bears on the Indians` right of ownership of immovable property. But, in my
capacity as a lawyer, I used to ad vise people that we were entitled to the use of lands
mortgaged to us. In this way, many of our Indian brethren came to hold lands. Besides,
two or more people forming a company could acquire land. Because of this freedom, our
Indian brethren have been ho lding lands there by forming corporations.
But now they have been depriving us of these rights too. I admit of course that
there was a provision to the effect that, without prejudice to their rights to the lands
and immovable propert ies already held by them, Indians would not in future be able to
own lands, even in the name of companies. What is happening, however, is altogether
unjust.
A law has been passed as a result of which, after May 31, no Indian will be able
to carry on trade. In this way, they are being deprived of trade rights which they have
been enjoying for many years. As Indians, it is our duty to raise a united voice and call
the attention of the Government of India to this intolerable situation. O ur fight is not
against the Indian Government; we have only to strengthen its hands. It does not stand to
lose anything by our doing so. If at all the Imperial Government has been helping
the South African Government in this matter, our raising a strong protest here will oblige
it as well to take our side. The South African Government accepted my contention
93Asiatic Registration Act, enacted by the Transvaal government in 1907that there should be no racial discrimination in the Immigration Act. But today we find
that the white population there has come forward to deprive people of their rights.
Unfortunately, the three able men who worked indefatigably for Indians in South
Africa are no more. One of them was Mr. Sorabji Shapurji Adajania. As fate would have
it, he has passed away.94Another was Mr. Ahmad Mohamed Cachalia. He has also
passed away.95The third was Mr. Polak96who has left South Africa and has settled in
London. There is still one person there, but he has to attend to this matter in addition to
his own work.
Inshort, I shall merely say that when we find Indians in South Africa being
unjustly deprived of their rights, we should help them. I hope you will pass these
resolutions with acclaim.
"(1) That this public meeting of the Bombay citizens r espectfully protests
against the Asiatic Land and Trading Amendment Bill reported passed by the
Parliament of the Union of South Africa as it contravenes the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement
of 1914 and violates the elementary rights of the British Indi ans lawfully resident in the
Transvaal and, therefore, calls upon the Government of India and the Imperial
Government to intervene so as to secure the repeal or the veto of the said Bill.
"(2) That this meeting tenders its heartfelt sympa thy and assurance of support
to their Indian fellow -citizens in the Transvaal who are heroically struggling
against the unjust and unwarrantable encroachments made by the said Bill upon their
rights as citizens of the Empire."

25. LETTER TO SIR GEORGE BARNES ON TRANSVAAL ASIATIC
LAW, JULY 26, 191997
Bombay
July 26, 1919
Dear Sir George Barnes,
I thank you for your full letter98of the 18th instant regarding the recently enacted
94Please see obituary, item 15.
95Please see obituary, item 18.
96H. S. L. Polak, a close colleague of Gandhiji in South Africa
97Asiatic (Land and Trading) Amendment Act, No. 37 of 1919
98This letter reviewed at length the position in South Africa and regretted that protests from the Indian
Government had been unavailing. It also gave assurance that the Government would consider further actionTransvaal Asiatic Law.
In view of the last sentence of your letter,99I am publishing it together with my
reply.100I am deeply grateful that H.E. the Viceroy and you have been moving in the
matter. I am, however, sorry to have to observe that the information placed at your
disposal as to the true nature of the Bill is incomplete, if not misleading, and so is th e
information regarding the judgement of the Transvaal Supreme Court referred to in your
letter.
Here is the true position regarding the Supreme Court judgement. Sections 130
and 131 of the Transvaal Precious and Base Metals Act, 1908, merel y refer to residential
rights. They have no reference to trade rights which another judgement of the same
Supreme Court has held to be inviolable so far as the existing Transvaal laws are
concerned. You will, therefore, see that the new law deprives the In dian settler in the
Transvaal of his existing trading right. Sections 130 and 131 of the Law of 1908
attempted to curtail residential rights; the new law superadds the curtailment of trade
rights and thus completes the virtual ruin of Indians lawfully resi dent within the Gold
Area of the Transvaal. How can the Union Government with any cogency claim to have
scrupulously observed the compact of 1914? Let me add that the law of 1908 has always
been a bone of contention between the Transvaal Government and the Indian community,
and it was, I am thankful to say, because of the strenuous fight that the Imperial
Government put up in our behalf that the provisions of Sections 130 and 131 remained
practically nugatory. You will perhaps now see what is meant by the p romise, in General
Smuts’ letter to me, "to see that they (the existing laws) are administered in a just manner
and with due regard to vested rights." The vested rights regarding residence were the
rights which were exercised and enjoyed by the Indians eve n before 1908, viz., the right
of holding fixed property under leases throughout the Transvaal. Let me recall a bit of old
history. Law 3 of 1885 itself had become a matter of protracted correspondence between
the South African Republic and His Majesty’s G overnment through the British Agent at
Pretoria. The matter was then referred to the arbitration of the then Chief Justice of the
Orange Free State.101He declared all legislation apart from Law 3 of 1885 as amended in
1886 to be contrary to the London Conve ntion. All laws, therefore, passed after the award
in further restrictions of the liberty of British Indian settlers of the Transvaal were
to be taken when the full text of the ne w statute was received.
99"Of course, you are welcome to make any use you may think fit of this letter".
100Published in Bombay Chronicle andNew India , both of July 29, 1919
101The British Government protested to the South African Republic (Transvaal) agai nst Law 3 of 1885
which restricted Indians to locations, on the grounds that it contravened the London Convention of 1884
between the two Governments. Britain agreed subsequently not to raise objection when a slightly amended
law was promulgated in 1887.
There was a further dispute in 1893 when the legislature of the Transvaal passed a resolution asking the
Government to apply strictly the prohibition of Indian residence as well as trade outside the designated
locations.
The two Governments event ually agreed to refer the matter to arbitration by the Chief Justice of the
Orange Free State, Melius de Villiers. He held that Law 3 of 1885 was valid but that its interpretation must
be by tribunals in the country. The 1893 resolution was, therefore, de clared invalid.contrary to it and it was, I expect, for that reason, apart from the equity of the case, that
Mr. Harcourt102declared on 27th June, 1911, from his place in the House of Commons:
"Complaints against that legislation (the Gold Law and Township
Amendment Act) have been made and are now being investigated by the
Government of the Union of South Africa, who h ave lately stated that there is no
intention of interfering with any business or right to carry on business
acquired and exercised by Indians prior to the date of legislation."
Similarly, in 1912, Mr. De Villiers, the then Attorney -General of the Transvaal,
said: "No right or privilege which a Coloured person has at the present time is taken away
by the new Act." Indians had a right to rely upon Mr. Harcourt’s assurance and Mr. De
Villiers’ interpretation of the Act in question, and i f the Transvaal judgement has gone
against us, it is the duty of the Union Government not merely in virtue of the compact of
1914, but also of the assurance and the interpretation above referred to, now to amend the
law of 1908 and not to put a further res triction upon Indian liberty as the new law does.
I know you are overworked. My only fear is that as you have to act upon briefs
prepared for you, and as a powerful Government like the Union Government can far
more easily gain your ear than a handful of British Indians of South Africa, their
case may suffer simply for want of information. Do you know that the Indians of South
Africa raised an Ambulance Corps which served under General Smuts in East Africa?103
Is the new law to be their reward? I ought not to have to bring in the war services in order
to secure the protection of an elementary right which considerations alike of honour and
justice entitle them to. I commend to your attention the Report of the Select Committee
of the Union House of Assembly. I will gladly lend you a copy, if you do not have one
yourself.
Regarding fixed property, I see you have not got full information. I know you
will share my sorrow that the Union Government, unmindful of their trust and
equally unmindful of the written word, accepted the amendment
"prohibiting the holding of mortgages by Asiatics on property, except as security for
abona fide loan for investment and providing that any Asiatic company which
acquired fixed property after the 1st instant should dispose of the same within two
years or a further period as fixed by a competent Court, with a rider that in the event
of failure to do so, the property might be sold by order of the court."
I am quoting from Reuter cable, dat ed the 23rd May, from Cape Town. You will see that
this completes legalised confiscation of property rights throughout the Transvaal and
virtually the trade rights within the Gold Area of Indian settlers. There was no evasion of
Law 3 of 1885. The Indians did openly what the law permitted them to do, and they
should be left free to do so.
102L. Harcourt, Secretary of State for the Colonies
103The Indian community contributed two companies of stretcher -bearers during the War.I do not wish to prolong this tale of agony. The Government of India are bound to
protect the rights of the 5,000 Indian settlers of the Transvaal at any cost.
Here is my solution. Law 3 of 1885 authorises the Government to appoint wards and
streets in which Indians can hold fixed property. In virtue of this authority, they can
declare streets and wards of Gold Area township for Asiatic residence and ownership,
and they can instruct receivers of revenue to issue trade licences in respect of such streets
and wards to lawful Indian applicants. This will be pending the Commission promised by
the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Malan. The Government of India can see (by se nding a
strong representative) that the Commission does not prove as abortive as the Select
Committee of the House of Assembly. The Dominions may have the right to regulate
immigration. But as part of a professedly civilised Europe, they cannot restrict or take
away the trading and property rights of lawfully resident settlers. The proposed
Commission should result in the abolition of all racial restrictions upon such settlers.

26. SPEE CH AT PUBLIC MEETING IN POONA, AUGUST 3, 1919104
Mr. Gandhi got up amidst loud cheers and moved the following resolution:
"This public meeting of the citizens of Poona, held under the auspices
of the Deccan Sabha, hereby places on record its deep sympathy with the British
Indian settlers in South Africa struggling for the elementary rights of citizenship,
congratulates them on the brave and sustained struggle carried on by them, and
assures them of hearty support from the motherland . This meeting further desires
to thank the Government of India for their advocacy of the Indians’ case and
trusts that the Government of India and the Imperial Government will not rest
satisfied until full justice has been done to the British Indian settlers in South
Africa by the withdrawal of the Act recently passed and by the restoration of full
rights of residence, trade and ownership."
Mr. Gandhi, speaking in Hindi, told the audience that it was impossible for them to
have an a dequate idea as to how severely the recently passed iniquitous measure had
affected the interests of the Indians in South Africa. It was a subject worthy of their
serious consideration and it was their duty to help their suffering countrymen in every
way.
Mr. Gandhi said he had a telegram from Bombay informing him of Sir George
Barnes’ letter to him wherein the latter promised that the Government of India would
give careful consideration to all that Mr. Gandhi had to say and that they were already
communicating with the Secretary of State in the matter. He said he was grateful to the

property and trading rights of Indians in the Transvaal. Rao Bahadur Khopkar, retired Deputy Collector and
Vice -President of Deccan Sabha, presided.Government of India for their sympathetic attitude.
The new law, Mr. Gandhi declared, robbed the Indians of their elementary rights such
as those of being domiciled citizens of South Africa trading as others did, holding landed
property, etc. He recalled a Poona meeting held in 1896 under the chairmanship of Dr. Sir
Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, to protest against a similarly iniquitous enactment.105Dr.
Bhandarkar on t hat occasion said that he never took part in politics, nor did he ever desire
to do so, but as he was assured that the Indians in the Transvaal were suffering intolerable
wrong, he had decided to preside at the meeting with the greatest pleasure. Poona, th e
speaker reminded the audience, was a great centre of political, social and educational
movement and its contribution therefore in the agitation in question should be very
substantial.
Mr. Gandhi then referred to the encomiums paid to India for her sacrifices in war by
Gen. Smuts, on leaving for South Africa, and said that Gen. Smuts recommended in
effect that India should be accorded a treatment of equality, and still it was the Union
Government, of which he was a member, that was passing the obnoxi ous legislation.
The Indians in South Africa were not, Mr. Gandhi emphasised, asking for political
rights from the Union Government, nor were they demanding the right to sit in the South
African Parliament. There was, again, no fear of unrestricted immigration into the
country. It was a thousand pities that the Transvaalers grudged the Indians even the
simple rights to reside and trade, or the right to purchase land with money out of their
own pockets. Did it become them to deprive Indians of their b are elementary rights or
snatching from the Indians` mouths their scanty morsel? Mr. Gandhi told the audience
that the Indians there had now resolved to reply by asking for full civil rights and to
resort to civil resistance until those rights were granted .106
The Transvaalers sought by their new legislation to rob the Indians of rights of trading
in the Gold Area that were especially given them by a Supreme Court decision. They
maintained that the new legislation did recognise vested rights and even at tributed to the
speaker his having tacitly given his consent to the legislation. It was, said Mr. Gandhi, a
downright lie. But they did not rest satisfied with that legislation. Some of them, said Mr.
Gandhi, were then striving for excluding the Indians al together, by asking them to restrict
their trade and business to their own locations -which the speaker likened to
Mahanwadas andBhangiwadas107in Indian village -i.e., by asking them to trade among
themselves.

were compelled to resideIn conclusion Mr. Gandhi said that th e time had come for Indians in South Africa to
resort to the civil resistance that they resorted to some years ago, and which was
approved and blessed by the late Mr. Gokhale.108While the Indians there were on the
threshold of such a crisis, it behoved them here to understand the question thoroughly. It
behoved the Maharashtra people, more than others, as they were noted for their learning
and studiousness, to give their serious study to the situation in South Africa and to strive
by body, speech and mind to bring about a solution of the question.
The resolution was supported by Prof. Kale, Mr. Bhopatkar and Mr. Deodhar and
unanimously carried.

27. LETTER TO THE PRESS, AUGUST 13, 1919109
I have just received the following cablegram from Mr. Ebrahim Ismail Asvat,
Chairman of the British Indian Association, Johannesburg:

The words in parenthesis have been added by me to make the meaning clear. The
108The reference is t o the passive resistance campaign of 1913 -14.
109This was published also in the Bombay Chronicle , August 14, 1919, and Indian Review , Madras, August
1919.
110In July 1919, a number of Indian leaders in the Transvaal signed a covenant pledging civil resistanc e.
The signatories included the officers of the Transvaal British Indian Association: E. I. Asvat, Chairman; N.
A. Cama, Vice -Chairman; P.K. Naidu and B. K. Patel, Joint Secretaries.
A Union -wide Conference of Indians resolved on August 4, 1919, to a sk for full civil rights and to resort
to civil resistance until those rights were granted.cablegram bears out what I have said in my letter to Sir George Barnes and what I said at
the recent meeting at Poona. The restrictions are clear: (1) no further holding of landed
property in the Transvaal; (2) no new trade licences within the area affected by the Gold
Law and the Townships Act; (3) the present holders and their successors in title to
be restricted as to trade to the townships in which they are now trading.
As I have already remarked, this means virtual ruin of the Indian settlers in the Transva al.
The only means of livelihood to the largest number is trade, and the largest number of
Indians is to be found probably within the Gold Area. If the Act stands, they must die out
in the natural course.
In the cablegram, the word "assent" occurs twice. It says the Bill has been assented to and
it refers to a deputation that is to wait on H.E. the Governor -General of South Africa
requesting him to withhold assent. The second use of the word "assent" refers probably to
a clause in the Letters Patent provi ding for the vetoing of class legislation. The clause is
undoubtedly to be used under exceptional circumstances. No one can deny that the
Asiatics Act111constitutes a very exceptional circumstance warranting the exercise of the
Royal veto.
The most import ant part of the cablegram, however, is the fact the commission promised
by the Union Government is to be appointed as a "concession" to "the detractors" of
Indians in the Union Parliament. Unless, therefore, the Government of India take care,
there is ever y likelihood of the commission, like the committee of the South African
Assembly, proving to the British Indians a curse instead of a blessing. It is, therefore, not
unnatural that the British Indian Association urges that H.E. the Viceroy should propose a
Royal Commission upon which both the Union and Indian interests are represented.
Nothing can be fairer than the proposal made by Mr. Asvat. I say so because, as a matter
of right, no commission is really needed to decide that Indian settlers are entitled to trade
in South Africa where they like and hold landed property on the same terms as the
European settlers. This is the minimum they can claim. But under the complex
constitution of this great Empire justice is and has often to be done in a round -about
manner. A wise captain instead of sailing against a headwind, tacks and yet reaches his
destination sooner than he otherwise would have. Even so, Mr. Asvat wisely accepts the
principle of a commission on a matter that is self -evident, but equally wisely wan ts a
commission that would not prove abortive and that will dare to tell the ruling race in
South Africa that, as members in an Empire which has more Coloured people than white,
they may not treat their Indian fellow -subjects as helots. Whether the above p roposal is
accepted or some other is accepted by the Imperial Government, it must be made clear to
them that public opinion in India will not tolerate confiscation of the primary rights of the
British Indian settlers in South Africa.

111Asiatic (Land and Trading) Amendment Act, No. 37 of 191928. LETTER TO THE TIMES OF INDIA , AUGUST 18, 1919112
Sir,
No possible exception can be taken to the impartial manner in which your South African
correspondent has given a summary of the Indian position in the Transvaal in your issue
of the 18th instant. He has put as fairly as it was possible for him to do both sides of the
question.
It is not the additional "brown burden on the top of the black one" which agitates the
European colonist s in South Africa, but the crux of the whole question is, as your
correspondent puts it, "that South Africa cannot be run economically with the Indian in it,
and the white people who have made the country cannot be expected to commit race
suicide." This is not the problem that presents itself to the Boer living on the veldt to
whom the Indian trader is a blessing, nor to the European housewife in the big towns of
the Transvaal who depends solely upon the Indian vegetable -vendor for the vegetables
brought to her door. But the problem presents itself in the manner put by your
correspondent to the petty European trader who finds in the thrifty and resourceful Indian
a formidable rival, and with his vote, which counts a great deal, and with his influence as
a me mber of the ruling race, he has succeeded in making his own economic problem a
race problem for South Africa. In reality, the problem is whether the petty trader for his
selfish end is to be allowed to override every consideration of justice, fair play, Im perial
policy and all that goes to make a nation good and great.
In support of the gradual but certain squeezing -out process, what has been called the
Smuts -Gandhi agreement has been pressed into service. Now that agreement is embodied
in two letters and two only of the 30th June, 1914, the first one addressed to me on behalf
of General Smuts by Mr. Gorges, Secretary of the Interior, and the second my
acknowledgement of it bearing the same date. The agreement, as the letters conclusively
show, is an agree ment on questions which were the subject of civil -in the
correspondence described as passive -resistance. The settlement stipulates only for an
extension -never a restriction -of existing rights, and, as it was intended only to cover
questions arising out of civil resistance, it left open all the other questions. Hence the
reservation in my letter of the 30th June, viz:
"As the Minister is aware, some of my countrymen wished me to go further. They
are dissatisfied that trade licences, laws of the dif ferent Provinces, the Transvaal
Gold Law, the Transvaal Law 3 of 1885, have not been altered so as to give them
full rights of residence, trade and ownership of land. Some of them are
dissatisfied that full interprovincial migration is not permitted, and s ome are
112This was reproduced also in Young India, August 20, 1919; and The Hindu andNew India , August 22,
1919.dissatisfied that on the marriage question the Relief Bill goes no further than it
does."
In this correspondence, there is not a word about the Indian settlers not getting trade
licences or (not) holding fixed property in the mining or any other area. And the Indians
had a perfect right to apply for and get as many trade licences as they could secure and as
much fixed property as they could hold, whether through forming registered companies
or through mortgages. After a strenuous fight of eight ye ars it was not likely that I would
give away any legal rights, and if I did, the community I had the honour to represent
would naturally and quite properly have dismissed me as an unworthy, if not a traitorous,
representative.
But there is a third letter , totally irrelevant considered as part of the agreement, which has
been used for the curtailment of trade rights. It is my letter of the 7th July addressed to
Mr. Gorges. The whole tone of it shows that it is purely a personal letter, setting forth
only m y individual views about "vested rights in connection with the Gold Law and
Township Amendment Act." I have therein stated definitely that I do not wish to restrict
the future action of my countrymen and I have simply recorded the definition of "vested
rights." I discussed with Sir Benjamin Robertson on the 4th March, 1914, saying that by
"vested rights I understand the right of an Indian and his successors to live and trade in
the township in which he was living and trading no matter how often he shifts hi s
residence or business from place to place in the same township." This is the definition on
which the whole of the theory of evasion of law and breach of faith has been based. Apart
from the question of irrelevance of the letter, I claim that it could not be used, even if it
could be admitted as part of the agreement, in the manner it has been. As I have already
stated on previous occasions, there was a prospect of an adverse interpretation of the
Gold Law as to trade licences, and there was the tangible d ifficulty in getting land or
leases of buildings and it was by the most strenuous efforts that Indians were able within
Gold Areas to retain their foothold. I was anxious to protect the existing traders and their
successors even though the legal interpreta tion of the law might be adverse to the Indian
claim . The vested right, therefore, referred to in my letter of the 7th July was a right
created in spite of the law. And it was this right that had to be protected in the
administration of the then existing l aws. Even if, therefore, my said letter can be
incorporated in the agreement, by no canon of interpretation that I know can it be said to
prevent the Indian morally (for that is the meaning of the charge of breach of faith) from
getting new trade licences in virtue of the law of the land. Indians openly and in a fair
fight gained in their favour a legal decision to the effect that they could obtain trade
licences against tender of the licence fee even within the Gold Area. To this they were
perfectly morall y entitled. There cannot be any question of a legal breach. Their trade
rivals would long ago have made short work of any legal breach. Lastly, supposing that
the law was adverse to the Indian claim, my definition could not be pleaded to bar any
agitation for amendment of the law, for the whole of the settlement, in the nature of it,
was of a temporary character; and the Indians, as definitely stated in my letter of the 30th
June, "could not be expected to rest content until full civil rights had been conce ded." The
whole of the plea, therefore, of breach of faith is, I venture to submit, an utterly dishonestand shameless piece of tactics, which ought not to be allowed to interfere with a proper
adjustment of the question.

29. LETTER TO THE TIMES OF INDIA , AUGUST 29, 1919
Sir,
I know that it can only be by patient efforts that one can hope to remove the
ignorance that must neces sarily attach to all questions arising a few thousand miles from
us. "Eureka" in letter published in your issue of the 28th instant is a case in point.113He
has raised many issues. I propose to confine myself only to the South African. The
question before the public today is not one of emigration but that of the livelihood and
status of those who have legally settled in South Africa, and neither Lord Sinha nor H.H.
the Maharaja of Bikaner114could give away inherent rights of citizens of the Empire, nor
didthey do any such thing. Indians have settled in South Africa for over 50 years; they
are not known to have lowered the standard of living. Will "Eureka" please remember
that the first Indian settlers were imported by the Europeans of South Africa? I refer to
the introduction of indentured Indians. I said in 1894, as I repeat now, that it was a
criminal blunder on the part of the greedy Europeans of Natal to have imported
indentured labour from India at miserably low wages when they had 400,000 stalwart
Zulu s in their midst who would gladly have worked if the employers had not wanted to
make enormous profits. Can South Africa, with any right on its side, starve the
descendants of the original settlers and the brethren out of existence?
It is pur poseless for me to go into the question how and by whom South Africa
was won; but let me correct "Eureka" by informing him that it was aid sent from India
under the late Sir George White which saved Ladysmith and which probably turned the
fortunes of war.115Let me further inform "Eureka" that the 10,000 troops that Sir George
White116took with him included many Indian followers who were just as indispensable
for the military operations as any soldier. Nor is this all. When the fate of Ladysmith
trembled in th e balance, when the late Lieut. Roberts, fighting against heavy odds, lost
his guns at the battle of Colenso, I had the honour to be in charge of the ambulance corps
of nearly 1,200 Indians, free and indentured, literate and illiterate, drawn from all clas ses.
113"Eureka" had written advising Gandhiji not to agitate about British Indian rights in South Africa and
argued that Indians had practically nothing to complain of as only Europeans had fought for and retained
South Africa.
114Indian delegates to the Imperi al Conference of July 1918
115The reference is to the Anglo -Boer War of 1899 -1902.
116Sir George White was Commander -in-Chief of the British forces in Natal.Some of the men who are now in peril of losing the means of their livelihood had the
privilege of bearing the stretcher that carried the dying lieutenant. The corps served too at
the reverse of Spion Kop. We were engaged to work without the range of f ire, not
because we had objected but because the authorities would not risk our lives, as we were
not trained for military operations. But Col. Gallway sent the message that, whilst we
were not obliged to work under fire, General Buller117would be glad if w e could remove
the wounded that were lying at the Field Hospital at the base of the hill. There was danger
of the Boers descending from the hill. Without the slightest hesitation and indeed with
gladness for the opportunity, every one of the men with me re sponded to the call and
removed the wounded to the base hospital at Frere Camp, a distance of 24 miles. The
wounded included the late General Woodgate and the brave soldiers under him. The
English newspapers and the politicians were so enthusiastic about this purely voluntary
work of the Indians that even laudatory verses were composed, whose refrain was "We
are sons of the Empire after all." Are these Indians of whom these verses were written
now to sing "We are helots of the Empire after all," for that i s what Indian settlers in
South Africa would be totally reduced to if the English and the Indian public of India do
not make a great effort to ward off the impending calamity. In my opinion, the case for
the European traders of South Africa is so hopelessl y bad that it has only to be
persistently, truthfully and calmly exposed to the whole of the Empire and it must fall to
pieces.

30. THE LATE MR. DAWOOD MOHAMED118
It has been my misfortune from time to time to report to the public deaths of Indians
who have worked for and served India in far -off South Africa. One of the ablest of them,
a cable from Mr. Rustomjee tells, just departed this life. His name was Dawood
Mohamed.
Mr. Dawood Mohamed rose from the ranks. He never received any English education.
I am not sure that he passed through more than two standards in a vernacular school in
India. But his versatile ability and perseverance gave him such a wonderful grasp over
languages without any book -learning whatsoever that I have known him hold discourses
with people in Tamil, Hindi, Creole French, Dutch and En glish besides his mother -
tongue, Gujarati. His native wit made him a popular speaker.
He was as keen a politician as he was a merchant. And when the critical moment for
117General Sir Redvers Henry Buller (1839 -1908), Commander -in-Chief of the British forces in South
Africa
118Letter to the press, August 30, 1919decision came he threw in his lot with the South African civil resisters, crossed the border
and together with other merchants of note presented himself for arrest for crossing the
sacred border of the Transvaal. Having carried on extensive business with European
business houses, he was well known to many Europeans and owing to his grea t ability
commanded their respect. And I am happy to be able to testify that for him who was used
to a luxurious life and who was at the time 50 years old, to have risked imprisonment for
the sake of conscience was an act which raised him still further in the estimation of his
many European friends rather than otherwise.
It was a privilege for me to find men in South Africa drawn from the commercial class
giving freely of their time, their money and even voluntarily risking loss of personal
freedom by undergoing imprisonment and property. Mr. Dawood Mohamed was one of
the best among these. He was President of the Natal Indian Congress for a number of
years and known to Indians all over South Africa. In my humble opinion, though India
knew him not, she has every reason to be proud of having produced Dawood Mohamed.
Indians in South Africa badly needed his services at the present moment. They are the
poorer for Mr. Dawood Mohammed’s death and, may I add, poorer also for the death of
that brave statesman, General Botha.119The duty of India is therefore all the greater to
see that the interests of her sons struggling for freedom are fully protected.
I am, etc.,

31. RETALIATION IS NO SOLUTION
Mr. Montagu’s reply to the deputation that waited on him on the South African
question is reassuring so far as it goes.120It is a matter for great satisfaction that he will
secure Indian representation upon the Commission, provided of course, that that
representation is equal to that of the anti -Asiatic party and provided further that the
Commission has no power to diminish the existing rights of British Indians, and provided
further that the Asiatic Bill just passed remains in abeyance and that the Commission is
given the power to recommend its withdrawal. The resolution of the managing committee
of the Imperial Indian Citizenship Association published in another column runs alon g
the lines suggested by us.
119General Louis Botha, first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa (1910 -1919), died in 1919.
120A deputation of Indians and British friends, led by Sir Surendranath Banerjee, called on E.S. Montagu,
Secreta ry of State for India, in London on August 28, 1919, to make representations about the position of
Indians in South Africa. Mr. Montagu assured them of his concern and informed them that he had asked
that the Indian Government be represented on the Commis sion by one official and one non -official.Past promises, considerations of equity and justice, the exemplary conduct of the Indian
settlers of South Africa, their contribution to the late South Africa war, at the time of the
Zulu rebellion and the European war, make a n overwhelming case against any diminution
of existing rights. The Commission, in order to be just and effective, can only
contemplate the relaxation, if not total removal, of the present restrictions for which
justification is only the strong prejudice ag ainst Indians on the part of the European
traders. But such unreasoning prejudice may be pleaded as a cause in a system of
government that is inefficient and corrupt. The Imperial Government to be truly Imperial
must have, under certain circumstances, be t hey ever so rare, powers of effective
intervention for the protection of weaker interests. It is therefore not possible for Indian
public opinion to accept Mr. Montagu's dictum that an exercise of the veto is politically
unfeasible. The veto is not merely a moral check but, in exceptional cases, it must prove a
very material and tangible check upon excesses and upon injustice. The Empire to hold
together must have some basic principles from which no member dare depart. If Mr.
Montagu is convinced, as he app arently is, of the injustice of the Asiatic Act and of its
controverting principles of the British Constitution where is the difficulty about vetoing
the Act? The utmost that can happen is that South Africa may secede from the Imperial
partnership. Surely it were a thousand times better that South Africa should cease to be a
member of the Empire than that it should corrupt and undermine the whole of the
Imperial fabric. It is infinitely better that the Empire has fewer partners than there are, but
all worki ng together in the same upward direction than that it should, by coquetting with
legalised confiscation and such other immoralities, sow the seeds of its own disruption.
And, after all, selfishness, greed and injustice are handmaidens of cowardice. There i s no
reason to fear that a wholesome and timely exercise of the Royal veto will create any
great stir in South Africa...
But I am free to confess that so long as milder measures are available, the extreme
remedy of vetoing ought not to be applied. It is undoubtedly like a strong blister causing
great though momentary pain, and, therefore, to be sparingly used. The proposed
Commission, if there is a strong Indian representation upon it, should prove effective
enough for the purpose to be attained. The thin g, therefore, for the time being is to
concentrate public opinion upon a strong Commission and a proper safeguarding
reference under which it should act.
It was great relief to find Mr. Montagu not falling into the "reciprocity" trap prepared by
Sir Will iam Meyer, let me hope in a hasty moment. I am sorry Mr. Banerjee so easily fell
into it. It is murdering the language to use so good a word as reciprocity for so bad a
cause as the one under notice. If we must go in for a bad thing, we must at least recog nise
it by its correct name -which is retaliation. Personally, I do not believe in retaliation at all.
It always in the end returns with redoubled force on the retaliator. The Times of India
which is rendering signal service to the cause of our countrymen in South Africa, very
rightly points out retaliation miscalled reciprocity can serve no earthly purpose in the
present case. "Its main objection is its utter futility," and if we ever embark upon this very
unpractical method, it will be hailed with satisf action by the anti -Asiatic party in South
Africa, and we shall be cursed by the hundred and fifty thousand Indians whose very
existence is at stake. One may retaliate when the stake is good. It is terrible to think of itwhen it is men and women who consti tute the stake. What comfort can it be to our
countrymen in South Africa for India to be able to send back a steamer -load of cargo
from South Africa, to refuse to send to South Africa a few tons of coal and to shut the
gates of India in the face of a stray South African tourist as against the banishment -for
that is virtually the goal of the anti -Asiatic party -of a hundred and fifty thousand Indian
settlers, or at least their reduction to helotry. The issue was stated by the late Sir William
Wilson Hunte r in clear and unmistakable language in 1896 or ’95. Writing on this very
question of British Indians in South Africa, he said, are they or not to enjoy the full status
of British citizens in His Majesty’s Dominions? It cannot be solved by the make -shift o f
retaliation or reciprocity by whatever term it is recognised. It can only be solved by
correct statesmanship and correct conduct on our part.
Young India , September 6, 1919; Collected Works , Volume 16, pages 87 -89
32. RETALIATION IS NO SOLUTION -II
The outcome of the deputation which the Honourable Surendranath Banerjee led
to the Secretary of State for India on the South African (question) may be regarded on the
whole as successful and we can now hope that our fellow -countrymen in th at far away
land will get justice without having to resort to satyagraha by way of civil disobedience.
Mr. Montagu has admitted that our case is perfectly just and assured us that the
Commission to be appointed in South Africa will have Indian representa tives. If the
representatives appointed are in truth representatives and if the four conditions laid down
by the Imperial Citizenship Association are fulfilled, we shall have no need to worry over
the outcome of the Commission. The conditions are: (1) that there should be an equal
number of Indian and white representatives; (2) that the Commission should have no
power to reduce the existing rights; (3) that the Commission should have the power to
recommend the withdrawal of the law just passed for depriving (Indians) of land and
trade rights; and (4) that this law should remain in abeyance pending the
recommendations of the Commission. The conditions are as necessary as they are
reasonable. Our countrymen fear that the Commission has not been appointed to ens ure
them justice by granting them further rights but to eliminate them from the whole of
South Africa, or permit them to stay on only as helots, as has happened in the Transvaal.
The best form which popular agitation on this issue can take at present is to secure Indian
representation (on the Commission) on these conditions.
We are sorry that Mr. Surendranath Banerjee walked into the trap laid by Sir
William Meyer. It was good that Mr. Montagu did not do so too. We trust that Sir
William Mey er laid the trap of "reciprocity" in a hasty moment and unintentionally. What
it amounts to is that, if in the end our countrymen in South Africa fail to secure justice,
we should punish the whites of South Africa. That is, if ever a white tourist happens to
come this way, he should be refused entry into India and should be debarred from
acquiring land here and the export of a ton or two of coal, if even that much, from India
to South Africa should be stopped. Even from a practical point of view, this sugge stionserves no purpose. If there is no discourtesy in saying so, acting on it would be like the
barking of dogs at an elephant from behind. The whites of South Africa will welcome it,
of course. South Africa’s trade with India is so insignificant and Sout h African whites
settled in India are so few that this kind of retaliation by us will be pointless.
We shall not only make ourselves ridiculous by advancing such a suggestion but also
invite upon ourselves the curses of our countrymen. A hundred and fifty thousand
children of India settled there will have to come away, leaving their property behind, or
live on merely as helots. What comfort can it be to them that the export of a few tons of
coal to South Africa will have been stopped or that a stray white from there will be
denied entry into India? The Times of India , which has been ably advocating this cause,
has also ridiculed Sir William Meyer’s suggestion.
If we go deeper, we shall see that any act of retaliation, even if severe enou gh in
comparison with the original wrong, only recoils upon the person who resorts to it.
What the hand does but hurts one’s own heart.121An injustice can never be cured by
another in return. Injustice cannot remove injustice. Even if a hundred and fifty thousand
whites were settled in India and we could pass against them, and did in fact pass, the
same kind of laws as obtain in South Africa, how would that prevent the ruin of the
hundred and fifty thousand Indians? The principle of tit for tat is b ased on the assumption
that the other party is deterred from doing injustice when we have the ability and the will
to pay him back in his own coin. This does indeed happen sometimes. It is well known,
however, that the total result does not advance the cau se of justice; for, countless men
have acted on the age -old principle of a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye, but
injustice has not disappeared. Besides, far -sighted writers in the West, too, have been
saying that, despite the great advance of scienc e in Europe and the opportunities for
education which exist there, hatred and injustice have not diminished. We have direct
evidence of this before our very eyes. But we have strayed from the subject. That we can
see no meaning in Sir William Meyer’s sugge stion even from a practical point of view -
as a means of retaliation -is sufficient to show that it deserves to be rejected.
Mr. Montagu has stated that an exercise of the veto is politically unfeasible. "Veto"
signifies the power retained by the King to disallow a law passed in any Dominion of the
British Empire. Mr. Montagu’s statement amounts in effect to saying that the Dominion
of South Africa is so strong and enjoys such freedom that, if the King’s Ministers advised
him to disallow the law passed by it and if the King accepted such advice, there would
perhaps be a commotion in the Dominion. This means merely that a partner in the British
Empire would secede from the partnership. In this Empire even the weakest person
should be protected from injust ice and if, in the process, any of the partners secede, the
result should be wholly welcome. The British Empire cannot -no Empire can -endure if
it holds even its weakest subjects as slaves for ever, as mere hewers of wood and drawers
of water. An Empire that would last has therefore no choice but to abandon those parts of
it that always act in opposition to its aims.
121Gujarati sayingAs a matter of fact, there is no strong reason to believe that the whites of South Africa
will raise an outcry if the veto is used. Injus tice, immorality and the like are always
cowardly and timid. To start with, such fanatics make a great show of strength and finally
yield before the force of justice. The anti -Indian movement in South Africa is based on
such rank injustice that, if the Imp erial Government were to display even a little strength,
it cannot survive. To ensure that the Imperial Government displays such strength, only
one thing needs to be done. If we raise a dignified but powerful protest and act likewise
with strength on behal f of our countrymen overseas living their lives in difficult
conditions, we shall strengthen the hands of the Imperial Government and enable it to
secure justice for them.
Though we have shown that the Royal veto can be used effectively, we must confess t hat
it is a weapon which must be used sparingly. We believe, as Mr. Montagu does, that a
Royal Commission will secure justice. At the present time, therefore, we must
concentrate on efforts to see that everything goes well with the Commission.

considered unsatisfactory. The decision to send Sir Benjamin Robertson to present our
case is a welcome one. His presence there cannot but have a powerful effect on the
whites of South Africa. The cables we have received from that country suggest that the
white traders there are still bent on mischief and complain that the new law is not being
properly administered. In these circumstances, the presence of a representative of the
Indian Government will prove useful on issues of this kind. According to my
understanding of His Excellency the Viceroy’s pronouncement, the representatives
referred to in Mr. Montagu's pronouncement will also be appointed. If these
representatives are strong and independent men, I have no doubt that they can be very
effective and the injustices from which our countrymen suffer will be very much
mitigated.

35. THE TRANSVAAL ASIATICS
The news received last week from the Transvaal adds fat to the fire. At a
Congress of representatives of municipalities in the Transvaal, merchants associations,
trade unions and other institutions, a resolution was passed to the effect that the
administration of the anti -Asiatic laws was slack and needed tightening up. The Congress
has protested against giving citizenship rights to Asiatics. It has, moreover, decided to
establish a South Africans` Le ague, in other words, an association of the whites of South
Africa. The object of this association will be to acquire the immovable property at present
owned by Asiatics after paying them reasonable compensation and to take all possible
measures to elimina te skilfully the Asiatics living and doing business in the Transvaal.123
Another telegram received from Pretoria is also suggestive of the feelings of the
whites. Representatives of municipalities, merchants’ associations and other institution s
gathered at a mammoth meeting, where the question of the Transvaal Asiatics was
discussed.124The chairman painted a dark future for South Africa if the problem
123A conference was held in Pretoria, under the auspices of the Anti -Asiatic League, in September 1919,
soon after the promulgation of the anti -Asiatic Act, to form an o rganisation to combat "the Asiatic
menace." Participants included representatives of 26 municipalities, 30 Chambers of Commerce, 12
Churches, 9 agricultural societies, 40 unions and other bodies in the Transvaal.
This conference set up a "South Afri cans’ League" -under the chairmanship of L. J. Phillips, attorney in
Krugersdorp -and soon branches were formed all over the Transvaal.
The objectives of the Association were reproduced in Young India , October 15, 1919.
124The reference is probably to the same meeting as in the previous paragraph -the first Congress of the
South Africans` League, held in Pretoria.remained unsolved. The meeting passed a resolution moved by Mr. Munnik125to the
effect that the ever increasing influence of Asiatics held a serious threat to the economic
and social life of the Transvaal whites. Hence immediate legislation to solve the problem
was advocated.
TheCape Times , severely criticising Mr. Montagu's reply to the deputatio n which
waited on him under the leadership of Mr. Surendranath Banerjee, says that the Secretary
of State for India was not well -informed about the difficult and delicate problem in the
Transvaal. The paper reminds him that the Government had cast all its weight against the
amendment moved by Mr. Collins to the law recently passed in the Transvaal in which he
sought to prevent Indians from carrying on trade in any part of the Transvaal. Mr.
Montagu should have made it clearer to the deputation that the Unio n Parliament had
very much appreciated India’s help to the Empire and should have detailed with greater
understanding the difficulties experienced by the Government of South Africa in solving
the Indian problem.

36. LETTER TO U.K. TRIVEDI126
(After October 18,1919)
Dear Sir,
I have your letter.127
I suggest the enclosed cable128to Johannesburg. I suggest further that you should
address the Commerce and Industry Department drawing attention to the fact that the
whole question of disabilities regarding ownership of land and right to trade shall be
sifted. The matter is rather del icate. It would be useless to press for opening the whole
question, political and commercial, throughout South Africa. As Mr. Shastriar129is
almost certain to be appointed there is no anxiety regarding the Commission.
Yours faithfully,

37. INTERVIEW TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA,
NOVEMBER 1, 1919
It is a matter of very great regret that Mr. Montagu’s message to His Excellency
the Viceroy so materially alters t he position. I do, however, feel that any agitation
insisting upon the appointment on the Commission of Indian representatives may damage
our case which is so overwhelmingly strong.130If a representative, like Mr. Sastri, is
appointed along with Si r Benjamin Robertson to put before the South African
Government and the forthcoming Commission the Indian case, it would be the next best
thing. In my opinion, our effort should be concentrated upon securing a proper reference
to the Commission in the plac e of the very narrow one, which we are led to believe, is
likely to be suggested by the Union Government. The Times of India is really rendering a
great service in moulding and consolidating public opinion on this question, irrespective
of class or race. I t is not enough that merely the trade question is referred to the
Commission. The whole of the Law 3 of 1885 must come under review, leaving aside, for
the time being, the question of the political status. Our goal must be the restoration of full
trading a nd property rights of Indians lawfully settled in South Africa. This is what even
Australia has allowed, although it was Australia which led the anti -Asiatic cry. We must
also guard against the Commission whittling down any of the rights already being
enjoyed by the settlers. By no canon of justice or propriety can the existing rights be
taken away from the Indian settlers, but if we do not take care and provide beforehand,
there is every danger of such a catastrophe happening. It actually happened with the
Select Committee of the Union Parliament whose findings produced the new legislation
we so much deplore...

38. NOTE OF INTERVIEW ON SOUTH AFRICA131
November 3, 1919
130The reference is to the Asiatic Inquiry Commission appointed by the Union Government in February
1920 to inquire into laws concerning the right of Asiatics to trade and acquire land in the Union. Mr.
Montagu indicated that the Commission would not inc lude a member to represent India as had been
expected in India.
Sir Benjamin Robertson attended the sittings of the Commission as an observer representing the
Government of India.
131This is apparently Sir George Barnes’ report of the intervie w he had had with Gandhiji concerning the
South African Commission. See below, "Letter to Sir George Barnes, November 7, 1919."He (Gandhiji) s aid that he was very sorry that the Union Government were unwilling to
allow representatives from India to sit upon the Commission. He said that he was going
to do what I had asked him to do in my letter, namely, not to raise an agitation himself on
the su bject, and to do all he could to repress any agitation raised by others. He told me
that he had been interviewed during the last day or two, and he had said that he regarded
the arrangement made as second best.
I asked him whether he had any strong views on the point, whether the terms of reference
to the Commission ought to be enlarged beyond trading rights, and pointed out to him
that the recent effort of the Indians to get an enquiry had resulted in what might be
regarded as a restriction of the existi ng rights. He said that he felt strongly that the
enquiry ought to extend to the Law of 1885, and considered that an extension in this
direction could not possibly result in a restriction of the existing rights.
I asked him his views on the subject of in ter-provincial emigration. He said:
"I would not ask for this, for I know that we shall not get it. Freedom of
emigration between the provinces would mean freedom to migrate from the
Transvaal into the Orange Free State. The Orange Free State has always
prohibited the entry of Indians, and there is hardly any Indian in the whole State."
I further asked him what he felt about movement from one province to another with the
intention of returning. A man might, for instance, want to attend the funeral of a relative
living over the border. He said:
"I know the South African people, and I fully realise the difficulties which exist. I
do not want to fall into the error of asking for what is unwise and what we know
we shall not get."
He asked me who was to be the Indian representative before the Commission. I told him
that the Union Government had not yet consented to any Indian, but that both the Viceroy
and the Secretary of State were entirely at one in wishing for an Indian representative and
had urged th at one should be received. He asked me whether it was true that Mr. Sastri’s
name had been suggested by the Viceroy and the Secretary of State. I told him that this
was true. He said:
"I do not think a better selection could possibly have been made."
Mr. Gandhi said that he hoped that I would send for him at any time I thought he would
be useful and said that he was quite willing to leave Amritsar or Lahore, wherever he was,
to give help over the South African question.
Collected Works , Volume 16, pag es 280 -8139. LETTER TO SIR GEORGE BARNES, NOVEMBER 7, 1919
With reference to our conversation, I enclose herewith my note as to the minimum to be
included in the reference to the forthcoming South African Commission.
It is assumed for the purpose of this note that General Smuts contemplates referring to the
Commission the question of trading rights of Indians in the Transvaal only.
If so, it will not in any way settle the most urgent question.
The new Act deals with and adversely af fects the rights of owning land and trading. It is
therefore suggested that the question of trading and owning land, i.e. the laws of 1885
and the Townships Act and the Gold Law in so far as the latter two affect the rights of
Indians to own land and to tr ade within the townships or the Gold Areas be referred to the
Commission.
It should be clearly understood as between the Union Government and the Government
of India that the new Act in so far as it diminishes existing rights should be revised and
that t he findings of the Commission should not in any way restrict existing rights. The
Commission is likely to prove injurious to the existing rights, small as they are, if the
above two conditions are not fulfilled.
My proposal should be taken and treated as a whole or rejected altogether.
In making the proposal, I am going against the most moderate public opinion
here and against the demands made by the South African Indians’ Conference recently
held at Johannesburg.132
Public opinion here as expressed in the Times of India requires the restoration of trading
rights and ownership of land throughout the Union and the inter -provincial migration.
This means entry into the Orange Free State and the rights to trade and own land there. In
the presen t state of public feeling this may be difficult for General Smuts to achieve even
if he himself is willing.
The demand of the Conference is wider still and includes the restoration of the political
status and the abolition of all legal disabilities. Thou gh this and this alone must be the
goal to be aimed at, I recognise that it is not practical politics to strive for it as an
immediate aim.
But, if neither the Indian demand nor the lesser one expressed by the Times of India is to
be urged, it must be cl early understood that there should be no diminution of the existing
status.
132The first national conference of Indians in South Africa was held in August 1919 to protest against Act
No. 37 of 1919. Please see footnote to item 27.The Union Government having already opened the question of trade and ownership of
property in the Transvaal, through the Select Committee and then the recent legislation,
the Com mission can well be asked to entertain both these questions without ruffling the
prejudices of the white population. It should be remembered that, at the time of the
passage of the recent Act, Indians in the Transvaal had the right to receive licences to
trade practically on the same footing as the Europeans and could under the existing law
become virtual owners of land by taking mortgages or forming limited liability
companies. I contemplate statutory recognition of the right to trade under general sanitar y
control and the direct ownership of land in the Transvaal. This is not claiming much or
more than they have virtually enjoyed.
So far regarding the reference.
There is the unsatisfactory administration of the Immigrants’ Restriction Act which can
beimproved by diplomatic action without troubling the Commission. The points
requiring attention are:
1.The movement of the Indian settlers from one province to another not for residing
but for ceremonial or business visits or for mere passage to the provinc e of
domicile. Full facilities without fee should be granted.
2.The entry of fresh Indians for supplying the needs of the resident population
should be placed on a better and more liberal basis.
3.There should be greater liberality in permitting plural wives to visit their husbands
without creating any legal rights for them or their issue.
4.Restrictions on passports from India or from the Union require complete
overhauling whether regarding identification or otherwise.
5.Men and women of status and students sh ould have freedom to travel to South
Africa.
These matters, if they cannot be dealt with diplomatically, should be included in the
reference to the forthcoming Commission.

40. SOUTH AFRICAN CO MMISSION
The news about South Africa appearing in the papers is both startling and distressing. We
were led by Mr. Montagu’s words to believe that the Commission on the rights of Indians,
which is to be appointed in South Africa, would have some members t o represent us. Mr.
Montagu now informs us that his words were misunderstood and that no one will be
appointed on the Commission to represent India. However, Sir Benjamin Robertson willbe accompanied by a non -official and the two will present our case. Th is is disappointing
news for us. We think General Smuts did not have his way and it did not become possible
to include anyone from India. So we have had to telegraph Mr. Montagu to set the matter
right. But we shall not succeed, through agitation, in getti ng our men appointed on the
Commission. Mr. Montagu can insist on justice being done to us, but it is the South
African Government alone which can decide the manner of doing it. Hence, we cannot
compel it to appoint anybody from here on its Commission. Eve n then, if an able man
like Mr. Shastriar133is appointed by the Government, he and Sir Benjamin Robertson
together will be able to secure justice.
The more startling news which we have received is that the Commission will investigate
only the issue of trad ing licences. Such a limited inquiry will not serve the purpose. We
shall have to carry on a strong agitation about this. The Commission should be given
more powers. The Indians in South Africa have demanded that the inquiry should cover
all their rights. We think it will be difficult to bring this about. But we can certainly
demand that the inquiry should cover rights of trading and ownership of land; these are
our minimum rights. What we have to be more vigilant about is lest the Commission
should be empo wered to recommend deprivation of the existing rights. It should have no
power to recommend abrogation of any of the rights which existed at the time of the
passing of the new law. Indians have now almost stopped emigrating to South Africa.
The system of i ndentured labour having been discontinued, the resulting increase in the
Indian population there has also stopped. Hence the only question that remains is that of
the rights of Indians settled there. They must be allowed to trade honestly and to acquire
and dispose of land. There is no room for differences of opinion on this point. The whites
of South Africa cannot keep the Indians there merely as slaves or coolies.
Fortunately, the good Mr. Andrews134has come forward to help our brethren and
is proceeding there. The service he has rendered it is impossible to estimate. Wherever he
hears the cry of Indians in distress, he runs to their help. Fiji, Ceylon and the Punjab bear
witness to this. In South Africa, he is well known both to the whites a nd the Indians. And
so his going there will inspire courage in our brethren and give us hope that justice will
be done.

41. INDIANS ABROAD
South Africa, East Afric a and Fiji present today problems for solution and test our
capacity for nationalism. Not until we feel for the meanest of our countrymen as each one
133V. S. Srinivasa Sastri
134The Reverend C. F. Andrewsof us feels for himself, can we be said to have a consciousness of our nationality. Those
of our countryme n who have settled in the different parts of the world look to us for
guidance, help and protection.
And just as the spirit of nationality is being tested, so is that of imperialism. If
imperialism means anything, it must mean and include the capacity fo r protecting all
interests that belong to it. According to that test, Indians who have settled abroad claim
double protection, viz., from us and from the Imperial Government. And yet, both seem
so far to have mainly failed in the discharge of their trust.. .
South Africa is really the most difficult of all. We reproduce in this issue the text
of General Smuts’ not unsympathetic reply to the Indian deputation that waited on him.135
Never has a community been engaged in an unequal fight such as o ur countrymen are in
South Africa. Compared to their rivals they are poor. They have no political power and
they have been engaged ever since 1880 in protecting the right to exist with self -respect -
a right which any civilised Government would not deny ev en to utter strangers. It speaks
volumes for their courage and resourcefulness that they have been able to hold their own
in the manner they have.

42. SPEECH AT THE THIRTY -FOURTH SESSION OF THE INDIAN
NATIONAL CONGRESS, AMRITSAR, DECEMBER 29, 1919
Gandhiji, in proposing the second resolution said the resolution entrusted to him
was a very important one. All the Indians were agreed that India was entitled to
responsi ble government. If that was so, they must render help to their brothers and sisters
who were at that time suffering in South Africa.
135General Smuts told the deputation that he was out for fair play and justice for all in the Union. The
Indian community ought also to realise that there was a very strong and a powerfully backed up movement
afoot to curtail the progress of the Indian community. It would be inadvisable in the interest of the
community to rake up all the past matters and have them included in terms of reference of the proposed
Commission. It woul d be better if the trading matter alone is once for all gone into thoroughly. As the
Indians are not anxious to acquire any fixed property, that matter should be left out.
He also pointed out that Sir Benjamin Robertson is coming out to watch the interest and assist the
Indian community and it would, therefore, be to the interest of the Indians themselves to render all the
assistance they can both to Sir Benjamin and the Commission.
He concluded by saying that he was very anxious to be on the best of terms with the Indian Government
and those settled in the Union. He would endeavour under his Government to give fair play to all. Being in
a great hurry to meet another deputation, he regretted that he could not give the time he desired to the
deputation, but the facts will not slip his memory. The Commission may give us a couple of years’
rest until another agitation breaks out and we shall see then what could be done. Young India , December 24,
1919; Collected Works , Volume 16, pa ges 551 -52Gandhiji traced the introduction of the indenture system to the request of the whites of
Natal in South Africa to the Indian Government for Indian labour. That system, he was
bound to say, was enormously worse than life in the Indian jails. Sir William Hunter had
called it a system of slavery. Under this system their brethren had gone to South Africa.
The success of Indi ans in trade had given rise to those tyrannies under which they were
now suffering. Their trade was crushed. It was ruled that indentured labourers could not
enter into trade but must live under indenture. It was said that Indians were of dirty habits,
andbeing of a different civilisation from the whitemen’s, the latter could not live with
them. False charges were laid against them and it was tried to send them back to India.
South Africa was the place where the Indians had fought in order to keep up the
honour of their country and twenty thousand men had to go to jail for it. The result was
that they were allowed to remain there.
In 1914 several privileges were granted to the Indians. Similar was the case of the
Transvaal. The Indians there wanted proprietary rights and rights of trade, but these were
denied to them. They wanted the Indian Government to secure those rights for them and
to use means to maintain the honour of India... Gandhiji then read the resolution which
was as follows:
"(a) This Congress protests against the attempt being made in South Africa and
particularly to deprive the Indian settlers of the right of property and trade hitherto
enjoyed by them and trusts that the Government of India will secure the repeal of
the recently enac ted legislation and otherwise ensure the protection of the status
of the Indian settlers in South Africa..."

43.LETTER TO SIR GEORGE BARNES, JANUARY 13, 1920
Dear Sir George Barnes,
I enclose herewith a cablegram I have received from South Africa.136You will
perhaps easily understand reference to the Krugersdorp case.137It means that the partial
prote ction that was attempted to be secured by the new Act has been undone by the latest
judgement. The judgement is under appeal, and assuming that the appeal also is decided
against us -the verdict cannot be accepted. Courts of law provide no remedy where th e
law itself is defective. This was forcibly illustrated when a High Court judgement upset
the South African practice which recognised Indians’ marriages as lawful138and you
136This telegram is not available.
137Krugersdorp Municipality v. Dadoo Ltd. See below, "Letter to the press" (before January 25, 1920)
138The reference is to a judgement by Mr. Justice Searle of the Cape Supreme Court on March 14, 1913,know that the legislation of 1914139remedied the mischief created by the judgement i n
question and I trust that you will see to it and instruct Sir Benjamin Robertson that the
right of Indians to hold landed property by forming corporations otherwise is not in any
way interfered with.
The second point raised in the cablegram is in conne ction with the Commission that is
now sitting to consider the proposed extension of the power of the municipalities. It does
seem strange that one should ever have to dread extension of popular power, but here
where the power is sought in order to crush th e very life of the unrepresented people, any
further extension of such power is really a crime. I hope therefore that Sir Benjamin
Robertson will see that any law that may be passed to extend the existing powers of the
municipalities of South Africa will d uly safeguard the rights of Indians who are totally
unrepresented in the municipalities of the Transvaal and the (Orange) Free State and only
partially in the Cape and Natal...
Yours sincerely

44. LETTER TO THE PRESS, JANUARY 1920140
The following is the extension of a cable received by me from Mr. Asvat,
Chairman of the British Indian Association, Transvaal, regarding the Krugersdorp
Municipality v. Dadoo Ltd., referred to in the memorandum presented to the Union
Premier:
"THE COURT HAS SET ASIDE THE TRANSFERS. IT HELD

NEW ACT 37141GIVES NO PROTECTION EVEN TO OLD COMPANIES AND
TRADERS. THE POSITION IS MOST PRECARIOUS. STRENUOUS ACTION
IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE SAKE OF SAVIN G THE COMMUNITY."
This cablegram cannot fail to disconcert those who have at all studied the South African
question, for, as Mr. Asvat says, it is calculated to undo even the little that the new Act
was claimed to accomplish. Dadoo, Ltd., is an old -estab lished Indian company in
Krugersdorp. It holds extensive landed property in that township, and the meaning of the
cablegram is that the transfers registered in the name of the company of landed properties
are illegal, because, as the Court seems to have co ntended, the transaction was in fraud of
the law and that legislation could not be laughed at. I wish to say nothing regarding the
propriety of the judgement or the reasoning on which it seems to be based.
Thousands of pounds worth of landed property is registered in the names of companies in
which Indians enjoy a dominating position. If the judgement stands, everyone of these
companies will become dispossessed of the land they have occupied for years, lands
which they have acquired openly and under legal advice and which has been registered in
the Land Registry Office with the full knowledge of all the circumstances by the
registrars, and only last year, when the new disabling Act was passed by the South
African Legislature, we were told that the holding of land in this manner, prior to July 31
last, would not be affected by the legislation, and in justification of the measure, we were
told by all the speakers in the Union Assembly that the legislation would protect existing
companies and mortgages. The ju dgement in question comes, therefore, as an eye -opener.
I venture to submit that, even if the judgement is sound, it evidently frustrates the
intention of the Legislature and deprives Indians of rights they have enjoyed without
question for years past. I hold that the impending sin must be averted, even if it is to be
done by special legislation, as was done in 1914 in connection with the legal recognition
of Indian marriages.
The second point raised in the cablegram refers to a magisterial judgement, an d it means
that Indians as Indians may be declared as undesirable, not on ground of insanitation or
immorality, but because they compete with the European traders to their detriment. If this
doctrine were to hold good, not a single Indian can engage
in any trade whatever in South Africa.142
141Asiatic (Land and Trading) Act, No. 37 of 1919
142A Guj arati version of the letter in Navajivan , January 25, 1920, has the following additional paragraph:
"The third point raised in the cable is about the proposed increase in the powers of
municipalities. Ordinarily, everyone wou ld welcome such an increase but, looking to what has happened in
the present case, in South Africa and the other Colonies, this increase will mean investing the
municipalities with powers to prosecute the dependent and disenfranchised classes. In the event , the latter
will find the increased powers of the municipalities not to their benefit but to their detriment. In the
Transvaal and the Free State, Indians have no political or municipal franchise. They have a measure of
franchise in Natal and the Cape, bu t not sufficient to enable them to influence the working of municipalitiesSir Benjamin Robertson will presently sail for South Africa. His diplomatic talent
and his trusteeship will be taxed to the utmost before he secures, not a full status for the
Indians in South Africa, but eve n tolerably respectable footing for them to secure, i.e., the
right to trade and own landed property without restriction, save such as are common to all
as well in theory as in practice. One can only hope that the Government of India will
speak to the Unio n Government in no uncertain terms on this question, and that the public
and the press will strengthen their hands.

45. STATEMENT ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN COMMISSION,
FEBRUARY 9, 1920143
I do not think that the Commission is a strong Commission. Certainly it is not an
impartial Commission.144So far as the terms of reference are concerned, I am not
disposed to quarrel with them. Indeed I would have, if it was at all possible, avoi ded a
Commission altogether and obtained relief regarding land and trading by other means.
But I am inclined to think that it is possible for Sir Benjamin Robertson to secure the
rights of ownership of land and trading which are in imminent danger. The wh ole
situation hinges round the strength that the Government of India through Sir Benjamin
Robertson puts forth. It is difficult for me to go further in the absence of any cablegram
from South Africa which I expect hourly from our people. It is a matter of great
consolation that Mr. Andrews is on the spot.145He knows the people and he knows the
members of the present South African Ministry and other public men of South Africa.

46.PRESS STATEMENT ON THE REPATRIATION SCHEME,
or to have their wishes respected."
143Made to a representative of The Tribune
144The Asiatics Inquiry Commission, appointed by the South African Government to enquire into the
questi on of Asiatics trading and holding land in South Africa, was composed of four South African whites
and was chaired by Sir Johannes Lange.
The Commission sat from March to July 1920 and was "assisted" by Sir Benjamin Robertson who
attended as an observer on behalf of the Government of India. It submitted an interim report on May 12,
1920, and a final report on March 3, 1921.
145The Reverend C.F. Andrews was in Africa from December 1919 to March 1920.JUNE 13, 1920146
With reference to the approval that seems to have been accorded to the scheme of
repatriation, said to have been recommended by the South African Commission and
accepted by the Union Government, I would respectfully caution the public against
accepting the proposed scheme.
The public have not the interim report of the Commission. We do not know the
conditions of repatriation. It seems to me therefore that it is most hazardous to venture
any opin ion at all on a scheme of which we have a most imperfect knowledge. Generally
it must be stated that any scheme of State repatriation must be looked upon with the
gravest suspicion, especially when the scheme is fathered by those who are
uncompromisingly h ostile to Indian aspirations. The Indians of South Africa are able to
remain in that country because of their domicile. I very much fear that the proposed
scheme will be found to involve forfeiture of domicile against acceptance of repatriation
money, that is, passage back to India and possibly a trifling sum as pocket -money. I am
inclined to think that apart from everything else such considerations will be wholly
insufficient for giving away a valuable right. I would hardly call any such repatriation as
purely voluntary.
This, however, is one of the many objections that may be advanced against the proposed
repatriation. I have no doubt that the best thing is to suspend judgement till we have the
full scheme before us for examination. It is to be hoped tha t the Government of India will
take the public fully into its confidence before pronouncing upon the scheme.

Indian Opinion recently received. As it reads the report seems to be harmless. Even the
word "repatriation" does not occur in it. It is a cautiously -worded docu ment. And as
there seems to be no opposition to the recommendation from the resident Indian
population, I am not inclined to oppose the proposal of the Commission. At the same
time there is no mistaking its intention. Indeed they have not even attempted to conceal it,
for they ask His Excellency the Governor of South Africa "to appoint an official well
acquainted with the Indian mind and their methods to act in a sympathetic manner and
lay before the Indians the advantages of immediately returning to India" . The case for the
scheme is that the Indians are anxious to return and that the scheme satisfies that anxiety

the Asiatics Inquiry Commission, in its interim report, that immediate steps be taken to initiate a scheme to
encourage and assist Indians who were prepared to return to India.
147Released through the Associated Press of Indiawhereas the anxiety seems to be all on the part of the Commission and their return is to
be stimulated by placing its advantages before our sorel y tried countrymen. The working
of the scheme will, however, require ceaseless watching. There should be no compulsion
of any kind whatsoever and no forfeiture of rights of domicile. I was pleased to notice
absence of any reference to such forfeiture in th e interim report. One however never
knows what undertaking may not be taken from the poor returning Indians against the
grant of free passage. If the scheme is benevolently intended to relieve the present
distress the Union Government will simply facilitat e the return of those who are unable to
support themselves in South Africa, without bargaining for the forfeiture of domicile. To
insist upon the loss of that valuable right would be to take a mean advantage of the
distressful condition of some of our coun trymen in South Africa.

48. LETTER TO THE PRESS ON SOUTH AFRICAN COURT’S
JUDGEMENT, JULY 11, 1920
I have received the following cablegram from Johannesburg:
"INDADOO V ERSUS KRUGERSDORP MUNICIPALITY THE LEGALITY OF
ASIATIC COMPANIES OWNING FIXED PROPERTY APPELLATE COURT
UPHELD APPEAL. JUSTICES ROSE -INNES, SOLOMON, MAARSDORP,
JUTA AND DE VILLIERS COMPOSED THE BENCH. JUSTICE DE VILLIERS
ONLY DISSENTED."
This cablegram means relief for our harassed countrymen in South Africa. It
would be remembered that the High Court of the Transvaal had decided against
Indian companies holding fixed properties as being fraudulent of law.148The appellate
court has evi dently taken a different view and sustained the Indian contention that the
transactions of the Asiatic companies were perfectly legal.

49. UNCANNY
There is something unc anny about the repatriation scheme of South Africa. I had
never dreamt that the interim report had the slightest connection with the Indians Relief
Act of 1914. I have now read the full text of that Act and had a discussion with Mr.
Andrews also. Till the latter drew my attention to the fact, I had even forgotten that there
was a section in the Act itself regarding the granting of free passages against forfeiture of
148Please see item 44 above.domicile.149The Government communiqué150confirms Mr. Andrews’s information.
What puzzles me is the fact that it has been found at all necessary to have an interim
report in order to enforce the free passage section of the Relief Act. That section takes the
place of the several sections of different Acts of the Natal legislation repealed by the Act.
These sections provided for the grant of free passage to those who were under liability to
pay the £3 tax, if the latter wanted to escape the payment of the tax or re -indenture. The
section in question though designed to affect these people was made gener ally applicable.
But the debate in the Assembly made perfectly clear the scope of the section. The
contention at the time was that those who paid the £3 tax really did not become domiciled,
and if after they ceased to pay the tax, they wanted to take advan tage of the free passage
section, they should forfeit the right of domicile which was at that time considered to be
an equitable settlement of the very hotly debated question of the removal of a tax which
had been in vogue for nearly twenty years. The inte rim report somewhat alters the scope
of the section, but I am personally not afraid because the section requires a written
application for a free passage which is a difficult thing to obtain from any Indian in Natal,
and it can only happen in the case of those indentured Indians who having become free
are at the present moment unable to support themselves. Not many Indians are likely to
take advantage of the section and forfeit their domicile; at the same time I cannot help
feeling that an illegitimate use is being attempted to be made of the section that was
designed not to meet cases of poverty but to meet cases of doubtful domicile, i.e., cases in
which it was open to the anti -Asiatic party to argue that domicile had not been acquired.
Today six years af ter the repeal of the tax every Indian under liability to pay that tax has
acquired statutory domicile. It is against my idea of right that a Government should take
advantage of distress of men and seek to deprive them of a precious right. It would be
better not to issue the scheme under unequal conditions. However I derive satisfaction
from the fact that in spite of the machinery that is being set up not many Indians would
take the doubtful advantage of the scheme.

50. REPORT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN COMMISSION
Despite the mission of Sir Benjamin Robertson, the South African Commission
has delivered an adverse finding.151Commissions, Lord Morley152has often said, serve
no usef ul purpose. They raise false hopes, and, for the time being, divert public attention
from mat ters they are appointed to deal with. They give time for passions to cool down.
But they rarely do justice. Indeed, it is notorious that Commissions avoid abstra ct justice.
149Section 6 of the Indians Relief Act authorised the Minister, in his discretion, to pay passage to India for
any Indian not entitled to it under Natal Law of 1891 if the latter gave a writt en undertaking -on behalf of
himself, his wife and minor children -abandoning rights of domicile or residence in the Union.

151The Asiatic Inquiry Commission, in its report of March 3, 1921, rejected allegations of "Asiatic
menace," but made a series of recommendations which were detrimental to the Indians in South Africa.

152John Morley, Viscount Morley of Blackburn (1838 -1923); Se cretary of State for India, 1905 -10They offer, or effect, compromises. But the South African Commission has offered, or
effected, no compromise. It has delivered the Indian in the hands of his white rival in
trade. It has reaffirmed the principle of white supremacy, as Mr. Andre ws often puts it.
The principle has almost become a passion and a religion. In 1901, the late Sir
Pherozeshah153rated me for "wasting my time," as he put it, on South Africa. During the
satyagraha campaign, he was the last, as he said himself, to be enthus ed. And when he
was enthused, it was not the justice of the cause (which he never doubted) but it was the
incarceration of Mrs. Gandhi154which roused his chivalrous spirit, and threw him into the
struggle. He used to say that I should return to India and wo rk for the freedom of the
whole of India, rather than for a handful of Indians in South Africa.
I thought then, as I think even now, that whilst the uncrowned king of the Presidency of
Bombay was right about concentrating on India’s freedom, he was wrong in thinking that
I should have withdrawn from South Africa. We dare not neglect our countrymen abroad.
The battle of India’s freedom involves the protection of the rights of the least of our
countrymen, no matter where they might be situated. But at the pr esent moment, I must
invite our countrymen in South Africa to carry on their battle bravely and single -handed,
and help us here in the best way they can. India’s fate must be decided one way or the
other (and so far as I know only one way) during this year . We shall be better able to
protect them then than now.
The South African problem bears the same character as the problem at home. We
too are fighting the religion of white supremacy... Either that supremacy must go in its
entirety, or thos e of us who recognise the tubercular nature of the disease must perish in
the attempt to combat it. The Government of India can, if they wish, put up an energetic
and open fight against the proposed breach of faith which the Commission implies. The
spirit of the settlement of 1914 was that the position of the Indian all over South Africa
must be levelled up, not a single right then existing should be in any way endangered.
The Commission has not only put its imprimatur on the encroachments already made on
existing rights, but it has itself suggested further and egregious curtailment thereof.
Between free nations such an authoritative pronouncement would lead to an open rupture.
The Report of the Commission can only spur my non -co-operation spirit to further effort.

Editors’ Note
Arrested at Sabarmati in March, 1922, on a charge of sedition Gandhiji was sentenced
to six years in jail. He had spent two years out of the six in the Yeravda prison house at
Poona when he was stricken with appendicitis necessitating emergency surgery. The
Government decided to release him prematurely. While in jail, Gandhiji dictated to
Indulal Yajnik the major part of Satyagrah a in South Africa , Gandhiji's gripping account
of the campaign conducted by him in that country which had culminated successfully in
the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement and the Indians Relief Act, 1914.
Gandhiji observed in the conclusion to the book:
"When one considers the painful contrast between the happy ending of the
Satyagraha struggle and the present condition of the Indians in South Africa, one
feels for a moment as if all this suffering had gone for nothing, or is inclined to
question the efficac y of Satyagraha as a solvent of the problems of mankind. Let
us here consider this point for a little while. There is a law of nature that a thing
can be retained by the same means by which it has been acquired. A thing
acquired by violence can be retai ned by violence alone, while one acquired by
truth can be retained only by truth.
"The Indians in South Africa, therefore, can ensure their safety today if they
can wield the weapon of Satyagraha. There are no such miraculous properties in
Satyagraha , that a thing acquired by truth could be retained even when truth was
given up. It would not be desirable even if it was possible. If therefore the
position of Indians in South Africa has now suffered deterioration, that argues the
absence of Satyagrahi s among them.
"There is no question here of finding fault with the present generation of South
African Indians, but of merely stating the facts of the case."
The period 1924 -1927 was one of setbacks for the struggle, both in India and in South
Africa.
The "moderate" elements in the Indian National Congress dissociated themselves from
Gandhiji's programme of non -co-operation, while the formidable unity between Hindus
and Muslims forged in the wake of "the Punjab wrong" and "the Khilafat wron g" came
unstuck. Communal riots disfigured the country in various places and Gandhiji
withdrew substantially from political work. But his interest in South African affairs,
however, continued unabated.Gandhiji was informed in February 1924 that a "Class Areas Bill" had been introduced
by the Government of General Smuts in the Union Parliament in Cape Town. To be
applied in all four provinces, it would enable the South African Government to segregate
all domiciled Indians and other Asiatics, both for residence and trade. This was in
flagrant violation of the Smuts -Gandhi Settlement of 1914.
In a statement to the Press on February 14, 1924 -from the hospital where he was
recovering -he stressed the responsibility of the Imperial Governmen t to insist on the
observance of the 1914 agreement. He pointed out that the situation had arisen because of
the "original flaw" in the South African Constitution which denied franchise to Indians
and the natives of the soil, and made the government depend ent solely upon the will of
the Europeans. The Imperial Government which had permitted this was, therefore,
honour bound to prevent untoward results arising from it. (Item 51). In another statement
on March 23, 1924, Gandhiji warned: "Let there be no mista ke that unless India can make
an effort adequate to the situation, the Bill will be carried through..." (Item 56). At the
same time, in a letter to P.K. Naidu, Gandhiji suggested satyagraha by the Indian people
if it becomes necessary. (Item 57). In an interview to Associated Press in April, he
warned again that the Bill's effect "must be to ruin the Indian settlers." (Item 59).
News came in August 1924 that the Natal Boroughs Ordinance, 1924, had deprived
Indians of municipal franchise in Natal. U rging Delhi to act swiftly, Gandhiji wrote in
Young India : "If the Government of India move, for very shame, to protect them (Indians
in South Africa) against impending spoliation, it can do so with effect." (Item 62).
But he told the Indian community that they could expect little help from the Indian
public, except for newspaper articles. The Indian Government set no store by public
opinion in India. But, he added, if they show the spirit of sacrifice as they had shown in
the past, India and the worl d would be with them. (Items 66 -67).
Fortunately, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, a close associate of Gandhiji, was able to visit South
Africa to provide encouragement to the Indian community during this critical time. She
met many leaders of opinion in the cou ntry and suggested a round table conference to
discuss the position of Indians in South Africa.
There was then a short respite as the Smuts Government dissolved the Parliament and
called general elections, but they resulted in a Government led by G eneral Hertzog,
which was even more decidedly anti -Asiatic.
In April 1925, the Secretary of the British Indian Association, Johannesburg, cabled
Gandhiji about a Bill restricting Indian trade to within six miles of the Transvaal
municipal or townshi p areas. Profoundly disturbed, Gandhiji said ( Young India , April 30,
1925):
"If extermination of the Asiatic is the goal, the honest course would be to bring in an
expatriation bill and challenge the Indian Government to do its worst." (Item 71).Amod Bhayat, one of the founding members of the Natal Indian Congress, cabled to
Gandhiji in July 1925 about the introduction in Parliament by the Hertzog Government
of the "Areas Reservation and Immigration and Registration (Further Provisions) Bill,"
which was more draconian than the Class Areas Bill.
Gandhiji declared that this Bill was "an indication of the determination of the Union
Government to starve the Indians out of South Africa." (Item 73). In another
significant comment made in Young India (November 26, 1925), he described the South
African Indian question as "the question of the hour," "a question of life and death" for
the Indians settled in South Africa. (Item 75).
The South African Indian Congress sent a deputation to Indi a, led by Dr. Abdullah
Abdurahman, to seek support from the Government, the Congress and the people in this
grave crisis. They attended the Kanpur Congress session that December. In a resolution,
moved by Gandhiji, the Congress declared:
"The propo sed legislation known as the Areas Reservation and Immigration and
Registration (Further Provisions) Bill is a breach of the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement of
1914 in that it is racial in character and is calculated not only to make the position of
settlers much w orse than it was in 1911 but is designed to make the residence in that
country of any self -respecting Indian impossible... The Congress heartily endorses the
suggestion that a Round Table Conference containing among others proper Indian
representatives sho uld be called to settle the question." (Items 79 -80).
Gandhiji also asked for a withholding of the Royal assent to the Bill. He urged the
Viceroy, Lord Reading, on January 28, 1926, "not merely to secure a postponement of
the consideration of the me asure but to insist upon at least a reversion to the position of
1914." (Item 83).
The Indians in South Africa, he felt, should offer satyagraha if necessary and if they
had the will and courage, but at the proper time. "That time is not yet," he said . "They
must, as they are doing, exhaust every diplomatic remedy..." (Item 88).
The ‘diplomatic remedies’ met with partial success. Prodded, doubtless, by the
Government of India and the Imperial Government, the South African authorities
announced in April 1926 that a Round Table Conference would be called and
consideration of the Bill postponed until then. But while giving in to reason on the Areas
Reservation Bill which was to affect Asiatics, the South African authorities went ahead,
in May 1926 , to pass the Mines and Works Amendment Act (Colour Bar Bill) which
directly and shamelessly discriminated against the non -Europeans, mainly South Africa's
"Native" population. Gandhiji saw the broader significance of this Act. He warned that
"the Europea ns of South Africa if they persist in their arrogant policy will have sown the
seeds of their own destruction." (Item 86).
Deploring the passing of the Colour Bar Bill, Gandhiji issued a statement on May 14,
1926: "One had wished that the spirit of ju stice that actuated the Union Government topostpone the passing of one Bill (Class Areas Bill) would induce them not to force the
passage of the other..." (Item 99). On July 22, 1926, he was more forthright. "I do not
conceive the possibility of justic e being done to Indians if none is rendered to the natives
of the soil. Justice to them is not to be expected if injustice is done to the Natives..."
(Item 105).
And in November 1926, as the Round Table Conference prepared to meet, Gandhiji
cast a lo ng gaze into the future. The Areas Reservation Bill, he said, "may be shelved for
ever but if the spirit animating it survives, the position of the settlers will, in no wise, be
better than if the Bill had been passed." (Item 110).
Yet notwithstanding all his misgivings about the white rulers of South Africa, Gandhiji
wanted the Indian settlers to play fair. He cautioned them against breaches of conduct at
the time of the Round Table Conference. "In order to ensure a peaceful atmosphere at the
Confere nce, all that is necessary is for us not to impute motives, not to exaggerate and not
to use harsh language in discussing subjects..." (Item 101).
When the results of the Cape Town Conference were announced in a joint
communiqué on February 1927, Gan dhiji was persuaded that they represented an
"honourable compromise." "It is not the best that could be conceived," he wrote, "but it is
the best that was possible." (Item 121). The dropping of the Areas Reservation Bill gave
another respite to the Indian community.
But Gandhiji had serious reservations on the provisions on "repatriation" of Indians
from South Africa and on other aspects of the Cape Town agreement. At the next session
of the Congress in Madras, in December 1927, he moved a resolution p roclaiming that
the Congress "cannot be satisfied till the status of the (Indian) settlers is brought on par
with that of the enfranchised inhabitants of the Union..." (Item 133).
51. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS ON ANTI -INDIAN CAMPAIGN
IN SOUTH AFRICA, FEBR UARY 14, 1924155
As one expected to understand the situation created in South Africa by the anti -Asiatic
movement now going on there, and especially the Class Areas Bill now under
consideration by the Union Parliament, I deem it my duty to place my opin ion on the
situation before the public.156
The anti -Asiatic agitation on the part of Europeans in South Africa is no new thing. It is
almost as old as the first settlement of unindentured Indians in South Africa, and is
155This s tatement was published generally in the Indian press.
156The Class Areas Bill sought to deprive the Indians of their right to trade, residence
and ownership of land, and to impose more stringent restrictions on Indian immigration.principally due to trade jealousy on the part of white retail traders. As in other parts of the
world so in South Africa, interested men, if they sufficiently persist, find no difficulty in
gathering the support round them of those who are not so interested, but who do not think
for themselv es. The present agitation, I remember, was begun as early as 1921, and the
Class Areas Bill is, no doubt, one result of that agitation.
Before dealing with the nature and effect of the Bill, it is necessary to point out that it is
in breach of the compro mise of 1914 arrived at between the Union Government and the
Indian community of South Africa. But it was a compromise to which both the Indian
Government and the Imperial Government were as much party as the Union Government
and Indian community, because the compromise was arrived at with the knowledge and
concurrence of the Imperial and the Indian Governments. The latter even sent Sir
Benjamin Robertson as a representative, technically to watch the course of the
Commission that was appointed by the Union Government to inquire into the Indian
position, but in reality to negotiate a settlement. The main terms of the compromise were
settled before Sir Benjamin Robertson, who represented the Indian Government, returned
to India.
In accordance with that compr omise, no further anti -Asiatic legislation was to be passed
by the Union Government. The understanding at the time was that the legal position of
the Indian would be gradually improved and that the then existing anti -Asiatic legislation
would, in time to come, be repealed. The contrary has, however, happened. The public
may remember that the first attempt to break the spirit of the compromise was made
when, in the Transvaal, an attempt was made to enforce the existing legislation adversely
to the Indians a nd contrary to the practice that prevailed at the time of the compromise.
The Class Areas Bill, however, goes much further in restricting Indian liberty.
Whatever may be the other implications of the compromise, this much cannot be disputed
by any party, that the settlement of 1914 pledged the Union Government not to put
further restrictions upon the Indian liberty, and apart from the general powers of
disallowance vested in His Majesty under the Letter of Instructions addressed to the
Governor -General of South Africa, the Imperial Government if they would be true to
their trust are bound, at any cost, to insist upon the observance of the terms of the
compromise referred to by me.
We in India may not ignore the difficulties of the Union Government which is dependent
for its existence solely upon the will of the Europeans of South Africa expressed through
their elected representatives to the exclusion of Indians and the natives of soil. This
unwarranted exclusion is the original flaw in the South African c onstitution, as it is to be
found in the constitutions of most of the self -governing Colonies which have their native
populations and Indian populations. As the Imperial Government permitted the flaw, it is
in honour bound to prevent untoward results arisi ng from it. South Africa and Kenya will
presently show what moral worth there is in the Imperial system. Pressure of public
opinion may, and probably will, bring about temporary relief in both the places; but it
will be only temporary. It can merely postpo ne the final act in the tragedy unless some
unforeseen radical change, either in England or in India, takes place.And now for the Bill itself. Unlike the Natal Municipal Franchise Bill, which happily the
Union Governor -General has in effect vetoed and w hich applied only to Natal, the Class
Areas Bill is designed to apply to all the four provinces. It enables the Government to
segregate all the domiciled Indians and other Asiatics alike for residence and trade. It is,
therefore, an extension, in a modifie d manner, of the location system devised as early as
1885 by the late Transvaal Government.157
Let me say in a few words what the segregation may mean. The Indian Location in
Pretoria, where, in spite of the Law of 1885, not a single Indian has been as yet
compelled to remove, is situated far away from the town itself and entirely outside the
beat of the buyer, whether English, Dutch or Native. The only trade possible in such
locations is trade among themselves. Segregation, therefore, carried out to the ful l means
nothing less than compulsory repatriation without any compensation. It is true that the
Bill appears to preserve to a certain extent the existing rights. But that reservation is of
little consequence to the Indian settlers. I do not wish to burden this note by citing
illustrations from my South African experience to show how such reservations have, in
practice, proved almost useless.
Finally, let it be remembered that, when Indian emigration to South Africa was
unrestricted, the fear of the Europe ans was expressed to be that South Africa might be
swamped by India’s millions. All the South African statesmen then used to say that South
Africa could easily digest a small Indian population and could even give it a liberal
treatment, but that the Europe an settlers could never rest content so long as the possibility
of swamping remained. Now that the so -called fear of swamping has been removed,
practically since 1897, the cry is raised for segregation, and if that is accomplished, the
next step will be co mpulsory repatriation. If the segregated Indians do not voluntarily
retire, the fact is that the more accommodating the European settlers of South Africa find
the Imperial trustees to be, the more grasping they become in their anti -Asiatic demands.

52. LETTER TO A. A. PAUL, MARCH 15, 1924158
Dear Mr. Paul,
...The Indian community of South Africa includes people from all provinces and
represents Hinduism, Islam, Christianity an d Zoroastrianism. There are many South
157Indians and Africans w ere forced to reside in certain areas which were known as
"locations."
158A. A. Paul was General Secretary of the Student Christian Association of India,
Burma and Ceylon, with headquarters in Madras.Africa -born Indians who are Christians and are highly educated and therefore naturally
very sensitive about self -respect. Th restrictive legislation of South Africa applies to them
although South Africa is their home and although the majority of them never expect to
see India at all. It is not known here that rightly or wrongly these young men and women
have adopted European customs, manners, dress, etc., but neither their Christianity nor
their education nor their Eur opeanisation has saved them from the bar sinister. I mention
this fact not to show that they should have a special or separate treatment (they would
themselves object to any such distinction), but to emphasise the fact that the restrictive
legislation in South Africa is predominantly racial in character. The economic aspect
occupies a subordinate position.
The Indian claim is exceedingly simple and reasonable. They have voluntarily
accepted administrative restriction of Indian immigration and, as a ma tter of fact, hardly
any Indian who has not previously resided in South Africa and practically made it his
home is admitted. In exchange for this voluntary self -denial, the domiciled community
claims equality of treatment. This position has been always reg arded by the thoughtful
Europeans of South Africa as eminently reasonable, and in 1914, an agreement was
arrived at between the South African Government and the Indian community to which
both the Imperial and the Indian Governments were party, whereby it w as understood that
no further restrictive legislation should be passed and that the position of the domiciled
Indians would be steadily and progressively ameliorated. The local Indian community,
therefore, has a double grievance in respect of the present a nti-Indian agitation in South
Africa.
The vast majority of Europeans in South Africa are nominally Christian. I have the
privilege of claiming many of them, especially the missionaries, as my life -long friends.
What is wanted is for the real Christian s to dare to stand for truth and justice. There is
unfortunately too much of expedience even amongst some of the best of them. They think
that standing for truth in the face of prejudice will impair their usefulness for service. I
have always dissented fro m this view, and my humble opinion based upon extensive
experience is that such an attitude is a concession, although totally unconscious, to
Satan...
Yours truly,

54. INTERVIEW TO THE TIMES OF INDIA , MARCH 20, 1924
Gandhiji gave an interesting explanation of the South African Government’s decision
to omit the Cape Province from the operation of the Class Areas Bill. He said:
This is merely an instance of selfishness on the part, principally, of the Dutch
population. Nearly all the house -work in the Cape is done by Malay women, and if the
Segregation Act came into force, these Malay women would be affected by it.160This
would mean depriving a major part of the white population of its domestic help, which
would give no end of inconvenience. Consequently, as the Indian population of the Cape
is small -about 10,000 in all -the Cape people decided that they are not w orth worrying
about as far as segregation is concerned in view of the difficulties which segregation
would bring in its train.

GREAT DEMAND ON HER IN INTEREST OF THE CAUSE."164
This is startling news, almost too bad even for South Africa to be believed. I have already
endeavoured to show why the Cape was to be excluded from the operation of the
measure. If the information cabled by Reuter as to the exclusion of the Cape is correct,
there is something wrong in the foregoing cable, or the information contained in it is
applicable to th e other three Provinces only, namely, Orangia, Transvaal and Natal. The
position will be that, so far as the Cape is concerned, the Cape Indians will still remain
162This was published generally in the Indian press. Young India reproduced it under the
title "The Class Areas Bill."

164Mrs. Sarojini Naidu travelled all over South Africa, creating a great impression on all
sections of the population and providing encouragement to the Indians. In the course o f
her tour she suggested a round -table conference to bring about reconciliation between
South Africa and India -and this proposal was endorsed by the South African Indian
Congress which elected her its President that year.
Mrs. Naidu’s tour was also significant for her support for the unity of the
oppressed people in South Africa.exempted from the operation of the measure, whereas in the other Provinces the measure
will a pply only to Indians.
There is no difficulty about understanding the exemptions, because the idea of
segregation of Natives and Malays in the extreme sense is new. Every European
household has Natives of South Africa as domestic servants. Malays, as I ha ve shown in
a previous communication, are a negligible quantity except in the Cape. We have,
therefore, the naked truth before us that the Bill in question is aimed merely at Indians
and that it connotes not only segregation but indirect expulsion.
Mrs. Sarojini Naidu's visit to South Africa and her inspiring presence there will
undoubtedly steel the hearts of the Indian settlers for further effort. Her presence is also
bringing Europeans and Indians on the same platform. Let India, however, not be lulled
into a sense of false security because of the commanding presence of Mrs. Naidu in the
midst of the sorely -tried Indian settlers.
After all, the cultured Europeans of South Africa are gentlemen, and I have little doubt
that Mrs. Naidu is receiving all t he attention that is due to her for her many and matchless
gifts, but the South African Europeans have also a fixed and determined anti -Indian
policy. General Smuts is a finished diplomat. On due occasions he can speak honeyed
words, but he knows his mind, and let there be no mistake that unless India can make an
effort adequate to the situation, the Bill will be carried through the Union Parliament in
spite of Mrs. Naidu's resourcefulness.

Post Andheri,
March 23, 1924
My dear Naidu,165
I was delighted to se e your writing after such a long time.
I am watching the course of events in South Africa with the greatest attention and
anxiety. If any one person can possibly influence the course of events in our favour, it is
certainly Mrs. Naidu166. She has a wond erful charm of manner and is tireless in her duty.
She is staying up to the end of this month and probably longer still. I only hope that if, in

166Mrs. Sarojini Naiduspite of all the efforts, the Class Areas Bill does become law, you will be able to persuade
our people to get upsatyagraha if it becomes necessary. At the same time, I would say,
do not launch it unless you are absolutely certain that you will be able to carry the thing
through. Do please keep me posted with all the particulars, sending me cuttings.
Yours sincerely,

My dear Christopher,167
I was so glad to see your familiar writing after so many years.
I am anxiously and closely watching the events in South Africa and will do all that is
possible for an ailing man to do. I know that the presence of Mrs. Naidu is a source of
great joy and stre ngth to you. Do please keep me well informed of the progress of events,
sending me all the cuttings and other documents that you may think I should see. You
have asked me to send a cablegram about unity amongst our people. I think it will serve
no useful p urpose. Your letter is dated 11th February. It is now 28th of March. All that I
infer from the cablegrams being received about Mrs. Naidu’s progress in South Africa
goes to show that you are presenting a united front. Why should I therefore assume
disunion when everything points to the contrary...
Yours sincerely,

59. INTERVIEW TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA, APRIL
1924168
I have carefully read Mr. Duncan’s speech delivered by him at the second reading
of the Class Areas Bill in the Union Assembly.169I have not before me the letters
167Albert Christopher, who actively participated in the Gre at March of 1913, later
became an advocate and took a lead in forming the South African Indian Congress. He
was a prominent leader of the Indian community for many years.
168The interview was given in Bombay on or before April 6, 1924.
169Patrick Duncan, mem ber of the South African Cabinet; Governor -General in 1927.exchanged between General Smuts and myself.170I have sent for the file of the Indian
Opinion which I have at Satyagraha Ashram , Sabarmati. It contains the te xt of the two
letters, but for my purpose I do not really need them. I am surprised at Mr. Duncan’s
assertion. The two letters do not form the whole of the agreement. It is necessary to
remember that the Indian struggle commenced with the Asiatic Registrat ion Act of 1907,
which was vetoed as an Ordinance and passed, almost word for word, by the first
responsible legislature of the Transvaal. Finally, in 1914, the struggle reached its climax
and embraced all the four provinces of the Union. "Vested rights" h as been a phrase
requiring interpretation from time to time. My contention is that the whole tenor of the
agreement pledged the Union Government not only not to curtail vested rights, but
gradually to remove the restrictions that existed in 1914.
I have already cited Sir Benjamin Robertson and Mr. Andrews as my witnesses in
support of my contention. I have asked Mr. Andrews, who was present at the negotiations
that were going on between General Smuts and myself, and he completely supports
me.171The Indian struggle extending over a long period of eight years could not have
been undertaken so that, after a full and honourable settlement, it was open to the Union
Government to take away the rights already possessed by the Indians.
The whole of Mr. Duncan’s sp eech is a curious exhibition of inconsistency and refusal to
do the right thing. As the speech itself shows, the Class Areas Bill is introduced not
because it is necessary for the conservation of European predominance, but because
interested Europeans are clamouring for it. Mr. Duncan himself admits that the Indian
population is gradually decreasing, because immigration has ceased. His distinction
between segregation and separation is, to say the least, hypocritical. And in spite of his
statement to the con trary, I venture to state that, whatever the idea underlying the Bill
may be, its effect must be to ruin the Indian settlers.

60. MY OFFER
Shrimati Sarojini’s splendid work in South A frica has told. Letters received by me from
South Africa show that her presence has brought fresh courage to the Indian settlers. Mr.
Duncan’s fruitless efforts to justify an unjustifiable measure show also that the Europeans
of South Africa have felt the force of her wonderful work. Mr. Duncan’s assertion that
the agreement of 1914 did not bind the Union Government (not?) to take away vested
rights, as the Class Areas Bill admittedly does, ought to carry with it the understanding
that, if such an agreement can be proved, the Bill will not be proceeded with. Even
though a non -co-operator, I beg to make the proposal that, if the Government of India
170On June 30, 1914
171For the statement of the Reverend C.F. Andrews substantiating the position taken by
Gandhiji, see Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi , Volume 23, Appendix XII.receive an undertaking from the Union Government that, if the agreement can be proved
to the satisfaction of an impartial tribunal, they will suspend the Bill pending such an
enquiry, I shall be prepared to appear before such a tribunal to prove the agreement. Nor
is precedent wanting for such a course. When the interpretation of the Transvaal Law 3 of
1885 and the propriety of its enactment in spite of the London Convention were in
dispute, the matter was referred to arbitration by the Imperial and the Transvaal
Governments.172

61. NOTES ON SOU TH AFRICA
For the present at least the Indians (in South Africa) appear to have been saved from the
sword, hitherto hanging over their heads, in the form of confining their residence to the
scavengers` location. Smt. Sarojini’s efforts appear to have succ eeded in an unexpected
manner. General Smuts has announced his decision to dissolve Parliament and to hold
fresh elections as he felt that public opinion did not back the Union Government of South
Africa. Hence the new Bills which were to be passed by the present Parliament have been
postponed, at least for the present.173But it is not at all likely that members of the new
Parliament will be inclined to do justice to Indians. It will not at all be surprising if their
attitude towards the Indians in South Afr ica is harder even than that of the present
members. Still, we should rest satisfied, for the time being at least, as "he who survives a
crisis may live up to the age of a hundred years."

62. NOTE ON NATAL INDIANS
It is a pathetic cable from the Natal Indians protesting against the passing of the
Ordinance disenfranchising Natal Indians from voting at municipal elections.174This
fight commenced in 1894. It was finally decided in favour of the Indian settlers. The then
Natal Government admitted that it would be most unjust to deprive the Indian taxpayer of
172Please see abov e, footnote under item 25.
173The Smuts Governments did not press the Class Areas Bill, pending the general
election in June 1924. General Smuts was defeated in the elections and a new
Government was formed by General J. B. M. Hertzog, leader of the Nationa list Party
which had advocated expulsion of Indians from South Africa.
174Indians were deprived of the municipal franchise in the Natal by the Natal Boroughs
Ordinance, 1924, and the Natal Township Franchise Ordinance, 1925.the municipal franchise. The Indian settler submitted to the virtual deprivation of the
political franch ise. But no past promises or undertakings bind governments when they
wish to change policies or principles. We have seen this illustrated often enough in the
history of Indians in South Africa. Almost every assurance given to them has been
violated on due occasion. Our bewildered countrymen make a pathetic appeal to the
nation for help. Little do they know that we are powerless to give them real assistance.
Sympathy they have. Newspaper articles they will have, but I fear that beyond that they
are likely t o get very little. If the Government of India move, for very shame, to protect
them against impending spoliation, it can do so with effect. I say "impending," for the
Ordinance requires the sanction of the Governor -General of the Union of South Africa.
Hehas once refused to sanction such an Ordinance. If he exercises his prerogative, he can
save the Indians the insult that the Ordinance implies. Every letter received by me from
South Africa during Mrs. Naidu’s stay there showed the high hopes our people b uilt on
the brilliant mission of Mrs. Naidu. But the South African Europeans can be courteous
and yet carry out their determination, though it may be, as this is, totally unjust. They
have learnt under General Smuts the art of being sweetly unjust. The ult imate remedy lies
with our countrymen themselves.

63. LOSS OF A COMRADE: P. K. NAIDU
We in India know nothing of our South African heroes. They are unknown to
fame like
Some village Hampden that with dauntless breast
The little tyrant of his fields withstood.
I have just received a cable from Johannesburg announcing the death of P. K. Naidu from
pneumonia. He was one of the truest of Indians and the stoutest of hearts. He suffered the
hardships of a prison life many times. His wife followed suit. He was ready for all work.
He got ready on an hour’s notice to take charge of a party of deportees who were
banished by General Smuts to India. He counte d no cost too dear for the sake of his
country’s freedom. His death at the present moment, for our countrymen in South Africa,
is a tremendous loss. He was capable single -handed of hurling defiance against the
mighty South African Government. Indeed only a few weeks ago I had a letter from him
describing his plan of campaign. Alas! cruel Nature had planned otherwise. Naidu is dead;
his work will live for ever. P. K. Naidu was a fair English scholar. He knew Hindi,
Telugu, French and Zulu. He was self -taught . He had a powerful build. He was no mean
pugilist. But he had learnt the secret of non -violence. He was therefore able to control
himself under the gravest provocation. He was a born toiler. He never refused any work.
He was an expert barber and, because he would not become a clerk, he had chosen to be a
barber and carried on a haircutting saloon. When, at Tolstoy Farm, we took to sandalmaking, he became a finished sandal -maker. He was a true soldier. He knew how to obey.
I tender my humble condolences to Mrs. Naidu and our countrymen in South Africa.

65. THE LATE PARSEE RUSTOMJEE
With the passing away of Parsee Rustomjee... India has lost a tru e soldier. So far
as I am concerned, I have lost a true friend. I have come across few men like Parsee
Rustomjee. He had had hardly any education. He knew a little English and his knowledge
of Gujarati was not much. He was not too fond of reading. Right fr om his youth he was in
business. Through sheer hard work he had risen from the status of a common clerk to that
of a big businessman. Despite this, he had a keen common sense and great generosity
and he was so tolerant that, although he was an orthodox Pa rsi, he had the same affection
for Hindus, Muslims and Christians. I have never seen anyone going round for funds
return empty -handed from him. His loyalty to his friends was so staunch that many gave
him their power of attorney. I have seen many prominent Muslim businessmen name
Parsee Rustomjee their representative in preference to their own relations. No poor Parsi
was sent away from Rustomjee’s shop. He was as sparing towards himself as he was
generous towards others. Luxuries had no place in his life. He spent money after great
hesitation on himself and his family. He continued to live in great simplicity till the end.
Parsee Rustomjee’s shop was the only place where Gokhale, Andrews, Sarojini Devi and
such others stayed. The minutest detail did not esc ape his eyes. Who else but he could be
given the responsibility of packing Gokhale’s forty -five packages consisting of
innumerable addresses of welcome and such other things, making a list of these and
loading them on the steamer?
By making a trust in the name of his dearly loved wife Jerbai after her death, he
gave away the larger part of his wealth in charity. He has not pampered his children at all
but has rather brought them up in simplicity and left them an inheritance sufficient only
toprevent them from starving. He has remembered all his relations in making his will.
175This message was given in res ponse to a letter from Ismail Ahmed, who was
proceeding to the Transvaal from Surat.He took part in public affairs with the same degree of precision and firmness described
above. At the time of satyagraha , Parsee Rustomjee was the first among the business men
of Natal who were prepared to sacrifice their all. It was his way not to give up a task once
he had undertaken it, whatever the risks involved. He had to serve a longer sentence in
prison than expected, but this did not frighten him. The struggle conti nued for eight years;
many staunch warriors fell. Rustomjee, however, did not waver. He made his son
Sorabjee also plunge into the struggle.
I first made the acquaintance of this good Indian in 1893. At first I was not greatly
impressed by him. However, as I got more and more involved in public work, I learnt
more and more to value the gemlike qualities in Parsee Rustomjee. He was my client, my
colleague in public work and finally he became my friend. He did not hesitate to come to
me and describe his fau lts like a child. He astounded me by his faith in me. When the
whites attacked me in 1897, Rustomjee's house sheltered me and my sons. The whites
had threatened to burn down his house and property. That threat, however, did not deter
him in the least. He c ontinued the relationship thus built up in Africa till the time of his
death. He continued to send money here too for public work. He was to have come here
in December at the time of the Congress session. God, however, willed otherwise. Sheth
Rustomjee's d eath is a great loss to the Indians in South Africa. Sorabji Adajania passed
away, after that Ahmed Mohamed Cachalia died, some time back P. K. Naidu, and now
Parsee Rustomjee has departed. There are hardly any Indian workers of their calibre left
in South Africa now. As God is the friend of the helpless, He will look after the Indians
in South Africa. But the void created by Parsee Rustomjee's death will never be filled.

66. INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA
The serpentine coil round the Indian settlers of South Africa is daily tightening. Now
in Natal they are deprived even of the municipal franchise. This was said to have been
protected. When the attempt was made to ta ke away from them the political franchise, the
Natal Government declared that they had no design upon the enjoyment by Indians of the
municipal franchise. But no promise made to a weak party is sacred in the estimation of
modern governments. Each party mus t be able to defend its rights by its own inherent
strength. The Government of India’s vaunted trusteeship fails at the critical moment. I
know that the settlers look to us for help and protection. But they should know that they
can have little help from I ndia for the present. She herself is engaged in a life and death
struggle. Years ago the late Sir Phirozeshah176prophesied that India would be of little
help to the Indians overseas, so long as she had not acquired the ability to assert herself.
The late Pe stonji Padsha was even disgusted with me for going to South Africa. He
thought every Indian worker going out of India was so much economic waste. I think his
176Sir Phirozeshah Mehtaclear brain partially failed Mr. Padsha. My residence in South Africa was not an
economic waste of power. But is there not much truth underlying Mr. Padsha’s burning
desire first to secure India’s freedom? Till we have acquired it, we must send our
countrymen across the seas such comfort as newspaper and other sympathy can give
them.
Young India , Dece mber 26, 1924
67. THE VICEREGAL PRONOUNCEMENT
The Viceregal answer to the deputation that waited on His Excellency was
sympathetic but non -committal.177It betrays unnecessary consideration for the difficulties
of the Union Government. It is just for one Government to appreciate the difficulties of
another but the performance might easily be overdone. The Union Government observed
no delicacy when it had to make its choice. The Indian Government has had many an
occasion to make such a choice. Each time, except once, it has surrendered. The
exception was made by Lord Hardinge178who hurled defiance at the Government of
South Africa and ranged himself on the side of Indians in South Africa. There were
reasons for it. The Indians were fighting by d irect action. The method was new. They had
proved their capacity for resistance and suffering and yet they were demonstrably and
wholly non -violent. But at the present moment Indians of South Africa are leaderless.
With Sorabji,179Cachalia,180P. K. Naidu181and now Rustomjee182gone, they do not
know what they should do or can do. There is ample scope for non -violent action. But it
requires thinking out and vigorous working out. That seems hardly possible at the present
moment. I have, however, great hope of one or two young men who are resident in South
Africa. Not the least among them is Sorabjee, the brave son of the brave Rustomjee.
Young Sorabjee is himself a seasoned soldier in satyagraha . He has been to prison. He
organised the wonderful receptions that we re given in Natal to Sarojini Devi. Let our
countrymen in South Africa realise that they must work out their own salvation. Even
heaven helps only those who help themselves. They will find that if they show their
original grit and spirit and sacrifice, the y will have the people of India, the Government
of India and the world helping and fighting for them.
177A deputation led by Sir Dinshaw Petit met the Viceroy on January 25, 1925, to draw
his attention to the disabilities of Indians in South Africa.

182Parsee Rustomjee, a businessmen who served several terms of imprisonment in the
satyagraha . Please see item 65 above.There is a passage in the Viceregal pronouncement which needs supplementing.
His Excellency says,
"it is stated in your address that the mu nicipal franchise was solemnly assured to
Indians by the Natal Government when in 1896 Indians were deprived of the
Parliamentary franchise. But you have not indicated the exact nature of the
assurance. My Government are making the necessary enquiries to v erify the
position."
The statement made by the deputation is substantially correct. It was, however, not in
1896 but probably in 1894 that the assurance was given. I am writing from memory. The
facts are these. It was in 1894 that the first disfranchising Bill was passed by the Natal
Assembly. Whilst it was passing through the Assembly a petition was presented to it on
behalf of Indians wherein it was stated that the Indians enjoyed in India the municipal
and indirectly even the political franchise. Fear w as also expressed that the deprivation of
the political franchise was likely to be a prelude to that of the municipal franchise. It was
in answer to this petition that the late Sir John Robinson, the Premier of Natal, and the
late Mr. Escombe,183the Attorne y-General, gave the assurance that there was no intention
to go further and deprive the Indians of the municipal franchise at a future date. The
disenfranchising Bill was disallowed by the superior Government but another, non -racial
in character, was passe d. The assurance referred to by me was several times repeated by
Mr. Escombe who had charge of all the Bills and who was virtually the dictator of
Natal’s policy whilst he was in office.

68. THE BAR SINISTER
General Smuts has at last spoken out on the proposed extension of the Colour Bar in
South African legislation. The reader will remember the cablegram received sometime
ago that the Union Government was seeking to put the ban o n Asiatics being employed in
the mines. Speaking on and against that legislation General Smuts is reported to have
said:
"In opposing the Colour Bar Bill in the Union Assembly, General Smuts declared
that the Bill sought to give the Government power by re gulation to apportion
work in mines and works between whites on the one hand, and Natives and
Asiatics on the other, which he thought was a very serious matter. He felt that the
Bill was not honest dealing and it was his deliberate opinion that there was o nly
one guarantee of the security of white civilisation, namely, honest justice between
man and man in this country. (Hear, hear!) Turning to the Bill, as it affected
Asiatics, he said that in the days of his negotiation with Mr. Gandhi the position
183Sir Harry Escombe (1838 -1899). Leading advocate in Natal. Premier of Natal in 1897.which the latter took up, and which had been taken up at subsequent conferences
in London, was an appeal not to dishonour Indians. We recognise, said Mr.
Gandhi, there is a difference between you and us and that distinctions must be
made, but don’t cast a stigma on us in the laws of your country, but in this Bill
they were doing the very thing they were asked to avoid. They were gathering on
their heads the hatred of the whole of Asia from one side to the other. In
conclusion, he suggested that the matter should be seriously considered, whether
they should not discharge the order for the second reading of the Bill, and see
whether some way out of the difficulty could not be found."
General Smuts has correctly given the substance of my conversation with him. My po int
was that whilst administrative difference there was bound to be so long as human nature
remained what it was and so long as there was a conflict between European culture and
the Indian, a legal recognition of the difference in the shape of the introduc tion of the Bar
Sinister in the laws of the country was an intolerable burden. The settlement of 1914
chiefly consisted in the vindication of the Indian position. With General Smuts’
opposition we may hope that the Bill will now be dropped.
But let us no t deceive ourselves. The Natal Disfranchising Bill recently passed is an
extension of the "Bar Sinister." General Smuts’ opposition therefore means only a protest
against the bar being introduced even in the matter of employment, not against the bar
altoge ther. However I tender my congratulations to General Smuts on his plain speech at
the risk of still further weakening his political position in his country. We may not be
satisfied till the South African statute -book is purged of all legal inequality as b etween
whites and Asiatics or better still as between white and coloured people.
Young India , March 5, 1925; Collected Works , Volume 26, pages 221 -22
69. SITUATION IN SOUTH AFRICA
"Things are clearly going from bad to worse in South Africa and there i s no
telling where they will end. In two separate measures, which have been put
forward by the Government in power, Asiatics are discriminated against and
classed with Native, as contrasted with the Coloured people. It is somewhat
difficult for those who h ave never been to South Africa to understand clearly
what such discrimination means. What has to be realised is that the great bulk
of the Native population is entirely uneducated. On the other hand, the
Coloured people (i.e., those who have a slight mixtu re of European blood in
their veins) are on the whole a fairly literate community. It appears that the
policy of the new Government, under General Hertzog is to depress still
further the Asiatic and to raise the status of the Coloured people.
"A further m easure is scheduled, whereby South African citizenship will be
confined to the pure white population, which has been born and bred in South
Africa. An Englishman coming out straight from England will not have his
citizenship in South Africa as an inherent right on account of his English birthand origin. He will have to take out naturalisation papers in South Africa.
Leading newspapers in South Africa suggest that a compact has been made
between the Labour Party (which relies chiefly on the British labour v ote) and
the Nationalist Party (which relies chiefly on the Dutch vote) on the
understanding that the Nationalists will support a strong anti -Asiatic policy
provided that the Labourites will support strong burgher policy.
"In addition to this, we have the further news that a new segregation measure,
of even more drastic character than the late Class Areas Bill, is already being
prepared. It will be remembered that the Municipal Franchise Act for Natal,
depriving Indians in future municipal franchise, has n ow been passed and
sanctioned by the Governor -General. If a racial Segregation Act is also
passed, it will be difficult to see what will still remain of the vested rights,
which were to be strictly observed under the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement of
1914.
"In the Transvaal, a picketing system and a boycott of all Indian trade has again
been started. This time, in the present inflamed atmosphere -it has met with some
measure of success. The repatriation of Indians in Natal by means of Government
recruiters is st ill proceeding. I have personally cross -examined those in Madras
who have returned. They have told me that they have been unable to find
employment in India. They are therefore now to be found, after great misery and
privation, entering the emigration depo t for Malaya, asking to be sent out of India
to the rubber plantations of the Federated Malaya States. Truly the whole situation
of Indians in South Africa has reached the lowest point where even stout hearts
may find it difficult to look forward to the fu ture with hope. There is one
redeeming feature, however, which continually meets us in every fresh
information that reaches us in India. The Hindu -Muslim problem out there does
not exist. In face of common suffering Indians are one people -one in heart an d
soul as well as one in Indian birth."184
In view of the foregoing gloomy study of the situation in South Africa, the
remarks of General Smuts quoted last week in these columns derive an added
interest. The picketing referred to by Mr . Andrews is nothing but veiled coercion. If with
all the elaborate precautions it did not remain peaceful everywhere in India in 1921, how
less likely it is to be peaceful in South Africa, only those who know its white population
can realise.
Young India , March 12, 1925; Collected Works , Volume 26, pages 276 -77
70. INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA
General Smuts deserves credit for supporting the cause of the Indians in South
Africa. But this by itself will not remove their hardship. Their pli ght is becoming more
184The foregoing article was contributed by the Reverend C. F. Andrews.and more pitiable. European traders are out to destroy completely the Indians` business,
the very means of their existence. They are, therefore, now ready openly to attack the
trade interests of Indians settled in the Transvaal. India is not in a position to help them.
Government has given up all pretence of decency. It sets no store by public opinion in
this country. No matter what the result of voting in the Legislative Assembly is, the
Government goes its own way. Public opinion in I ndia is of course in favour of their
coun trymen in South Africa. Whatever is possible will cer tainly be done here. But I feel
it my duty to warn the Indians living in South Africa or other foreign coun tries that they
must in the last resort rely on thei r own strength. The saying, "One cannot go to heaven
except by giving up one’s life" fully applies to their situation.

THE ASSEMBLY A BILL PROHIBITING THE GRANT OR RENEWAL OF
TRADING OR BUSINESS LICENCES WITHIN SIX MILES TRANSVAAL
MUNICIPAL OR TOWNSHIP AREA TO ANY ASIATIC WHEREIN HE IS
NOT OWNER OF FIXED PROPERTY, ALSO TO ANY ASIATIC COMPANY
CORPORATE OR OTHERWISE. BILL IF PASSED WILL GROSSLY
VIOLATE SMUTS -GANDHI AGREEMENT RESPECTING VESTED RIGHTS
AND SPELL TOTAL ANNIHILATION AND FINAL EXTERMINATION OF
INDIANS. ASSOCIATION EMPHATICALLY PROTESTS AGAINST ITS
PASSAGE AND URGES YOU ADOPT MEANS FOR ITS WITHDRAWAL. H.
E. THE VICEROY HAS BEEN CABLED."
The cable was received sometime ago but owing to my incessant travelling it has
remained unattended to till n ow. I offer my apologies to the Association. The matter,
however, is not stale nor beyond help. This measure is after the style of what General
Hertzog introduced and which General Smuts so energetically opposed. In appealing to
me, the Association has rel ied on a broken reed. I can but give publicity to the grievance
and hope that the appeal to the Viceroy will not prove fruitless. His Excellency can at
least vindicate the position of Indian settlers overseas if he can do nothing else. The
proposed Bill is a manifest breach of the Smuts -Gandhi agreement of 1914. It is
dishonest to mention Asiatic owners of fixed property in the Transvaal, for it is known to
everyone that they cannot become owners of fixed property except in Locations and that
they are denie d the right of owning fixed property even in Locations. Everyone knows,
moreover, that to confine Asiatic trade to Locations is to kill that trade. If extermination
of the Asiatic is the goal, the honest course would be to bring in an expatriation bill and
challenge the Indian Government to do its worst.Young India , April 30, 1925; Collected Works , Volume 26, page 563
72. PARIAHS OF THE EMPIRE
Lest we forget our status and proper place in the imperial economy, we receive a
constant reminder now fr om England and now from South Africa, or some such place, of
what we are... Mr. Malan, the Union Minister in South Africa, tells us that there shall be
no equality between Europeans and Indians, and that therefore if he will not kill out the
Indian settler , he will squeeze him out of South Africa and will reduce him to such a state
that he cannot even think of equality. The Ghetto is his proper place, and menial labour
his proper sphere of action. We must be, and remain, a suppressed class of the world.
To mention this evil is not to get rid of it... What to do is the question. Pherozeshah
Mehta disapproved even of my going to South Africa. He said that nothing was to be
done in South Africa until we had vindicated our position in India. Lokamanya185said
much the same thing. "Seek ye first Swaraj and everything will be added unto you" was
his refrain. But Swaraj is a result of the sum total of India’s energy. The order of the day
is work from without and work from within. It is a long drawn out agony, bu t there is no
new birth without the necessary pains of labour. We must pass through this inevitable
life-giving, life -sustaining discipline, fiery though it is.
Our countrymen in South Africa must do the very best they can without flinching. If
they have the old spirit of resistance and cohesion in them, and if they think that the
moment has arrived, they must take up the cross of suffering. They must be sole judges of
their fitness and of the psychological moment for taking the plunge. They must kno w that
public opinion of India is with them. But they will also realise that it is an opinion which
is powerless to help them. They must therefore rely upon their own strength and capacity
for enduring hardships and in the innate justice of their cause.

WE RESENT SAME IN A MOST STRENUOUS AND EMPHATIC MANNER.
WE IMPLORE YOU TO PRESS INDIAN GOVERNMENT TO GIVE
IMMEDIATE PUBLIC EXPRESSION TO ITS ATTITUDE AS SUPINENESS
Interior, told the Parliament:
"I must say that the Bill frankly starts from the general supposition that the
Indian, as a race in this country, is an alien element in the population, and that no
solution of this question will be acceptable to the country unless it results in a
very considerable reduction of the Indian population in this country... The method
which this Bill w ill propose will be the application of pressure to supplement...
the inducement which is held out to Indians to leave the country."MAY BE MISUNDERSTOOD BY ALL CONCERNED."
Although it has been published in the press, it can bear repetition here. I have
also received a copy of the Gazette containing the full text of the Bill. It is a long
Bill divided into three chapters, containing 27 sections and a s chedule. It occupies 9
foolscap sides closely printed. I do not print the Bill, as without the aid of previous
enactments with which it deals and which it modifies or repeals, it is not capable of being
understood by the reader. Suffice it to observe here that the cablegram faithfully
summarises the restrictions sought to be imposed by the Bill. It reduces the position of
the resident Indian population to such an extent that, without the Union Government
having to pay any compensation whatsoever, there will be no Indian settlers in South
Africa within a few years’ time. If the provisions of the Bill are applied with enough
stringency, there will be powers given to the administration to freeze out every Indian, no
matter what the step may be, in the land of h is adoption and even of his birth, for the Bill
makes no distinction between Indians born in South Africa and domiciled. The
safeguards provided by the Bill are all illusory and can be rendered perfectly nugatory.
That the Bill has not yet become law is a matter of little comfort. The Bill is an indication
of the determination of the Union Government to starve the Indians out of South Africa.
Mr. Malan has made no secret of it. It is a matter of time when every Indian will have left
South Africa. Let the re ader remember, or know, that the Chinese labourers who were
imported for developing the gold mines of Johannesburg, were summarily repatriated
when the Government had made up its mind. The Chinese had no voice. So it will be
with the Indians unless the Gov ernment of India choose to do its duty. Mr. Bhayat has
made a pathetic appeal to us here. So far as public opinion is concerned, it is unanimously
for the Indian settlers. Unfortunately for them, it is at present ineffective. Such as it is, it
will certain ly be mobilised for the purpose of preventing the impending spoliation of our
countrymen in South Africa in total disregard of the agreement of 1914, which was
designed to guarantee the then existing rights of the Indian residents in South Africa.

74. ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA
The All India Congress Committee has passed a resolution to the effect that
meetings should be held at all places on the 11th of October to extend our mora l support
to the Indians in South Africa in the impending calamity that threatens them. People
belonging to all parties should be invited to these meetings. As there is no difference of
opinion on this matter, we can hope that persons belonging to all part ies will attend. Even
an expression of our feelings will strengthen the spirit of the Indians of South Africa.
These meetings will help the Indian Government if it wishes to do something, and, in any
case, we shall have done our best. I, therefore, hope th at meetings will be held at all
places and that people will attend in large numbers. No one with any political
consciousness can be altogether ignorant of the problem in South Africa.188
188Prayers, meetings, demonstrations and hartals were held all over India on October 11.(From Gujarati)

75. INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA -I
The departure of C.F. Andrews for South Africa, the impending departure of the
Government of India deputation and impending arrival of a deputation to India headed by
Dr. Abdurahman189make the Sout h African question the question of the hour. For the
Indian settlers it is a question of life and death. The Union Government seem to be
determined to put an end to Indian existence in South Africa not by straightforward
means of forcible expulsion but by the dishonest process of squeezing. The proposed
legislation particularly deprives them of all the honourable avenues of earning and by so
doing it seeks to deprive them of every shred of self -respect. The Union Government will
cease to be troubled about t he Indian question when they have ceased to be troubled by
the presence in their midst of self -respecting and independent Indians and have to deal
only with labourers, waiters, cooks and the like. They want a few servants, they do not
want equals, fellow f armers or fellow traders.
The answer therefore returned by the Union Government to the Indian deputation
that waited on them is not surprising.190They have avowed their determination to
1925, with the participation of vari ous political parties.
The Indian Review (October 1925) has the following message by Gandhiji to the
protest meetings:
"Happily the question of British Indians in South Africa is not a party question. India must be
able to avert the calamity tha t threatens to overtake our countrymen in that sub -continent. The
proposed legislation is a manifest breach of the settlement of 1914. My experience of the Indian
question in South Africa is one of a series of breaches of promises and declarations, which h ave
been proved from official records. The proposed legislation is, in effect, the confiscation of almost
every right that British Indians possess. Their sole crime consists in being good traders and not
being Europeans. There can be no compromise in this matter -no repatriation, even when
euphemistically described, as voluntary. Let me, however, say that retaliation will be no remedy,
because there can be no effective retaliation. The only remedy is diplomatic pressure. Lord
Hardinge applied it successfu lly. Will the present Government repeat that performance?"
189Dr. Abdullah Abdurahman (Abdul Rahman), (1870 -1940), a well -known doctor in
Cape Town. He was President of the African Political Organisation, a member of the
Cape Legislative Council and a memb er of the Cape Town municipality for many years.
He played a prominent role in politics, as a leader of the Coloured people, and advocated
the unity of all the oppressed black people.
He was a grandson of a freed slave and was partly of Indian ance stry.
Gandhiji had known him in South Africa.
190A deputation of the South African Indian Congress, led by Advocate James W.
Godfrey, met the Minister of the Interior, Dr. D.F. Malan, on November 16, 1925.proceed with the proposed legislation. They will only co nsider "constructive suggestions"
in details. They have not made up their minds about a round table conference.
I expect a great deal from Mr. Andrews’s presence in South Africa if the settlers
show firmness and cohesion among themselves. The Government of India deputation can
do much if they have instructions not to yield on fundamentals.191No repatriation and no
curtailment, at the very least, of rights existing at the time of the Settlement of 1914. The
proposed legislation is a deprivation of these rights.
Anyone who knows anything of the condition of South Africa knows that there is no real
active opposition on the part of the mass of the European population to the presence of
the Indian settlers. If there was, the overwhelmingly large Eur opean population would
without legislative aid make it impossible for the Indian settler to remain in South Africa.
Nor is the original population of South Africa hostile to the settlers. It is because the
general European and Native population is not only not ill -disposed towards the Indian
settler but willingly and freely deals with him that he can at all live there. The proposed
legislation is an attempt to interfere with the free mercantile intercourse between
Europeans and Natives on the one hand and I ndians on the other. If therefore the
Government of India take up a firm attitude the Union Government’s case must fall to
pieces. The legitimate fear of being swamped by India’s millions having been removed in
1914 the Union Government were in honour boun d to grant and guarantee to the resident
Indian population full rights of inter-migration,192trade and ownership of land...

76. INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA -II
The problem of Indian s in South Africa is attracting increasing public attention, for,
while Mr. Andrews will be soon leaving for South Africa, the emissaries of the
Government would have been able to leave for that country before this appears in print
and, from the other side , the representatives of the Indians there will shortly be here.
Public attention, therefore, is bound to be drawn to this problem.
191A Government of India delegation, led by Sir G. F. Paddison, Labour Commissioner
of Madras, visited South Africa in December 1925 to investigate the economic position
and general condition of the Indians in South Africa. Syed Raza Ali and Sir Devprasad
Sarvadhikari were the other members of the deleg ation and G.S. Bajpai was Secretary.
The delegation appeared before the Select Committee of the South African Parliament
considering the Areas Reservation and Immigration and Registration (Further Provision)
Bill, and requested deferring action on the meas ure until it was considered by a
conference of the representatives of the Governments of South Africa and India.
192Free movement between provinces of South Africa. Indians were not allowed to cross
provincial boundaries without permit and were not allowed to live in the Orange Free
State.A sword is hanging over the heads of the Indian settlers in South Africa. The Government
there does not have the courage t o forcibly expel the Indians in a direct and
straightforward manner, but is planning indirectly to make them leave South Africa by
harassing them. If any of the Indians remain behind, there would be a handful employed
in various capacities, whose presence the whites desire, such as, for instance, the farm
labourers, cooks and bearers. The rest, independent Indians, businessmen and others, who
have a sense of self -respect and cherish it, would not continue to live there even for an
hour under the conditions which Government wishes to create, for under the new Bill it
seeks to deprive these Indians of all their present rights in regard to ownership of land,
trade and interprovincial movement. Indians would have nothing to fear if a judicial
settlement of the p roblem were sought. There will be no need, then, for any emissary
from here to proceed to South Africa or any representative from there to come here. Any
unbiased judge would rule in favour of the Indians, with costs.
However, they wish to follow the law of the sword, of brute force. They do not wish to
respect the principle of equal rights for all, their principle is that might is right. The
British Government will tolerate even injustice perpetrated by the Government of South
Africa; at the most it will plead with the Union Government for a little mitigation of it,
and, if the request is not heeded, it will remain quiet. If South Africa is in the British
Empire, it is through the grace of the whites. While in the case of India even experienced
Englishmen believe that she is held in the Empire by the sword of the latter, and that is on
the whole true. If the whites of South Africa chose they could leave the British Empire
right now. The slaves in India, however much they might like to, cannot leave the Emp ire
without the consent of the British Government. This being the true position, the Indians,
in South Africa, too, can remain there only through the goodwill of the government there.
India, who is herself a prisoner, can give only as much help to the Indi an prisoners in
South Africa as one prisoner can give to another. Under such unhappy conditions, every
Indian must depend on his own determined effort to win his own freedom. Only if the
Indians in South Africa can put forward such an effort, can they act, though slaves, as if
they were free, can they hope to be delivered. How long can one live on the goodwill of
others? Goodwill cannot be assured through documents. Once it vanishes, even
documents which may have been signed are trampled under foot. Neverth eless, India
must do all she can. It is our duty to welcome the representatives from South Africa who
are due to arrive and help them to the best of our ability. To discharge this duty is the
least we can do.
The guests who will be arriving include Dr. Abdurahman, who is a well -known
Malay doctor from Cape Town. He has Indian blood too. The second member is James
Godfrey,193a barrister and son of an Indian Christian school teacher. The third member
is Sorabjee, the brave son of the late Parse e Rustomjee. He is a tried soldier and has been
to prison. Those who have read Satyagraha in South Africa will be familiar with his
name.194I pray that their visit and their efforts may meet with suc cess.

77. DEPUTATION OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN CONGRESS
Here is the full list of the deputation that is coming from South Africa and is due
to reach here on the 12th instant.
1. Dr. Abdurah man
2. Mr. Sorabjee Rustomjee
3.Sjt. B.S. Pather
4.Seth G. Mirza
5.Seth Amod Bhayat
6. Mr. James Godfrey
7.Seth Haji Esmail
8.Sjt. Bhawani Dayal195
Gandhiji had written in Satyagraha in South Africa , Chapter XLVI, in connection with
the strike of Indian workers in 1913:
"One incident deserves to be placed on record. Many labourers came out in Verulam
and would not return in s pite of all the efforts of the authorities. General Lukin was present on the
scene with his soldiers and was about to order his men to open fire. Brave Sorabjee, son of the late
Parsee Rustomjee then hardly 18 years of age, had reached here from Durban. He seized the reins
of the General’s horse and exclaimed, ‘You must not order firing. I undertake to induce my
people peacefully to return to work.’ General Lukin was charmed with the young man’s courage
and gave him time to try his method of love. Sorabje e reasoned with the labourers who came
round and returned to their work. Thus a number of murders were prevented by the presence of
mind, valour and loving kindness of one young man."
195The names of third and fourth delegates are not accurate: they should be "V.S.C.
Pather" and "A.A. Mirza."
V. S. C. Pather was treasurer of the South African Indian Congress.
A. A. Mirza was secretary of the Transvaal British Indian Association.
Amod Bhayat (or Bayat) (1859 -1931), a businessman i n Pietermaritzburg, was a
founding member of the Natal Indian Congress.
Pandit Bhawani Dayal was Vice -President of the Natal Indian Congress. He had
served imprisonment in the Satyagraha of 1913, as did his wife and child. He edited the
Hindi secti on of Indian Opinion for some time in 1914. Writer, editor and public worker,
he became a Sannyasi in 1927 and changed his name to Bhawani Dayal Sannyasi. HeThis is a representative deputation of persons well known in South Africa. They can
speak for the different groups and interests among our countrymen in South Africa. Dr.
Abdurahman, the head of the deputation, is South African born, as for that matter are
some others. The worthy doctor is popularly known as a Malay doctor. But he has Indian
blood in him. The Malays are an integral part of the South African community. They are
without exception Mussalmans . Malay women freely marry Indian Mussalmans . The
unions are happy and the children born of such mixtures are some of them highly
educated. Dr. Abdurahman belongs to that distinguished category. He received his
medical training in Scotland and is a successful practitioner in Cape Town. He was a
member o f the old Cape Legislative Council and also a prominent Corporator. But even
he has not been unexposed to the colour prejudice.
The deputation is assured of a warm welcome and a patient hearing. The question of
Indians overseas is happily not a party ques tion. It is a question on which Anglo -Indian
opinion too has ranged itself on the side of Indians. The cause itself is supremely just.
The question is, therefore, merely of India’s ability to vindicate justice. If the
Government of India remains firm and i s backed by the Imperial Government, the Union
Government cannot but yield to the decisive pressure from the Centre. But there is the
fear of South Africa "cutting the painter." Imperialists alone know the value of keeping
unwilling partners tied up in a k not which may snap under the slightest strain. This
excessive anxiety to hold together forces that are mutually disruptive has degraded
imperial politics to the formula of exploitation of African and Asiatic races, to the
exclusion, if possible, of other E uropean Powers from the spoils of exploitation. Great
Britain’s policy in the matter of the treatment of Indian settlers in the Dominions is an
acid test of her intentions. Will she dare to do the right in spite of the pressure from the
Union Government? T he South African deputation is coming for an answer to that
question.

78. THE SOUTH AFRICAN PUZZLE
The more one reads the papers brought with them by the Indian de putation from
South Africa, the more insoluble the puzzle appears to be. Dr. Malan thinks that his
proposed Bill196does not constitute any violation of the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement of
1914. Mr. James Godfrey who led the deputation that waited on him,197and wh o is now
in India as one of the members of the deputation successfully combated the view. Now
that Agreement finally closed all the questions that were the subject matter of satyagraha
went to prison in the Civil Disobedience Movement in India in 1931.
196Areas Reservation and Immigr ation and Registration (Further Provision) Bill, 1925
197Advocate James Godfrey led the deputation of the South African Indian Congress to
the Minister of the Interior, Dr. D. F. Malan, on November 16, 1925.or passive resistance as it was known at the time. The struggle was int ended to close once
for all the door against legislation based upon racial or colour distinctions. That central
fact was brought out not once but again and again during the six years that the struggle
lasted. A time was reached when both the late General B otha and General Smuts were
ready to concede almost every material point, provided what they called the sentimental
objection against race distinction was waived by the Indian community. From that time,
i.e. from 1908 the struggle chiefly centred round tha t one "sentimental" objection and
General Botha had declared that on that point no South African Government could yield
an inch; and he said that in further prosecuting the struggle the Indian community would
be "kicking against pricks." Surely then it was the essence of the Agreement that no race -
distinction should be made in any legislation affecting the Indian community. Dr.
Malan’s Bill on the other hand breathes through every line of it the racial spirit.
In my humble opinion, therefore, the Bill is a clear breach of that Agreement in this
respect. Moreover, the struggle was one against the imposition of further disabilities upon
Indians. The Settlement was to be an augury of a better future for the Indian community.
It is so stated in the corresponden ce. What could be the meaning of the Settlement?
Where was any security for the Indian residents against further encroachments upon their
status, if new restrictions could be imposed at the sweet will of the government of the day?
Let there be no mistake t hat the Settlement was wrung from an unwilling government
after eight years` hard and prolonged struggle involving sufferings of thousands of
Indians and death of a good few. What could be the value of a settlement which closes
matters in dispute only to r eopen them the very next day? Were the existing laws to be
administered with punctilious regard for existing rights, only to attack the latter with new
laws? Yet such is the meaning of Dr. Malan's contention and interpretation of the
Agreement. There is, h owever, some consolation even in the Minister’s tragic contention
in that he does not repudiate the Settlement, but says this Bill is not a breach of it. One
would therefore suppose that if it could be proved that the Bill was in breach of the
Agreement it would have to go.
What then is to be done when parties to an agreement differ as to its interpretation?
Everybody knows the usual remedy, but let me quote two South African precedents.
There were about the year of 1893 certain matters in dispute between the Government of
the South African (Transvaal) Republic and the British Government regarding the status
of British Indian settlers in the Transvaal. Among these was the question of the
interpretation of Law 3 of 1895. All these matters were referred to a rbitration by mutual
consent, and Chief Justice Melins de Villiers of the then Orange Free State was appointed
sole arbitrator. The second precedent is a question of interpretation of the Treaty of
Vereeniging between the Transvaal Government represented b y General Botha and the
British Government. I think it was the late Sir Henry Campbell -Bannerman who laid
down that the interpretation of the weaker party, i.e., the Transvaal Government, put upon
the Treaty should be accepted, and without arbitration and without further ado General
Botha's interpretation was accepted as against Lord Kitchener's by the British
Government. Will Dr. Malan follow either precedent, or will he say after the style of the
giant in the story of the giant and the dwarf that his cont ention must be always right?Anyway the Indian deputation has a strong case for arbitration, seeing that Dr. Malan
accepts the Settlement of 1914.
In their able statements for the Viceroy they have made out an overwhelming case.
Perhaps naturally they ha ve not discussed the disabilities enumbrated there in terms of
the Settlement of 1914, having been summarily told by Dr. Malan that his proposed
legislation is not in breach of the Agreement. But it is a case not to be easily abandoned.
Theirs is undoubted ly a difficult task. Here is a stubborn Government determined upon
going on with its highly racial legislation. All European parties seem to be in agreement
on this one question. General Smuts, Mr. Andrews tells us, has thrown his weight on the
Government side. It does not surprise me because he has always chosen to sail with the
wind. No statesman has perhaps shown so much contempt for past promises and
declarations as General Smuts -a trait in him which has earned for him the title of "Slim
Janny." But r ight is clearly on the Indian side and if they have also a fixed determination
not to yield an inch of ground on matters of principle, they must win.
Dr. Malan wanted James Godfrey to accept the principle of the measure, and to discuss
matters of detail, to make, what he was pleased to call, constructive proposals. I am glad
to note that he resolutely declined to fall into the trap. The deputation will have all the aid
that India, weak as she is, can give them. They will have the support of all the partie s. Let
them take heart and fight on.

79. SPEECH AT THE SUBJECTS COMMITTEE MEETING AT THE FORTIETH
SESSION OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, KANPUR, DECEMBER 25,
1925
Gandhiji moved:
"The Congress extends its cordial welcome to the South African Indian
Congress deputation and assures the Indian settlers of South Africa of its full
support in their struggle against the consolidated forces which thre aten their very
existence in that sub -continent.
"This Congress is emphatically of the opinion that the proposed legislation known
as the Areas Reservation and Immigration and Registration (Further Provision)
Bill is a breach of the Smuts -Gandhi Agreemen t of 1914 in that it is racial in
character and is calculated not only to make the position of settlers much worse
than it was in 1914, but is designed to make the residence in that country of any
self-respecting Indian impossible. In the opinion of the Co ngress, if the
interpretation of the said Agreement, as put upon it on behalf of the settlers, is not
accepted by the Union Government, it should be decided by reference to
arbitration as was done in 1893 in connection with matters affecting the Indiansettlers of the Transvaal and in matters arising from the administration of Law 3
of 1885.
"The Congress heartily endorses the suggestion that a round table conference
containing among others proper Indian representatives should be called to settle
the ques tion and trusts that the Dominion Government will accept that reasonable
suggestion. In the event of the proposed round table conference and the proposal
regarding arbitration failing, the Congress is of the opinion that the Imperial
Government should with hold Royal assent to the Bill, should it pass through the
Union Parliament."
Gandhiji acknowledged that Pandit Benarsidas was one of the few workers in the cause
of Indians overseas, but said he had been led away by overzeal.198The Congress had
done all i t possibly could in the past. They were not capable of doing much. His
resolution had been drafted after a three hour discussion with the South African
deputation. It told the world the utmost limit to which the Congress could go. As regards
financial hel p, the Imperial Citizenship Association had ample public funds for the
purpose. He himself had supplied funds to Pandit Benarsidas.
As regards the objection of another speaker who had urged the deletion of the
sentence asking the Britis h Government to withhold assent, Gandhiji asked, if they
deleted it, what consolation would it be to South African Indians?... He wished he could
do without it, but they could not. He asked the members of the Committee to believe that
he knew ever y iota of the feeling in South Africa; if he had felt that his visit to South
Africa would be of help he would have gone there.
The resolution was passed by acclamation.

In his Hindi speech on the resolution about the situation in South Africa,
Gandhiji said that the Areas Reservation Bill, if passed into la w, would compel every
198Pandit Benarsidas Chaturvedi, one of the member s, held that the Congress had shown
culpable negligence regarding the plight of Indians overseas. He wanted the various
leaders to organise a big agitation for support and help; otherwise the promise of "full
support" made in the resolution was meaningless . He also deplored the mentality created
among the masses that the cause of Indians abroad could not be helped till they got
swaraj .
Mr. Chaturvedi, a writer and public worker, espoused the cause of Indians overseas,
and received a small grant from the Indian National Congress for his work.Indian with any sense of self -respect to leave South Africa. It was worse than repatriation
inasmuch as it was legalised expulsion without any compensation to be given to those
expelled. It symbolised the determination of the white ra ce to root out the Asiatics from
South Africa. Not even the tallest amongst the Indians -doctors, barristers like Mr. James
Godfrey, one of the members of the deputation who was born and bred up there and who
is visiting India for the first time -were to be suffered to stay there. The resolution
suggested three solutions of the question -arbitration, round table conference and, failing
both, the Government of India asking the Imperial Government to exercise the right of
veto. It asked Indians to stand by their countrymen in the hour of their trial and to render
them full help. If they decided on satyagraha , the Indians should render them all material
help in their power. Fain would he start a satyagraha campaign in India on this
tremendous issue, but the atmosphere was against him. If the Hindus and Mussalmans
could convince him that they were united for a peaceful campaign of satyagraha , if they
could convince him that they had forgotten their differences in the dark hour of the
Hindus and Mussalmans in South Africa, he would readily gird up his loins and get ready
for the fight. Until then, the fight had to be carried on by the Indians over there, and India
had to rest content with rendering them all help in her power.
In order that Dr. Abdu rahman may understand his feelings in the matter, and in
order also that his word of warning may reach the ears of the South African statesmen,
Gandhiji expressed himself at length in English thus:
Shrimati Sarojini Devi199and friends,
I do not know if you have received copies of the resolution that is in my
hand; in that case, I want to spare you the trouble of listening to the resolution and
save some portion of the nation’s time. This is how the resolution reads:200...
This is the resolution which I have not only the greatest pleasure in
submitting to you for approval but I consider it a rare privilege that I am
authorised by Sarojini Devi to place it before you. She has introduced me to you
as a South African. She might have added, "by adoption." Though born in India, I
was adopted by South Africa, and you will discover that when Dr. Rahman, the
leader of the deputation -to which you will extend your cordial welcome -comes
on this platform, he will tell you that Indian s of South Africa claim that they have
given me to you. I accept that claim. It is perfectly true that whatever service I
have been able to render -it may be disservice -to India, comes from South
Africa. If it is disservice it is not their fault, it is through my limitations.
I propose to place before you facts in support of the statement made here that
the Bill, which is hanging like the sword of Damocles over the heads of our
countrymen in South Africa, is designed not merely to he ap greater wrongs
upon their heads, but virtually to expel them from South Africa.
199Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, President of the Congress
200For the text of the resolution, please see the previous item.Lord Reading’s reply
Such is admittedly the meaning of the Bill. It is admitted by the
Europeans of South Africa and it is not denied by the Union Go vernment itself. If
such is the result, you can imagine how keenly the Indians in South Africa must
feel. Imagine for one moment that an Expulsion Bill is to be passed in the next
session of the Assembly, expelling one hundred thousand Indians from India.
What should we do or how should we behave under such a crisis? It is under such
circumstances that you have the deputation in your midst. It comes here for
support from the people of India, from the Congress, from the Viceroy, the
Government of India and t hrough it the Imperial Government itself.
Lord Reading201has given them a long reply, and I wish I could have said
also a satisfactory reply. The reply His excellency has given is as unsatisfactory as
it is long and if that was all the comfort that Lord Reading proposed to give to the
members of the deputa tion, he could have said that in a few words and spared
them, and spared this land, the humiliating spectacle of a great Government
confessing its inability to render proper redress to those who for no fault of their
own and who, as many South African Europeans would admit, for their very
virtues, are now in danger of being expelled from South Africa. To some of them
South Africa is a land of their birth. It was no comfort to those friends of ours, it
is no comfort to us, to be told that the Indian Government has always reserved to
itself the right of making representations to the South African Government -the
right of petitioning. That is to say, a mighty Government, a Government which is
supposed to hold the destiny of 300 million people in the hollow of its hand -that
Government confesses its powerlessness! And why? Because South Africa enjoys
Dominion Status, because South Africa threatens to "cut the painter" if the Indian
and Imperial G overnments intervene in any of the steps that the Government of
South Africa may take.
"Domestic Policy"
Lord Reading has told the deputation that the Indian Government or Imperial
Government may not interfere with the domestic policy of a colo ny enjoying
Dominion Status. What is the meaning of "domestic policy" when that policy is
calculated to bring ruin upon the homes of thousands of Indian settlers domiciled
there, and whom they deny the common rights of humanity? Well, what would be
the cas e if instead of Indians they happened to be Europeans or Englishmen?
Let me quote a precedent. Do you know why the great Boer War took place? It
took place in order to protect the Europeans in South Africa who were domiciled
there, " Uitlanders " as they w ere described by the Transvaal Republican
201Lord Reading (Rufus Daniel Isaacs) (1860 -1935), Viceroy of India, 1921 -26. He
received the South Afr ican deputation on December 19, 1925.Government. The late Mr. Joseph Chamberlain claimed for the British
Government that even though the Transvaal was an independent Government he
declined to admit that this was purely a domestic question. He claimed to protect
the rights of the " Uitlanders " of the Transvaal, and that was why the great Boer
War took place.
Conflict of civilisations
Lord Lansdowne, in justification of the war, said that it made his blood
boil when he thought of the disabilities of Indians in the Transvaal.202He held that
one of the potent causes of the Boer War was the disabilities of Indians in South
Africa, or more accurately Indians of the Transvaal. Where are those declarations
today? Why does not the British Government go to war against the Union
Government when the life, honour and livelihood of one hundred and fifty
thousand Indians are at stake?
Nobody questions the description I have given to you of the effects of this
legislation. Nobody qu estions the ever -growing grievances of the British Indians
in South Africa. If you have seen a beautiful little pamphlet published by Bishop
Fisher who went only a few months ago to South Africa, you will find that there
he gives a summary of the wrongs th at are being heaped upon the South African
Indians.203The Bishop has come to the impartial conclusion that for these wrongs
the Indians are not to blame. It is the jealousy and the insolence of the European
trader that is responsible for these wrongs. He gi ves his testimony that Indians
have deserved better at the hands of Europeans of South Africa. If justice counts,
if Right rules this world, it would be impossible to bring this Bill and unnecessary
for me to waste your precious time and for the deputation to waste their money.
But evidently Right does not count. Might is Right. The Europeans of
South Africa have chosen to heap this wrong upon our countrymen, and for what
purpose? "Conflict of the two civilisations." It is not my expression. I t is that of
General Smuts. He cannot put up with it. Europeans of South Africa consider that
they will be overwhelmed by the East if they allow hordes to pour down into
South Africa from India. But how could we corrupt their civilisation? Is it because
202Lord Lansdowne, the Secretary of State for War and former Viceroy of India, said in
the House of Lords on behalf of the British Government:
"A considerable number of Queen’s Indian subjects are to b e found in the Transvaal and
among the many misdeeds of the South African Republic I do not know that any fills me with
more indignation than its treatment of these Indians."
203Bishop Fisher of Calcutta visited South Africa and several other African terri tories,
and wrote an article in the National Christian Council Review of January 1926 on the
position of Indians in South Africa. He argued against the proposed anti -Asiatic
legislation.
The article was reprinted as a pamphlet.welive as thrifty men and women? Because we are not ashamed to hawk
vegetables and fruits and bring them to the very doors of the South African
farmers? The South African farms are not two or three bighas ,204but hundreds of
acres belonging to one man who is the sole undisputed owner of them. You
understand what great service the Indian hawkers are rendering these South
African, European or Boer farmers. That is the conflict.
Peril of Islam
Someone has said (I do not know where, but onl y recently) that
Europeans in South Africa dread the advent of Islam -Islam that civilised Spain,
Islam that took the torchlight to Morocco and preached to the world the Gospel of
Brotherhood. The Europeans of South Africa dread the advent of Islam, for t hey
are afraid of the fact that if the Native races embrace Islam they may claim
equality with the white races. They may well dread it. If brotherhood is a sin, if it
is equality of Coloured races that they dread, then that dread is well founded. For
I have seen that any Zulu embracing Christianity does not ipso facto come on a
level with all Christians, whilst immediately he embraces Islam, he drinks from
the same cup and eats from the same dish as a Mussalman . That is what they
dread. The thing is they want to become lords of the universe. They want to
appropriate the land for themselves. The Kaiser, though downtrodden, fears an
Asiatic federation and speaks even from his exile that it is a danger which
Europeans should guard themselves against. That is the conflict of civilisations
and that is why Lord Reading is powerless to intervene in their domestic policy.
Such are the tremendous consequences of the struggle which this
resolution describes as unequal and it is in that unequal struggle that this Congress
is called upon to take its due share. I want to make an appeal, if my voice can go
as far as South Africa, to the statesmen that are ruling the destiny of South
African Indians.
The bright side
I have so far given you only the dark side of South African Europeans.
Let me also say that I claim among them some of my most precious friends and I
have enjoyed from individual South African Europeans the greatest kindness and
the greatest hospitality. I claim the privilege of having been a close friend of
that great poetess and philanthropist and that most self -effacing woman -Olive
Schreiner. She was a friend of the Indians equally with the Natives of South
Africa. She knew no distinctions between white and blac k races. She loved the
Indian, the Zulu and the Bantu as her own children. She would prefer to accept
the hospitality of a South African Native in his humble hut. What she gave away
with her right hand her left hand never knew. Such precious men and women have
also been born and bred in South Africa.
204Abigha is equivalen t to two -thirds of an acre.A warning
I can give you many more such names. I claim also to know General Smuts,
though I may not claim to be his friend. He was party to the Agreement on behalf
of his Government with me on behalf of the Indians. He it was who said that the
British Indians in South Africa had deserved that settlement. It was he who said
that that was a final settlement and that Indians should not threaten passive
resistance and that the European settlers in South A frica should allow rest to the
Indian community.
But hardly had I turned my back from South Africa than a series of wrongs began
to be heaped upon them. Where is the plighted word of General Smuts? General
Smuts will go one of these days the same way tha t every human being has to go,
but his words and deeds shall remain after him. He is not a mere individual. He
spoke the right thing in his representative capacity. He claims to be a Christian
and every one of the members of the South African Government ma kes the same
claim. Before they open their Parliament they read the common prayer from the
Bible and a South African divine opens the proceedings with a prayer that goes up
to God, not the God of white men, not the God of the Negro, not of the
Mussalman , not of the Hindu, but the God of all, the God of the Universe.
I say this from my place of position, and knowing my responsibility to its fullest
extent, that they will deny their Bible, they will deny their God, if they hesitate for
one moment, if they f ail to render the elementary justice that is due to the Indians
of South Africa.205

Andrews’ activities
Mr. C.F. Andrews has been incessantly active ever since his arrival in South
Africa. Besides sending cables to the press, he sent regular cablegrams at Kanpur during
the Congress Week. In one of them he says:
"GENERAL SMUTS DECLARED AT THE IMPERIAL CABINET IN 1917
FOLLOWING CONCERNING DOMICILED INDIANS: IF ANY QUESTION
PROVES DIFFICULT OF TREATMENT, WE CAN DISCUSS IT IN A
FRIENDLY WAY, AT THIS COUNCIL CHAMBER OF EMPIRE AND TRY
205The resolution was seconded by Maulana Mohamad Ali and was carried unanimously.TOFIND IN CONSULTATION A SOLUTION AND I AM SURE WE SHALL
EVER FIND IT."
The cable then proceeds,
"SEEING GENERAL SMUTS MADE THIS OFFER, MIGHT IT
JUSTIFY DEMANDING SUSPENSION BILL PENDING IMPERIAL
CONSULTATION?"
Many other th ings will justify suspension and many other remedies too would be
justified to kill the Bill.206But who will do it? Is the Imperial Government willing and
anxious to try all the remedies possible to secure redress of the grave injustice which is
impending? Will the Government of India force the hands of the Imperial Government?
Can we force the hands of the Government of India?
Of the Congress resolution as cabled by Reuter, Mr. Andrews says:
"EVERYONE DELIGHTED CONGRESS ATTITU DE."
In yet another he says Bishop Palmer let him preach before his congregation on the
Indian question and that the impression created was satisfactory.207The same cable also
intimates that the Auxiliary European Committee that was formed at the time of the
passive resistance movement208is being resuscitated. Thus everything that a single
human being can do to prevent the perpetration of the wrong is being done by Mr.
Andrews in far -off South Africa.
Bishop Fisher’s pamphlet
It will be r emembered that Bishop Fisher of the American Mission recently visited
South Africa. He contributed his impressions to the National Chris tian Council Review .
The Associated Press, Calcutta, has published it in pamphlet form at two annas. The
statement is a marvellous condensation of the history of the Indian question in South
Africa. In his preface the Bishop says:
"Its accuracy is vouched for, whilst the unjust humiliations to which Indians are
subjected are understated rather than exaggerated."
I commend this pamphlet to everyone interested in this difficult problem.

208The Committee of European Sympathisers82. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS ON SMUTS -GANDHI
AGREEMENT, JANUARY 21, 1926209
Mr. Andrews sent me a cable inviting me to make a statement on the Smuts -Gandhi
Agreement as it has given rise to a controversy in South Africa. I observe too that two
South African divines have supported my contention.
Let it be remembered that the Agreement is a matter of record. It closed a struggle that
had lasted for close on eight years and covered many intermediate and interlocutory
arrangements and agreements. Let it be also noted that the Government of India was not
unconcerned with the Agreement. It supplemented the Indian Relief measure210that was
almost simultaneously passed. As is common in all such arrangements, the
correspondence between the parties is previously seen and approved by them. So was this
correspondence mutually seen and accepted. My letter to General Smuts refers to
disabilities not covered by the Relief Act and expresses the hope that even those
disabilities which were not then dealt with would be removed in the course of time. It is
not to be supposed that after eight years of solid suffering, the Indian settlers were
satisfied with an arrangement that might lead, not to a further amelioration of their status,
but to their further degradation, ultimately resulting in extinction.
But I do not wish to labour the point. There is the Indian offe r, the Congress offer
to go to arbitration on the point. Let the Government of India ascertain for themselves the
meaning of the Agreement and invite the Union Government to accept the principle of
arbitration.
It is not for the first time th at the South African Ministers have repudiated the
arrangements and promises made by themselves. They repudiated the promise made to
Mr. Gokhale about the £3 tax which, as a point of honour was added to the objects of the
passive resistance struggle and wh ich ultimately the Union Government had to repeal. So
it is the old trick now repeated. It is a matter of honour for India to insist upon the
fulfilment of the Agreement of 1914.

83. THE SOUTH AFRICAN QUESTION
I am sorry to say that Lord Reading’s pronouncement on the acute position that has arisen
in South Africa does not inspire me with hope. He may by some diplomatic stroke secure
postponement of consideration of the Bill during the present session of the Union
209Released by the Associated Press of India from Bombay
210Indians Relief Act, 1914Parliament. But the grim fact that stares us in the face is that, as the recent cablegram
shows, action is being taken already in South Africa as if the Bill had become the law of
the land, and renewals of licences are bein g refused. The principle of the measure is itself
wrong. What appears to me Lord Reading is after is that he will secure some trifling
alteration in the details but nothing in the substance of the Bill, the substance being the
curtailment of the rights of the resident Indian population as they existed at the
Settlement of 1914.
The fulcrum of that Settlement of that long struggle was no more disabilities, but the
steady improvement in the position of the resident population, after the fear of
unrestricted immigration of Indians had been removed for all time. That fear was
removed, not merely in 1914 but when Natal passed its Immigration Law and the Cape
followed suit. There never was a large Indian population in the Transvaal. The Indian
population in the Orange Free State was never anything to speak of. But under a popular
government once you excite feelings you are bound to satisfy them in some shape or
other. All the South African statesmen had excited the feelings of the people, which to be
accurate they themselves shared without having studied the question. The Government
having however allayed the fear by passing a very strict immigration restriction measure,
the resident Indian population had every right to hope that their position would stea dily
improve in process of time. But evidently such was not to be the case and the history
since 1914 is a history of a series of attacks upon the Indian position.
If Lord Reading means to do his duty he has not merely to secure a postponement of
theconsideration of the measure but to insist upon at least a reversion to the position of
1914, bad as even that position would be. Let it not be said when the result of his
negotiations is known that Lord Reading had secured nothing which might be consider ed
substantial relief from the point of view of the settlers themselves.

84. INDEFATIGABLE MR. ANDREWS
Whatever the fate of the anti -Indian measure of the Union Government, there is n o doubt
that Mr. Andrews’s contribution to the solution of the problem will rank as the highest.
His tireless energy, ceaseless watchfulness and gentle persuasive powers have brought us
within hope of success. He himself though despondent in the beginning stages now holds
out hope that the Bill is likely to be shelved at least for this session. He has been enlisting
the sympathy of the clergy and drawing from them emphatic pronouncement against the
measure.211He has been quietly interviewing editors and publ ic men. Thus he has shaken
even South African European opinion that had ranged itself in favour of the measure. His
deep study of the question has enabled him to show to the satisfaction of several leaders
211South African Indians observed February 23, 1926, as a d ay of humiliation and prayer.
At several places, bishops conducted the prayers and expressed sympathy with the cause
of the Indians. P.S. Joshi, The Tyranny of Colour , 1942, page 119.of public opinion in South Africa that the measure is a manifest breach of the Smuts -
Gandhi Agreement. He has also brought together scattered Indian forces to focus
themselves upon attacking the Bill. Mr. Andrews has thus made a very substantial
addition to his many services to India and humanity. No sing le living Englishman has
done so much as Mr. Andrews to sweeten the relations between Englishmen and Indians.
His one hope is to establish an indissoluble bond between the two peoples, a bond based
upon mutual respect and absolute equality. May his dream b e realised.

85. NOTES ON SOUTH AFRICA
Breach of faith
The threatened Asiatic Bill is a breach of the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement regarding the
whole of South Africa, and it is a breach of faith also as regards Natal as brought out by
Mr. Andrews in one of his letters to the press in South Africa and reproduced in Indian
Opinion just to hand. The following is the apposite extract:
"The Natal Government brought out under contract, from the year 1860 onwards, the
vast majority of Indians who landed in South Africa. It was agreed between the two
Governments, before they left India, that if they fulfilled their five years` labour
contract on the sugar plantations they should be given certain rights in Natal,
including those of domicile together with open purchase of land and immovable
property. The Natal Government, in its eagerness to get this indentured Indian labour,
also agreed that Indian traders should be allowed to acco mpany the labourers as free
Indians.
"These Indian labourers purchased those rights at a great cost. For the five years’
indenture was accompanied by such grave moral evils, that it has now been entirely
abandoned as a vicious labour system. The Natal Go vernment, up to quite recent
times, has endeavoured to observe faithfully its side of the contract. Section 148 of
the South Africa Act makes it clear that agreements made by the Natal Colonial
Government devolve upon the Union. ( Year Book , p.74)"
Econom ic Fallacy
The same letter thus disposes of the economic argument often brought against the Indian
settler:
"The Indian question itself is by no means so serious from an economic standpoint as
most people in South Africa have been led to think. Indeed, in reality the solution hasbeen already obtained, because the Indian competition is a diminishing and not an
increasing factor. Yet even in a city like Durban, where Indians are most numerous of
all, the net increase in the value of properties held by In dians between 1921 and 1925
was only in round figures a quarter of a million while that of Europeans was four
millions. Yet the Indian and European populations in Durban and suburbs are in the
proportions of four to five. I have already stated, and would s tate again, that the
census of 1921 showed a European increase of 39.8 percent, while the Indian increase
was only 6.1 percent. Every year Indians in large numbers are leaving the country
never to return. No more are allowed to come in. The Indian men in t he Union are
greater in number than the women. Therefore the birth -rate is not likely to be a high
one. The whole number of Indians in the Union was only 161,000 in 1921. If there
happen to be cases where Indian shops are increasing in number, I have seen with my
own eyes other places where the decrease is equally marked. What cause is there,
then, for any economic fear? The problem is easily able to solve itself, if only time is
allowed; and in the increasing prosperity (which is certain to come with the
improvement of trade) the shortage of labour will everywhere soon be felt and the
majority of Indians, who still do useful and steady industrial and agricultural work,
will all be needed. It seems indeed almost an absurd thing, at such a time, to be
driving such a valuable labour asset out of the country."
Mr. Andrews could have added that in the other parts of South Africa the Indian position
is infinitely worse than in Durban. In the major part of the Union he is landless and is
dependent purely on the g oodwill of his European landlord. His only crime is that besides
being a labourer he dares to engage in trade and eke out an honest living. Dispassionately
examined, the cry against the Asiatic has no foundation save in an insensate colour
prejudice and pe tty trade jealousy.
Young India , February 11, 1926; Collected Works , Volume 30, pages 1 -2
86. ABUSE OF POWER
Protests in India notwithstanding, the Union Parliament has passed the anti -
colour legislation.212This does not so materially affe ct Indian settlers as the natives of the
soil. They and Asiatics are virtually debarred by this legislation from doing any work on
the mines which Europeans can or will do. It is an unnecessary affront put upon Indians.
For there are very few working on th e mines. So far as the Natives are concerned the
legislation not only reduces their legal status but it also affects the material interest of
thousands working on the mines. No wonder General Smuts uttered a grave note of
warning against the legislation an d likened it to a fire -brand thrown in a haystack. The
Bill is a challenge to the Natives. Illiterate though they may be, they are as proud and
sensitive as any people on earth. In their helplessness they may be unable to answer the
challenge but there is no doubt that the Europeans of South Africa if they persist in their
arrogant policy will have sown the seeds of their own destruction. It is stated that the
212The Mines and Works Amendment Act, 1926Senate will reject the measure when it comes before it. It ought to. But the same cable
tells us t hat the existing Government have a majority in the combined Houses which they
propose to use in order to carry out their purpose. If this temper continues, the anti -
Asiatic measure which is agitating India at the present moment is not likely to be
postpone d as Mr. Andrews hopes it will. These measures really hang together and
represent the settled policy of the present Union Government on the question of colour.
Only the strongest attitude on the part of the Government of India can bring about a
reconsidera tion of that policy.

87. INTERVIEW WITH THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEPUTATION, FEBRUARY 14,
1926
Messrs Godfrey, Pather, Mirza and Bhayat of the South African Indian deputation,
arrived in Ahmedabad on February 13, 1926, and saw Gandhiji the next morning at his
Satyagraha Ashram . They discussed with him, for full three hours, the South African
situation.
Gandhiji expressed his firm opinion that salvation was only possible if Indian s in
South Africa had faith in themselves, and a powerful spirit of self -sacrifice. He felt sure
that even South Africa would have to submit to world opinion. Gandhiji expressed his
willingness to go to South Africa if a necessity arose, but reserved to h imself the right to
be the judge of that necessity.
The Hindu , February 15, 1926; Collected Works , Volume 30, page 17
88. THE TOPIC OF THE HOUR
By the time this is before the public the majority of the South African delegation
will be on the waters on their way back to South Africa. Before sailing, Messrs Amod
Bhayat, James Godfrey, Pather and Mirza paid me a visit and discussed the situation as it
is developing from day to day. They expressed themselves satisfied with the splendid
welcome extended to them wherever they went and the support received from all parties
in India not excluding European Associations. But they were not, I am glad to say,
deceived into any false sense of security by the support. They realised that India was
willing but not eq ually able to help.
The Colour Bar Bill is making steady progress. On principle, it is just as bad as
the Asiatic measure and therefore just as open to objection as the latter. Its progress
evidences the Union Government’s intention and dete rmination about the Asiatic Bill. It
is becoming daily clearer that the Union Government intend if possible to stiffen the
measure rather than relax it. The proposed amendment of Section 10 gives no relief worththe name and the inclusion of the Cape has r oused against the Bill even a section of the
South African press so much that one paper goes so far as to insinuate that it is probably
out of spite against Dr. Abdurahman's doings in India that the South African Government
seek to include the Cape in the scope of the Bill. Let us hope that whatever else that
Government may be guilty of, it is not guilty of the littleness ascribed to it. Be that as it
may, there is no doubt about the mind of that Government.
It is this root -and-branch policy that the Ind ian settlers have to face and combat.
They can do so successfully, if they have a strong backing from the Imperial and the
Indian Governments. This they will not have. The Indian Government is a shadow of the
Imperial. The latter is neither feared nor resp ected by the present Union Government. On
the contrary it fears the Union Government lest South Africa may secede from the
Imperial partnership. It is the case of the tail wagging the dog. The Imperial Government
would never assert itself against South Afr ica unless there was fear of losing India. The
apparent collapse of non -co-operation has given the Imperial Government a new hope
about India’s helplessness. At the crucial moment therefore the weight of authority will
be thrown on the side of South Afric a unless the unexpected happens this side of the
Indian Ocean. The ultimate passing of the Bill, even though it may be postponed for the
present session, is thus assured.
What are then our countrymen in South Africa to do? There is nothing in the world li ke
self-help. The world helps those who help themselves. Self -help in this case, as perhaps
in every other, means self -suffering, self -suffering means satyagraha . When their honour
is at stake, when their rights are being taken away, when their livelihood is threatened,
they have the right and it becomes their duty to offer satyagraha . They offered it during
1907 and 1914 and won the support even of the Government of India, indeed the
recognition of the Europeans and the Government of South Africa. They ca n do likewise
again if they have the will and the courage to suffer for the common good.
That time is not yet. They must, as they are doing, exhaust every diplomatic remedy.
They must await the result of the negotiations the Government of India are carry ing on
with the Union Government. And when they have explored and tried every other
available channel and failed to find a way out, the case for satyagraha is complete. Then
it would be cowardice to flinch. And victory is a certainty. No power on earth can make a
person do a thing against his will. Satyagraha is a direct result of the recognition of this
great Law and is independent of numbers participating in it.
Terms of satyagraha are imperative, admitting of no exception. There should be no
violence i n any shape or form. There must be an irreducible minimum -a minimum that
would command itself to any reasonable and impartial judge. We may be justly entitled
to many things but satyagraha is offered for things without which self -respect, or which
is the same thing, honourable existence, is impossible.
They must count the cost. Satyagraha cannot be offered in bravado or as a mere trial. It is
a measure of the depth of one’s feeling. It is therefore offered because it becomes
irresistible. No price is to o dear to pay for it, i.e. truth. Success comes when it is leastexpected. It is undertaken not from a belief in human aid but it is based upon an
unquenchable faith in God and His justice. And God is both gentle and hard. He tries us
through and through t o the last suffering point but he is so gentle as never to test us to the
breaking point.

The Hindu of Madras has the full text of the proposed amendment of the tenth
section of the South African Asiatic Bill. I reproduce below the proposed
amendment and the original section in parallel columns:

A glance even by a lay reader at the original section and the amendment would
clearly show that the amendment is infinitely worse than the original. There is not
therefore even an attem pt at any compromise, but a defiance of Indian opinion, indeed
even of the Government of India. This attitude of the Union Government is in keeping
with the furious agitation which has been engineered against the Asiatics in South Africa.

91. OUR HUMILIATION
Dr. Malan’s proposal and its final acceptance by the Viceroy make up a bitter cup
213Mr. Rustomjee, then in Delh i, had sent the following telegram:
"PANDIT MOTILAL NEHRU, MAULANA MOHAMAD ALI, MRS. SAROJIINI NAIDU

SORABJEE SAVOY HOTEL."of humiliation for the nation. The Union Government has given a Select Committee that
will take evidence on the principle as well as the details of the Asiatic Bill. Dr. Malan has
hedged it in with four conditions: that the Paddison Deputation should be the only party
to give evidence before this Committee on behalf of the Government of India; that there
should be no other deputation, no "agitator" -this is Dr. Malan’s own expression -sent
from India to supplement that evidence; that the Select Committee should report on or
before the 1st of March and that the Bill should be taken up for final disposal during the
present s ession of the Union Parliament.
In my opinion, not one of these conditions could be accepted by a free nation. The
Paddison Deputation went only to collect facts, and not to negotiate. A far more
important deputation would have gone if it had to negotiate and tender evidence. It is
insulting to impose a condition that no other deputation should proceed to South Africa.
It is still more insulting to insinuate that the Government of India could ever send an
agitator to South Africa. The patronising language used by Dr. Malan regarding the
Paddison Deputation only adds injury to insult. The condition that the Select Committee
should report before the 1st of March makes it hardly possible for the Government of
India or the Indian settlers to collect and marshal l all the evidence that can be tendered to
show that the principle of the measure is contrary to the settlement of 1914.
The announcement, side by side with that of the appointment of the Select Committee,
that the Bill is to be proceeded with during the current session of the Union Parliament,
shows that the Union Government has made up its mind regarding what it intends to do
and that the appointment of the Select Committee is merely an eye -wash designed to save
the face of the Government of India and t o hoodwink the world into believing that the
Union Government wishes to do nothing unfair. From this so -called concession of the
Union Government, therefore, I have no hope of any satisfaction for the doomed settlers.
That Government is conscious of its st rength and is bent on using all that strength against
the settlers. It seems clear that the Government of India will accept the finding of the
Select Committee and leave the settlers to their own fate. India in her present state will
probably be able to do nothing more than registering another more strong, emphatic and
unanimous protest against the action of the Union Government. What then will the
settlers do? It is a question that they alone can answer.

92. LETTER TO MRS. SAROJINI NAIDU, MARCH 9, 1926
Dear Mirabai,
I enclose herewith a copy of cable received from Johannesburg.214I telegraphed
214Please see footnote to the next item.the substance to Sorabjee215but I thought you should have the full text. I have replied
"Await decision Committee, Delhi." This reply I have sent in continuation of my
assurance to Sorabjee that I shall not give any advice to the settlers in South Africa
contrary to what the Committee that seems to have been formed there may say or do.
My own opinion however remains unchanged that we are being ourselves in the wrong
by absolutely refusing to give evidence even on the principle of the Bill. I have heard the
objection namely that our people will not be able to stand the fir e of cross -examination
and that there is no Indian of sufficient calibre and experience in South Africa who can
give evidence. The obvious answer is that no Indian need give evidence. As you will see
the Select Committee has asked for a written representat ion which can be prepared and
the Solicitor who may be engaged on our behalf may submit himself for cross -
examination. I know the difficulty of selecting such a Solicitor or Counsel, but it is not an
impossible task. Adam Alexander would not make a bad rep resentative. He is a fairly
conscientious man and his sympathies are with us. It is possible to think of others who
can also give evidence without compromising or selling the community. What I want to
say is that though nothing may come out of the Select C ommittee, we should not leave it
open to them to say that although we were given the opportunity we did not even lead
evidence. Let it not be said that in 1914 I boycotted the Solomon Commission. I did so
for the simple reason that the community had taken the solemn resolution that if the
Government did not widen the terms of the Commission and appoint a representative on
behalf of the community on the Commission it would be boycotted. Hence the adherence
to the resolution. Even so it could be recalled that before even the Commission sat, I had
come to an understanding with General Smuts that the Asiatic Act would be repealed and
that General Smuts would require from the Commission a finding that would enable him
to offer us an honourable settlement. This is a matter partly of record...
Yours sincerely

94. ANDREWS’S AGONY
The reader will like to share with me the following letter from Charlie Andrews, that
noble -hearted Englishman who fights our battles whether in or outside India with a
selflessness and devotion difficult to equal, impossible to surpass, often in the midst of
misunderstanding. We shall probably never know what solace and strength his presence
has meant to our countrymen in South Africa, in their hour of need. Here is his letter
dated Cape Town, 23rd February, without the alteration or removal of a single word:217
"This has been a lon g-drawn agony such as I have never experienced hitherto,
with its rises and falls, its hopes and crushing disappointments. There seemed to
be for a time one of those sudden resolutions when all doors seemed open and it
appeared possible that again there mi ght be a relenting and a realising just as there
was in 1914. I had two very long talks -one with General Hertzog and one with
Malan, both of them extremely earnest and I felt sincere. It even seemed to me
that their fundamental position was shaken and th at there would be at least a long
postponement...
"But now it has all gone back again. The reaction began with the Colour Bar
Bill. Nothing could have been more spiritually degrading than the scenes in
Parliament -each side charging the other with hy pocrisy...
"The scene at the First Reading was significant. Smuts and Smartt and
Drummond Chaplin stayed away. The rest went almost frivolously to a Division -
81 to 10 -the latter merely being a handful of Cape members who have Coloured
voters to ca re for.
"It is a strange South Africa today. All the liberal element which you and I
knew so well in 1914 seems to have vanished...
"Manilal has been working so well and he has been feeling it all the more
deeply than anyone else."
217Only excerpts are reproduced here.I do not share Mr. Andrews’s gloomy forecast, not that I believe in the Imperial
Government or the Government of India doing anything heroic. But I believe in the
ultimate triumph of truth when it is embodied in brave souls and in the ability and
willingness of Ind ian settlers to render a good account of themselves when the supreme
moment comes. They have but to be prepared for voluntary and ennobling suffering in
order to win. Compulsory and degrading suffering is provided for them in the laws
against which they ar e fighting. Theirs is the choice.

95. LETTER TO MRS. SAROJINI NAIDU, MARCH 24, 1926
I had your telegram but no acknowledgement of my letters. You would not want me to
recommend in the pages of Young India which I may not myself approve of. This
proposed collection for South Africa is, in my opinion, a mistake. I cannot understand the
purpose. The fifty thousand rupees granted by the Imperial Citizenship Association surely
ought t o be enough and, necessity being shown, a further grant can be had from the
Association. And as long as there is money in the Association for such purposes as the
South African, I think it is wrong to ask the public to pay anything. Nor in my opinion is
the position in any way changed from what it was at Kanpur218when I gave my opinion
against an all -India collection. I would gladly write if you or Sorabjee can convince me...
Yours,

96. STATEMENT ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN PROBLEM,
APRIL 24, 1926219
The news from South Africa is certainly welcome. It enables Indian settlers to have a
breathing time and upon this happy result all parties, the Union Government, the
Government of In dia and the settlers may congratulate themselves. In my opinion the real
credit belongs to Mr. C. F. Andrews without whose incessant energy, prayerful
watchfulness and detailed study of the situation, combined with rare faith in the cause he
was espousing, this happy result could not have been obtained.
If the Union Government’s proviso is honestly meant, its acceptance by the
Government of India does not much matter. The Union Government is undoubtedly
218At the session of the Indian National Congre ss held at Kanpur in December 1925
219Gandhiji issued this statement to the Associated Press of India on the announcement
regarding acceptance by the Union Government of the offer of the Government of India
for a conference to arrive at an amicable solution of the Indian problem.entitled to safeguard what they call Western stan dard of life by just and legitimate means
and the only just and legitimate means that can be accepted are sanitary and economic
laws. Thus, for instance, Indian lawyers must compete with European lawyers on equal
terms and so far as I am aware no Indian l awyer does otherwise. But I have discovered
that there is discrimination used against them. I believe the Paddison Deputation, which,
in spite of my non -co-operation I am free to confess, has deserved well, made the
discovery that even in the Supreme Court clerks who appear before the Registrar on
business must not be wearers of any but white skin. If that is called safeguarding Western
standards of life by just and legitimate means the proviso is dangerous. But I am an
optimist. I shall take the proviso at its face value and if the Government of India will
insist upon its being strictly interpreted all will be well. I hope that neither the
Government of India nor the public will relax their watchfulness if a final and honourable
settlement is to be secured.
Now that there is to be a conference, India has the right to hope that all questions that
arise out of the Bill will be examined and dealt with in a just manner. The Indian settlers
have nothing to fear from a most searching enquiry into the question and I make bold to
say that at the end of the enquiry it will be found that the only crime that can be proved
against them is that they are Asiatics and have a skin which has all shades of colour.
The economic question was laid at rest when in 1914 a ll fear of unrestricted emigration
from India to South Africa was absolutely laid at rest. The figures produced before the
Select Committee have conclusively proved that the numerical strength of Indian settlers
is on the decrease whereas that of the white settlers is on the increase. There is no
comparison between the insignificant value of Indian holdings and the extraordinary
increase in the value of European holdings. Indian trade licences everywhere are also
dwindling.
If only South African state smen will face facts squarely it will be found that there is
no case against the Indian settlers. But at the present moment I want neither to anticipate
nor to criticise. I have nothing but a feeling of relief and thankfulness. I tender my
congratulations to General Hertzog and Dr. Malan upon their having risen to the occasion.

97. THE GOOD SAMARITAN
I received the following cablegram from the Secretary, South African Indian Congr ess,
Durban, before the decision of the South African Government was known:.
"CONGRESS MEETING ASSEMBLED TO TENDER YOU GRATEFUL
THANKS FOR SENDING MR. ANDREWS TO SOUTH AFRICA, WHO
NOBLY AND STRENUOUSLY WORKED BRINGING GREAT CHANGE
FEELING BOTH COMMUNITIES . MAY HE ENJOY LONG LIFE,
CONTINUE HIS NOBLE WORK CAUSE OF HUMANITY."I have withheld from the public similar cablegrams received during Mr. Andrews’
strenuous tour in South Africa but I felt I could no longer withhold the foregoing
especially in view of the results attained. I am aware that the services of this selfless
Englishman have not been always properly understood. He is no diplomat and therefore
he sends cablegrams faithfully recording his opinion and feelings from day to day. He is
therefore at times despondent, at times optimistic, but if one were patiently to collect all
the cablegrams that he has been sending during the past few months, one could trace in
them all a never -to-be-missed ring of hope when to the sceptic there was no ground for
hope. His last cable to me on the eve of his departure from South Africa told me not to
lose hope because he was hopeful. If he had faith in the righteousness of the Indian cause,
he had faith also in the South African statesmen. Andrews is a humanitarian , pure and
simple, and therefore he trusts everybody. The whole world is free to deceive him and he
would still say "Humanity! With all they faults I love thee still." And this love of his
enables him to surmount all barriers and cut his way straight to th e hearts of people. He
made himself heard in South Africa where, perhaps, others would have been hissed. He
paved the way for the Paddison Deputation.
The mention of the Paddison Deputation enables me to add the testimony I have
received fr om South Africa to the one that Sjt.C. Rajagopalachariar gave in favour of Mr.
Paddison when the deputation left. This is what a correspondent has written from South
Africa:
"He is an Englishman by birth and an Indian in outlook. In fact, I see no
difference between him and Mr. Andrews. It is a surprise that men of his talents
should have risen no higher than the Labour Commissionership of Madras.
Whether his strong Indian sympathies are responsible for this is more than I know
at present."
Allaccounts received by me show that the members of the deputation discharged their
trust faithfully and well. But even this deputation could not have done half as well as they
did, without spade work that was done by Andrews and the incessant toil put by him into
it.

99. STATEMENT ON THE COLOUR BAR BILL, MAY 14, 1926
(Gandhiji who arrived in Bombay on Friday morning was met on the train by an
Associated Press representative who showed him a message from Cape Town that the
Colour Bar Bill had been passed. Gandhiji received the news wit h pain and said:)
I am sorry to learn the news that the Bill has been passed by the joint session of the two
Houses of the Union Parliament. I had hoped with Mr. Andrews that better counsels
would prevail and that the Bill would be rejected. Theoreticall y speaking, this Colour Bar
Bill is worse than the Class Areas Reservation Bill over which there is to be a round table
conference. One had wished that the spirit of justice that actuated the Union Government
to postpone the passing of one Bill would induc e them not to force the passage of the
other. The acrimonious debate that took place over the passage of the Colour Bar Bill
makes one suspicious as to the fate of Class Areas Reservation Bill. The duty of the
Governor -General of South Africa, in my opinio n, is quite clear. His assent to this cruel
Bill should be refused especially in view of the fact that General Smuts, backed, as he
was, by many other South African leaders, put up such a strong opposition against it. The
Colour Bar Bill, if it becomes a l aw of the Union, will set up the whole of the native
population of South Africa against the white settlers. I regard it as an act of suicide on
their part.
Bombay Chronicle , May 15, 1926; Collected Works , Volume 30, pages 445 -46
Gandhiji refers to it, in short, as "Class Areas Reservation Bill" or "Class Areas Bill" as it
was essentially the same as the Class Areas Bill of 1924.100. LETTER TO A. I. K AJEE, MAY 30, 1926
Dear friend,
I have your letter of the 24th April last with all the enclosures mentioned therein. I have
also your cable just received. I have had long talks with Mr. Andrews who is, even as I
am writing this here at the Ashram , living with me. The victory is great but much work
still remains to be done, in fact more than has been done already, because the work
hitherto done was one of necessary destruction; the work of construction must now begin.
You have raised three points in your cable. So far as I can see there will be no direct
participation by the Congress in the Round Table Conference. But the Congress must
have a hearing. The Conference itself, I imagine, will be between the representatives of
the two Governments. But Mr. And rews and others are watching carefully and whatever
can be done will certainly be done. If any step has to be taken on your side, you will be
duly advised.
It is a very good idea to hold the annual Congress in Johannesburg. Your resolutions must
concentr ate on fundamental points to be dealt with by the Conference and should be plain.
Your resolutions should be moderate, firm, brief, telling and to the point.
After the Colour Bar Bill I have expressed myself in the strongest terms. All parties have
alsotaken action. Mr. Andrews has seen the Viceroy but I very much fear that the Bill
itself will receive the Royal assent. What will happen is that at least for the time being it
will not be applied to Indian settlers and may never be applied at any time if w e are
strong, united and moderate.
Yours sincerely,
Collected Works , Volume 30, pages 509 -10
101. THE BAR SINISTER
Lord Birkenhead222has spoken on the Colour Bar Bill of South Africa and he has
blessed it. I hold to my opinion that as a piece of racial legislation it is worse than the
Class Areas Reservation Bill which awaits discussion at the forthcoming Conference. It
may not be put into operation against Asiatics for the time being or at all. It may not be
enforced harshly against the Native population. But the objection against that measure is
based upon a fundamental principle and upon the vast possibilities of mischief it contains.
It is no wonder, therefore, that the Indian settlers are agitated and that Mr. Andrews has
spoken strongly upon it. The settlers must continue their agitation against the Bill with
222Secretary of State for India, 1924 -28vigour and prepare their case for presentation to the Conference. No presentation can
avoid reference to the Colour Bar Bill. F or the one reflects the policy of the other. The
Colour Bar Bill is an indication of the designs of the Union Government in respect of the
Natives and Indian settlers. And the Class Areas Reservation Bill must be examined in
the light of the Government pol icy on the Colour Bar Bill. The postponement of the
former does not mean any change of policy. It may well mean only postponement of the
agony. It is therefore necessary for all who are interested in this thorny question not to
relax vigilance. What has be en done hitherto was work of destruction. The more difficult
task of construction has now begun. Much will depend upon the attitude of the
Government of India. They control the situation if the settlers are weak. When the latter
are strong they can mould their own destiny.
But I am sorry to note that the Hon. Syed Raza Ali considers that there should be
no protest in India against the Colour Bar Bill.223Though he commences his statement by
saying that it is not a legislative measure against In dians "he is forced to admit that the
Union Government will under the Bill have the power to extend such prohibition to our
people if it deems it necessary." Why is he then surprised at Mr. Andrews` opposition?
The Syed Saheb should also know that the Indi an settlers in South Africa are much
agitated over the Bill. In a cable just received, the Secretary of the South African Indian
Congress says: "Trust strong action taken by you on Colour Bar Bill which has not yet
received the Royal assent." Mr. Andrews i s bound to object to this inhuman legislation
which is principally aimed at Natives of South Africa, if he may be expected to raise his
voice on behalf of us Indians. He has merged himself in us as a citizen of the world, not
for any special virtues of our own. But the reason for his intervention is not the point at
issue. The point at issue raised by the Syed Saheb is whether we here should oppose the
Bill or not. Well, we have always opposed it. And there is no burden on us, now that the
Conference is agr eed upon, not to oppose the Bill. There was -could be -no tacit
understanding not to oppose it. We may distinguish, as we have distinguished, between
the two measures. The Colour Bar Bill is not so deadly in its effect against us as the Class
Areas Reser vation Bill. And therefore it was that greater stress was put upon the latter by
the Indian deputation and the public. But the opposition to the former cannot be abated
because the latter has been postponed.
Nor are the honesty and good intentions of Gene ral Hertzog relevant to the
discussion. General Hertzog is not the autocrat of South Africa. He is no permanent head.
He may find himself tomorrow in the same place that General Smuts occupies today. It is
only the written undertaking of the Government tha t can be taken into account, though
we have found to our cost that even written undertakings may be thrown on the scrapheap
when occasion requires the performance. The coming Conference cannot be endangered
because we oppose a measure which it is our duty to oppose. In order to ensure a peaceful
atmosphere at the Conference all that is necessary is for us not to impute motives, not to
exaggerate and not to use harsh language in discussing subjects, however painful they
223Syed Raza Ali, a member of the Paddison deputation, was reported to have told the
press that in its practical effects on Indians, the Colour Bar Bill was not one -hundredth as
dangerous as the Areas Reservation Bill.may be. To go beyond is to surrender t he right of free and just criticism and judgement.
To do so would be to pay a price out of all proportion to the result sought to be achieved.

102. INTERVIEW ON THE COLOUR BAR BILL, JUNE 8, 1926
(Interviewed in Ahmedabad regarding the recent communiqué of the Government of
India on the Colour Bar Bill, Mahatma Gandhi said:)
The assurance given in the communiqué in my opinion takes us no further than
we were before it. The Union Government have indeed repeatedly said that they have no
present intention of extending the scope of the Bill beyond the position that existed prior
to the judgement in Rex v. Hildick Smith .224Opponents of the Bill, however, attack it on
theprinciple that the enabling powers under it go much beyond the position anterior to
the judgement and that it can be made applicable not merely to the natives of the soil but
to Indians also. Nor is it possible to derive any comfort from the fact that when the scope
of the Regulations to be framed thereunder is extended, all parties in the Union will be
enabled to make representations. The Bill does not take away the right of petition, and
one knows by this time the fate of the representations by parties wi thout power to enforce
their will. I wonder if this assurance means that the party without the Union, namely the
Government of India, will have no right of representation.
Bombay Chronicle , June 9, 1926; Collected Works , Volume 30, page 545
103. VALUELE SS ASSURANCE
The Union Government have, the Government of India tell the public in a
communiqué, given the assurance that
"there is no present intention on the part of the Union Government of extending
the regulations beyond the position as it existed prior to the judgement of the
Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court in the case, Rex v. Hildick
Smith , when it was held that certain regulations with reference to mines and works,
which have actually been in force in South Africa si nce 1911 and in certain
provinces for many years before that date, were not valid under the sections of the
Act in terms of which they were promulgated."
The communiqué further states:
"that the Government of India have also bee n assured that should any
224In that case, the Transvaal Provincial Court declared the regulations under the Mines
and Wor ks Act, 1911, invalid.such extension of the scope of these regulations be contemplated in future, every
reasonable opportunity will be given to all parties in the Union interested in the
matter to make representations."
I hold these two assuranc es to be simple camouflage. For the Union Government, in
reply to questions in the Union House of Assembly, have been repeatedly saying the
same thing that they have now told the Government of India, namely, that they had no
present intention of exceeding the scope of the regulations beyond the position that
existed prior to the judgement in question. The sting of the new Bill lies in its enabling
powers. It is like the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of both the Natives of
South Africa and the Ind ian settlers, for, it can be made applicable to the latter precisely
as to the former. The Bill is, therefore, as insulting as it can possibly be made. Only it
does not affect the material interests of the Indians as much as the Class Areas Bill, not
becau se of any goodwill on the part of the Union Government, but because Indians as a
rule do not take to labour, skilled or unskilled, of the kind contemplated under the Colour
Bar Bill. They are better touched materially through their trade and through restri ction of
residential rights. And this is sought to be accomplished by the Class Areas Bill which is
to be considered by the Round Table Conference. The Colour Bar Bill shows the
mentality of the Union Government and as the Times of India correspondent ver y
properly says, in effect the acceptance by the Union Government of the proposal for a
Round Table Conference is a mere courteous gesture. It is not to be interpreted to mean a
change in the Union Government’s angle of vision. And this deduction is furthe r
strengthened by the later information that in adumbrating his Native policy, General
Hertzog has made it clear that, whilst he is prepared to allow limited representation in the
Union Parliament to the Natives and to the Coloured people, he will not allo w any
whatsoever to the Indian. The result which the Times of India correspondent rightly
deduces is that the Indian, in the estimation of General Hertzog, stands infinitely lower
than the Native. In fact, he is to be tolerated till he can be effaced from South Africa as a
necessary evil. The Colour Bar Bill therefore cannot be isolated from the different Acts
of the Union Government. It forms part of its settled policy and furnishes the key to it.
Nor is the second assurance given by the Union Government of the slightest value.
Is it any new right that they have conceded when they say that when the scope of the
regulations is extended every reasonable opportunity will be given to all parties in the
Union, interested in the matter, to make representations e specially when it is known to
them that representations of Indians carry no voting force behind them? And, if the
qualifying phrase in the communiqué means that parties outside the Union, that is, the
Government of India or the Imperial Government will not be allowed even to make
representations, surely the assurance is worse than useless, because, it is a restriction of
which the announcement has been made and not a concession.

104. SOUTH AFRICAN LEGISLATIONIf anything is needed to emphasise the meaning of the warning issued by Mr. Andrews
and myself, here is an extract from a South African letter:
"I feel that through the passage of the Colour Bar Bill the Gov ernment is not
keeping its word with the Indian Government and the community, especially
when on the top of this comes the Natal Provincial Educational Ordinance which,
if passed, will mean the negation of educational rights we have, little as they are
atpresent. In the direction of economics we see joint Councils raised under the
Union Conciliation Act of 1921 in industries like furniture, printing, building etc.
-in which thousands of Indians are involved, without the Indian employees and
employers bein g allowed to become members of the Trade Unions or Masters`
Union who negotiate on behalf of the employees and employers and who go to
make up the joint Councils which prepare the schedules of wages and other
benefits; or, either allowed a voice in the joint Councils. Of course we have no
objection to legislation aimed at bettering the conditions of workers, but at the
same time what we do object to is that it is not fair to Indian employees and
employers that schedules of wages be prepared which they ha ve to abide by in
which they have had no voice, and the effect of it all is the annihilation of both the
Indian employer and employees."
It shows as clearly as day -light which way the wind is blowing. The Class Areas Bill,
because so much opposition w as raised against it, has been postponed but the policy
underlying it is being pursued by the Union Government in a thousand other ways as
instanced by the correspondent. It is impossible therefore to be too watchful about the
way things are shaping in Sou th Africa.

105. THAT ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE
So it has been announced that the forthcoming Conference on the position of
Indians in South Africa is to take place in Cape Town225and that a Commission from
South Africa is likely to visit India in order to study Indian conditions. The Commission
is to include Dr. Malan, the present Secretary for the Interior and Mr. Duncan, an ex -
Secretary.226
This is all to the good.
225After repeated messages by the Government of India, the South African Government
agreed to a round table conference to consider the best means to maintain white
civilisation in South Africa and voluntary repatriation of Indians fro m South Africa.
226Should be "Minister" and "ex -Minister" instead of "Secretary" and "ex -Secretary." For
the composition of the South African Government delegation to India, please see footnote
to item 107.It is good that the Conference is to take place in South Africa. The Union
Government being a wholly responsible government must have in all its undertakings the
backing of public opinion in a sense in which the Indian Government has never felt itself
under the necessity of having. Moreover no public opinion needs to be created in India in
favour of the Indian claim. It is there already. In South Africa, too much cannot be done
to educate European opinion on the absolute justice of the Indian claim. If, th erefore, the
Union Government means well and the selection of Indian representatives is wisely made,
apart from the value of its deliberations, the Conference can be a means of directing
European opinion in the right channel.
It is well also that a Commi ssion from South Africa is to visit India. It will gather
impressions which only a personal visit can make. No amount of reading literature or
meeting representatives can possibly make up for local inspection and seeing the people
themselves face to face.
It is well also that the Commission is to include top men who are supposed to
have studied the question. Our case is so just that the more it is studied, the better it is for
us. We have nothing to lose by the closest examinations and the widest publicit y. The
more South Africans visit us, the better for us. The greatest stumbling -block in the way of
a settlement is the ignorance, on the Indian question, of the best among South Africans.
They merely know the demand of the interested white traders. They kn ow little of the
Indian side. If the Conference results in a serious study of the question, the bogey of an
Indian invasion or even the competition of those Indians who are already settled there
will disappear in a moment.
There is the other side to the picture. General Hertzog’s227speeches are
disturbing. I do not conceive the possibility of justice being done to Indians, if none is
rendered to the natives of the soil. The mentality is the same in respect of Indians as of
the Natives. Indeed, it is much worse regarding Indians. Natives, it is said, have a claim
upon the consideration of the whites; Indians are mere interlopers. Of course, it is
forgotten that Indians were enticed in the first instance to go to South Africa to labour
for the w hites and that they were promised permanent settlement under advantageous
terms. The point, however, just now is not what they were promised, but what is the
mentality of the whites towards the Indian settlers. And it being one of greater hostility
toward s them, justice to them is not to be expected if injustice is done to the Natives. To
reduce it to the lowest terms, the wish to see justice done to the Natives is based upon
selfish considerations. If we go a little deeper, we shall discover that justice can never be
purchased at the expense of another. When the seer prayed "may all people be happy," he
intuitively perceived a scientific truth.

The following letter from the Department Mines and Industries, South Africa, to
the local Indian Congress is the finish to the Colour Bar Bill:
"With reference to your telegram dated the 14th instant addressed to His
Excellency the Governor -General r egarding the Mines and Works Act
Amendment Bill, I am directed to inform you that it is the intention of the
Government in due course to consider the issue of regulations to restore at all
events the status quo as it existed before the Courts declared cer tain regulations
ultra vires . This is necessary in the interests of health and safety.
"There is no present intention of extending the regulations beyond the position
as it existed prior to the Court’s judgement. Should any such extension be
contempla ted in the future every reasonable opportunity will be given to all
parties in the Union interested in the matter to make representations.
"In the circumstances no good purpose would appear to be served by granting
the interview proposed."
It me ans no relief to the community except that no drastic measures are to be
immediately taken. It contains no guarantee that no such steps will be taken in future. On
the contrary, the community has been gently prepared for its enforcement. As I have
remarked before, a bad law is bad, whether it is immediately enforced or hung like the
sword of Damocles over the heads of those affected by it.

I join the chorus of welcome to the South African deputation that is coming on
behalf of the Union Government.229Let us show to them all the goodwill that we are

Act, prohibited Africans and Indians from skilled occupations in the mines involving the
handling of machinery.
229A South African Government delegati on, led by F. W. Beyers, Minister of Mines and
Industry, arrived in India on September 19, 1926. It included: Patrick Duncan, former
Minister of the Interior, A. C. Fordam, J. S. Marwick, G. Reyburn, O. S. Vermoolen, W.

of the Conference that is to be hel d in December. They are coming with no authority for
action. They are coming merely to gain impressions. The solution of the difficult
problem that faces the statesmen of South Africa and India depends upon a multiplicity of
circumstances. The coming of t he deputation is one such circumstance which we must
use in the best manner possible. Let us put the deputation in the position of seeing all the
sides of the picture. In other words, they should be enabled to see the truth, the real truth,
and nothing but the truth. The case for the Indian settlers in South Africa rests upon
purest justice. An impartial study of the question therefore on the part of the South
African statesmen that are coming can only do the cause good.

The Ashram,
Sabarmati,
September 24, 1926
Bhaishri Lakshmidas,
I have to reply to two letters from you, one about the boycott of British goods and
the other concerning the deputation from South Afri ca...
We are the people who wanted representatives from South Africa to visit this
country. The Indian residents in South Africa also wanted that we should extend a
welcome even to an enemy if we have invited him to our tent. The Conference h as been
arranged because of the agitation here, and these gentlemen are here in connection with it.
It is our clear duty to extend a welcome to them. By doing so, we strengthen our position
so that we should be able to tell them what we feel about their la ws. We cannot refuse to
have anything to do with them by arguing that they have been invited here only by the
Government and that we have nothing to do in the matter. We can certainly advance such
an argument against anything done in defiance of public opi nion. I was, therefore,
surprised to read your letter...

That restless great soul, Charlie Andrews, is never so happy as when he is
wandering in sea rch of God, i.e., humane service... He came to Sabarmati before
proceeding to South Africa. He was not well. He got worse. But he will not cancel
his passage. He was better, having rested under the hospitable roof of Sjt.Ambalal
Sarabhai.230And no w, though he is not strong enough, he is on his way to South Africa...
He is sensitive. He feels the criticism gently conveyed to him by well -meaning
friends that he should have been in India whilst the Union deputation was here and the
Indian settlers w ould not need him so long before the time of the Round Table
Conference. He has allowed himself just to answer the criticism in his "The Search for
God."231He was not wanted by the deputation. Its hands are full. As a matter of fact, the
deputation does not want to be coached. It does not want to collect evidence officially. It
has come to gather impressions without being told. It is enough if the members have
come with an open mind. We have no reason to think otherwise. They must be left
undisturbed save by their own consciences. And conscience acts best when unprompted.
It is put upon its mettle.
Mr. Andrews is wanted in South Africa and that now. Because the settlers
immediately need a helper. Reuter has told us they were in consternation when they heard
of his illness. He is their chief, if not their only hope. They must prepare their case. They
need all the time that is now left for that preparation. They need him for this.
He must prepare the atmosphere that is required for the Conference. He is the
only living link between the whites and the Indians. The Conference can do nothing, if
the South African public opinion is intensely hostile to Indians. South African public
opinion is not like ours. It has force behind it. It has votes that count. It can d ictate
policies. It can defy Downing Street. Mr. Andrews can to some extent cultivate and
mould that opinion. His very presence disarms criticism and silences opposition. His
place at the present moment is undoubtedly in South Africa.
230Millowner and businessman in Ahmedabad
231In that article, the Reverend C.F. Andrews wrote of his impending journey to South
Africa:
"There have been ma ny voices of discouragement of late, stating -what seems almost evident
on the surface -that journeys to South Africa are useless, while the colour bar remains so firmly
established, while the daily treatment of Indians in the streets, in the railway tra ins and in constant
social ways, marks them out as an inferior and subject race. All this I know full well from a bitter
and intimate experience. Nevertheless, in face of an Asiatic Bill, which has only been suspended,
not withdrawn, I have confidence and hope. For God is there, keeping his high Festival in human
hearts, quickening love in them among the Dutch and English, even as He is doing here among
ourselves; and surely He will meet me there as the companion..."And the deliberatio ns of the Conference will affect not only the future of settlers
in South Africa but they will indirectly influence the Asiatic policy of the other
Dominions and Colonies. But the settlers must not deceive themselves. Mr. Andrews'
powerful intervention is indispensable for their cause. But the ultimate success must
depend upon themselves. There is no help in the world like self -help. They must be firm
but moderate in their demands; they must speak with one voice; they must act like one
man; they must not sw erve an inch from truth; they must discharge their part of the
contract, i.e., they must conform strictly to all sanitary and building regulations and lastly
they must be prepared in a body to suffer for their cause. There is no salvation without
suffering .

110. PRECARIOUS CONDITION IN SOUTH AFRICA
The latest mail from South Africa has brought me a batch of papers which show the
precarious condition of the Indian settlers in tha t sub -continent. Trade licences are an
eternal problem. The administrative reins are being daily tightened. Hitherto, in Natal, it
has been a fairly recognised rule not to touch old licences under the wide discretionary
powers given to licensing officers e xcept for cases of grave insanitation or breach of
conditions imposed by the officers. But that sound rule is gradually being disregarded and
even renewals are being arbitrarily refused. The case sent to me is pathetic and refers to
an old lady, Mrs. Sophi a Bhayla. The Secretary of the South African Indian Congress in
introducing the case says:
"This poor lady with five children has been ruined through the caprice of the
licensing officer and to avoid being put in jail by her creditors, it is highly likel y that
she will have to seek the protection of the law of insolvency."
The judges of the appellate courts showed their sympathy for the poor woman but
declared themselves powerless, being bound under the statute not to interfere with the
discretion veste d by the legislature in the licensing officers, except when they can be
proved to have been bribed or incapable of exercising the powers vested in them. Here is
what the principal judgement says:
"The licensing officer refused her licence after she had h eld it for many years and it
would appear that the refusal is based on the ground that this lady had not paid the
dues which it is said she should have paid to the Town Council of Estcourt. At first
sight it would appear that that was somewhat harsh for th e licensing officer, who
happens to be town clerk and town treasurer and holds other offices as well, that
because of the knowledge that he had as town treasurer and town clerk, he should say
as licensing officer: Well, you had trouble with my employers, t he Town Council, and
you have not paid your rates or the dues which are payable and, therefore, I will not
grant you a renewal of this licence. That does appear to one’s mind to be inequitable.If this lady had committed an offence against the bye -laws, th ere was a ready remedy
for that by prosecuting her or by proceeding against her according to the law if she
had broken any contract."
Thus, the judges though willing were unable to redress a manifest wrong. When a law is
bad, a judge is helpless unless h e resigns. Such heroic action is not to be expected in
these days.
But the Government is not powerless. Town Councils, composed as they are of rival
traders, are not to be expected to do justice. They will generally use the powers given to
them for crush ing their rivals, but the central administration can certainly render aid in
such glaring cases. The Round Table Conference will be a mockery, if even cases of
manifest hardship remain unredressed. The Class Areas Bill may be shelved for ever but
if the sp irit animating it survives, the position of the settlers will in no wise be better than
if the Bill had been passed. An empty victory will be worse than a proper defeat. For in
the noise of it, the cry of the anguish of the sufferers may be hushed and they may be
denied even the solace of sympathy.
Young India , November 4, 1926; Collected Works , Volume 31, pages 551 -52
111. THE SOUTH AFRICAN SITUATION
Here are extracts from a letter from Mr. Andrews after his arrival in Durban:
"It is good to get here again, and though it has been a difficult time on the
voyage, I am so thankful that I came on and did not delay longer. There are any
amount of things here to be settled and other things to put straight before the
delegation arrives, and it will take every moment of my time to get through.
"Today I have had the warmest possible welcome and Rawat’s
Bioscope was crowded this evening at the ‘welcome.’ I am staying with Sorabjee
at 19, First Avenue. The hous e at 110, Field Street, is all pulled down and
site sold to Europeans!
"The days have been crowded to the full and it is almost impossible to
avoid it as I had expected. There was a very serious smallpox outbreak in the
India n quarters and every single smallpox case was that of an Indian. The
mortality was as high as 25 percent and it was of a very virulent type. There were
vicious letters in the press abusing the Indians for insanitary habits, etc. The one
thing to do was wha t you did in Johannesburg232and after getting vaccinated
myself (without which I could have done nothing at all), I got the Medical Officer
to let me visit the Indians who were kept in quarantine daily, and did everything I
could do pacify them. Also we met and formed an Indian Health Committee and
232During the plague epidemic in the Indi an location of Johannesburg in March 1904decided to work under the doctor’s orders and he has already set us to work. At
once, as soon as this was announced the whole tone of the press changed and we
have been praised where before we were being blamed. A ltogether it is going to
work out for the best.
"I have had time now to consider things fully and get hold of the situation. There
is no doubt that if we can get the best public opinion on our side in the next few
weeks, we shall get a good press and mate rially help the Conference by creating a
favourable atmosphere beforehand. It has been rather difficult to persuade them
not to have a big demonstration just at the time of the Conference, thinking it
would ‘impress’ them. I have been explaining to them th at some good solid work
(like) clearing out the dirt from insanitary quarters would ‘impress’ far more than
all the demonstrations and speeches in the world.
"At the same time, the last thing I would wish is that things should go to the other
extreme and get slack and lazy and indifferent. What is needed is to direct the
excitement and energy into a right channel. I have consulted the best Europeans
who are sympathetic and they all say that the hartal and Day of Prayer which we
held about a year ago was e xtraordinarily impressive in the right sense of the
word and no one felt it to be provocative. They felt that Indians were doing the
right thing in their own way and doing it well."
The reference to the sale of the property in Field Street revives oldest memories.
It was one of the oldest properties of which a long lease was purchased by the late Haji
Aboobakr Amod -one of the earliest Indian merchants to settle in South Africa. The
property was sublet to the late Parsee Rustomjee who had possession of i t till his death. It
was more a public place than a private store -most informal Indian gatherings were held
there. It was the place where the most important decisions were taken. It was there that
Gokhale used to pass much of his day time. It was there t hat Andrews worked. It
sheltered the rich and the poor. It had become a real dharmsala . On the expiry of the
lease the Durban Town Council knew the (to the Indians) sacred character of the place,
but the knowledge could not save the property from passing i nto European hands. Hence
the reference to it by Mr. Andrews and the note of exclamation.
His presence there at this juncture is indeed a good godsend. The unfortunate
outbreak of smallpox might easily have created a panic both among Europeans and
Indian s. The former might have taken dangerously drastic measures and the latter might
have become paralysed with fear. The prompt measures taken by Mr. Andrews averted
what might have developed into a calamity.
That godly man’s presence is likely to turn the scales in favour of the settlers. And
though not much may be expected of the Conference, he is certainly creating the proper
atmosphere for a calm and just consideration of the intricate problem.
Sir Mohamed Habibullah’s deputation has a hea vy responsibility on itsshoulders.233It has the solid backing of unanimous public opinion. Let us hope for the
best.

My de ar Charlie,
I have just got your cable about prayer day.234I am forwarding it to Sarojini235
and writing a strong backing leader in Young India . The whole Ashram will join you that
day in your prayers. I hope to be that day in Wardha. I shall be with you in spirit that day
though the body will be there with Vinoba236and Jamnalalji.237
Shastri238was here yesterday. We had a long and quiet chat.
Please remember there can be no response from our side to any scheme of
repatriation, volun tary or otherwise. We are bound to look after all returned immigrants.
But that can be no part of any scheme. Any such agreement will immediately make
repatriation compulsory in substance though not in law.
I hope you are getting Young India regularly. I do deal with S. A. matters almost
in every issue. The coming number will deal with Colonial -born Indians. It is an appeal
to them not to ask for any differential treatment.
Hope you are keeping good health...
With l ove,
233The Round Table Conference on the Indian question in South Africa was held in Cape
Town from December 17, 1926, to January 13, 1927. The Indian delegation to the
Conference was led by Sir Mohamed Habibullah, memb er of the Viceroy’s Executive
Council, and included: Sir Pheroze Sethna, Sir d’Arcy Lindsay, Sir G. F. Paddison, Rt.
Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, Rt. Hon. G. L. Cobbett, and Sir G. S. Bajpai.
234The Reverend C.F. Andrews suggested that December 19, the Su nday following the
arrival of the Government of India delegation in South Africa for the Round Table
Conference, be observed as a day of prayer. The day was observed both in India and in
South Africa. In South Africa, under the leadership of the Deans of C ape Town and
Johannesburg, many Anglicans joined the Indians in prayer. Dr. da Plessis of
Stellenbosch University issued a call to the Afrikaner people to observe the day.

113. COLONIAL -BORN INDIANS239
I have received a letter on behalf of colonial -born Indians o f South Africa
chiding me for "absolutely forgetting them." The letter says:
"Our only desire is that we should receive only one message from you.
I am sure you will not refuse this our last request to you."
I appreciate the affection un derlying this rebuke. There is a strong tie binding the
colonial -born Indians to me. But there was no special message that I could think of
sending to them. The majority of my messages are sent through the weeklies that I am
editing. And the pages of Young India and Gujarati and Hindi Navajivan are full of
messages to the settlers and their descendants in South Africa. Though I do attend to a
great deal of private correspondence, force of circumstances has obliged me to restrict it
to its utmost limit and t reat these weeklies as a vehicle for correspondence. These
weeklies, as a friend once reminded me, are not newspapers but view -papers, for the
transmission of my views such as they are. They have also received messages through C.
F. Andrews. But these frie nds want me to send them a special message through the Rt.
Hon. Srinivasa Sastri. I know what this request means. The letter reminds me of the days
when Gokhale was in South Africa. The colonial -born Indians knew my connection with
Gokhale and they rightly expect me to use Srinivasa Sastri as a vehicle for all my
thoughts and sentiments. Colonial -born Indians and other friends in South Africa will
certainly have their heart’s content through Srinivasa Sastri.
I am writing these notes before meeting h im. We shall have discussed the whole of the
South African question not only in its relationship to the things that the Union
Government can or cannot do, but also to the things that the Indians, including the
colonial -born, can and cannot do. But one thin g I would say to the latter publicly.
Let them beware of the tendency to cut themselves away from the settlers who were
not born there and of asking for special privileges by reason of their own South African
birth. Let them remember that they are, a nd remain, Indians in every sense of the term in
spite of their South African birth and that, therefore, their duty is to throw in their lot
completely with the former and work with them in every possible way. They will, by so
doing, serve themselves and t he country. Let them remember the work that they did so
selflessly and bravely as members of the Stretcher Bearer Corps in 1899 during the Boer
War and during the protracted satyagraha struggle between 1906 and 1914. Never was
239Indians born in South Africa were known as "colonial -born Indians."there then a whisper of thei r cutting themselves adrift or asking for special privileges.
They have a great future before them if they will seize the occasion. They can become a
living link between South Africa and India, if they will but represent the best of India and
assimilate th e best of the Western civilisation that they come in contact with and as it is
represented there by the best Englishmen and the best Boers.

114. A DAY OF PRAYER
C. F. Andrews has sent me the following characteristic cablegram:
"EXECUTIVE DECIDED OBSERVE DECEMBER NINETEENTH DAY
PRAYER FORTHCOMING CONFERENCE. CHURCHES CO -OPERATING.
AFTER WIDEST CONSULTING BEST EUROPEAN SENTIMENT FEEL
STEP LIKELY MUCH APPRECIATED. ADVISE SAROJINI."240
He is an intensely godly man and, therefore, a man of prayer. His politics are
guided, coloured and ennobled by his prayers. Prayer with him is no empty formula. It is
with him intense and incessant communion with God and waiting upon Him for guidance
in his daily work, great and small. No work that is done in His name and dedicated to
Him is small. All work when so done assumes equal merit. A scavenger who works in
His service shares equal distinction with a king who uses his gif ts in His name and as a
mere trustee. Unlike as among us very imperfect beings, in His durbar the motive rather
than the act itself decides its quality. We infer the intention from the act. He, knowing the
intention as much as the act, judges the act accor ding to the intention.
And Andrews, because his intentions are the purest possible, believes that God
will ensure his success. He has every reason for his belief. For he has hitherto succeeded
where others have failed. No one knows the history of Andrews' many unseen services.
Those the public see are by no means the most significant or fruitful, not to mention
contemporary events. Who knows, for instance, how he influenced the many beneficial
decisions of Lord Hardinge? Truly with him "left hand knoweth n ot what the right hand
doeth."
This good man has made his own this South African matter to which he was first
appointed by Gokhale. He thinks and prays about it intensely. He had prepared me by a
previous letter for the cable I have given to the public. He has infected the Indians with
his belief in prayer. I know them all and I must own that many have accepted his advice
purely as a matter of form or to please him or to make political capital out of the event.
240The executive of the South Africa n Indian Congress decided to observe December 19,
1926, as a day of prayer, to coincide with the Round Table Conference.
The Reverend Andrews suggested advising Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, President of the
Indian National Congress and former Preside nt of the South African Indian Congress.But I know that there are some who have endo rsed his proposition with absolute sincerity.
The sincerity of the few will cover the insincerity or the indifference of the many.
The Dutch element of South Africa is religious according to its own lights. In
South Africa, therefore, in times of famines or locust visitations, there are days officially
appointed for humiliation and prayer. It is then no wonder that Andrews has found the
best European sentiment ranging itself round a proposal which has its seat, not in his
brain but in his heart. But he is not easily satisfied. He wants an adequate response from
India and her public bodies. He wants no resolutions, he does not ask for money, he
wants a melting of our hearts. He wants us, if we will, to look Godward. He wants us to
seek help from God.
Andr ews has become an Indian because he is an Englishman. He wants to rule not
by force but by love. And love ever identifies itself with the loved one. He believes that
the reputation of European humanity is at stake in South Africa. So much tribulation has
been suffered in South Africa that in his opinion, the future of the relations between
Asiatic and Coloured races and the European will largely depend upon the deliberations
of the forthcoming Conference, which is mainly a result of his efforts. He wants di vine
blessings on these deliberations and asks our co -operation (in) invoking them. Let no one
ask what is prayer and where and who is God. Both prayer and belief in God are
supremely acts of faith. Let those, therefore, who have that faith respond to the appeal of
this English Indian.
Prayer is a result of realisation of our helplessness and our final reliance upon God to the
exclusion of all else. We are surely conscious of our helplessness. On the eve of his
departure, the Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri has called the Indian cause which he is going to
espouse a "desperate cause." Let us then pray on the 19th if we have faith in God. All
Hindus, Mussalmans , Christians, Parsis, Jews and others can join if they will. Though we
may know Him by a thousand names, H e is one and the same to us all.

115. THE SOUTH AFRICAN SITUATION
Mr. Andrews cables as follows from Pretoria:
"PRAYER DAY ENDORSED BY DUTCH CHURCH NINETEENTH.
HERTZ OG RECEIVES DELEGATES241SEVENTEENTH. THEN RETIRES.
FIRST SESSION TWENTIETH."
The endorsement of the prayer day by the Dutch Reformed Church is a great step
towards securing an atmosphere favouring a just solution of the difficult question. The
Dutch Church is a most conservative body in South Africa. It has rarely taken a broad
view of the Indian or the general colour question as it is called in South Africa. The
241Delegates to the Round Table Conferencereception that is to take place on the seventeenth by General Hertzog of the delegates to
the C onference is a step in recognition of the tremendous importance of the Conference
and of the issues that are to be discussed by the Conference.
I hope that the Indian public will back wholeheartedly the noble effort of this
single -minded Englishman. One may thoughtlessly say that it costs nothing to offer
prayers and that the pressmen will announce that prayers were offered for the success of
the mission at so many places. But in reality it is a most difficult thing that Mr. Andrews
has asked us to do. On e can give of one’s possessions willingly or unwillingly or even for
a show one may give unwilling intellectual assent to a proposition. But there is no such
thing as unwilling or showy heart co -operation. And what Mr. Andrews wants is heart co -
operation, for, prayer is nothing else but an intense longing of the heart. You may express
yourself through the lips; you may express yourself in the private closet or in public; but
to be genuine, the expression must come from the deepest recesses of the heart. Let those
who can, that is those who believe in the cause of the Indians of South Africa and who
believe in God and therefore in prayer, set apart some time on the nineteenth instant for
the heart co -operation with the Indian settlers of South Africa and invo ke God’s blessings
on the deliberations of the Conference.
If there is anybody in India who still does not know what the Indian cause in
South Africa is, let him or her understand that the very existence of the Indians in South
Africa is at stake. Speci fically, the Asiatic Bill that was suspended during the last session
of the Union Parliament and which will be subject matter of discussion is a Bill which is
so designed as to make it impossible for any self -respecting Indian to remain in South
Africa. Le t those who do not know the legal position of Indians in South Africa realise
that they have practically no political status whatsoever within the Union. They have no
rights even of residence in Orangia except as domestic servants. In many parts they
canno t become owners of landed property. Throughout South Africa, the trading rights
have been considerably curtailed and the administration of the existing legislation
regarding trading rights is becoming more and more severe against Indian traders, even
again st those who are holders of trading licences of long standing. I say nothing about the
social barriers that have been erected against them and consequent difficulties about
freedom of travelling etc. They have hardly any facility for the education of their children
worth the name. The position, therefore, it will be seen, is precarious enough as it is. The
Asiatic Bill,242if it is passed, will put the finishing touch. The Conference has been
brought about after tremendous difficulties to ease the situation and to secure the barest
justice for the Indian settler. And it is on this effort that C. F. Andrews seeks to invoke
the blessing of God on the nineteenth instant. Let those who believe, in all humility,
tender their heart co -operation.

I am glad you are having a prayer meeting in response to the appeal of that good
soul Andrews. The problem in South Africa is the problem of the removal of
untouchability. The work of the Conference now (being) held in South Africa will have a
far-reaching effect not only on Indians but on all Asiatics, Negroes and others. Let us
pray to God that He may inspire the members of the Conference with wisdom and that
justice may be done.

117. SPEECH AT FORTY -FIRST SESSION OF THE INDIAN
NATIONAL CONGRESS, GAUHATI, DECEMBER 26, 1926243
Gandhiji said that Mr. C. F. Andrews had kept him in touch with the position in
South Africa through correspondence. Mr. Andrews had emphasised in his letters that
prayers should be held all over for divine guidance of the Round Table Conference. Need
forsuch prayer was paramount. They knew that the Indian Government had no power to
force its will on South Africa. The recent Imperial Conference had conceded to the
Dominions even greater freedom and independence in the field of imperial relations.
They cou ld, therefore, only pray to God to shower His blessings on those engaged in the
discussions of the Round Table Conference so that enlightened by the divine blessings,
the Conference might concede justice to the Indian settlers in South Africa.
243Gandhiji addressed the Congress in Hindi while moving the following resolution:
"This Congress welcomes the Round Table Conference now sitting in
South Africa to deliberate upon the best method of dealing with the question of
the status of Indian settlers in that sub -continent and prays for divine blessing and
guidance upon its deliberations.
"This Congress once more tenders its thanks to that good Englishman,
Mr. C. F. Andrews, who has been chiefly instrumental in preparing in South
Africa a calm atmosphere suitable for the holding of the Conferenc e.
"This Congress authorises the President to cable the text of the
resolution to General Hertzog, Sir M. Habibullah and Mr. C. F. Andrews."
The resolution was seconded by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and passed
unanimously.
General Hertzog was Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa and Sir M.
Habibullah leader of the Indian delegation to the Round Table Conference.He then dr ew the attention of the audience to the fact that the untouchability of
South Africa, from which their countrymen were suffering, was nothing but a
repercussion of Indian untouchability. It therefore behoved them to put their own house
in order.
He remin ded the South African statesmen that history showed those who having
power abused it prepared for their own ruin, and implored them to grant the Indian
settlers elementary justice which they desired. They did not ask for favours; in fact they
had forgone, for the sake of peace, things they need not have in strict justice.

118. COMPARISON WIT H UNTOUCHABILITY
... We who are responsible for Indian untouchability are ourselves victims of it in South
Africa. It is a case over again of "the biter bitten." We have sown the wind in India, we
are reaping the whirlwind in South Africa.
The Round Ta ble Conference is now sitting to consider whether there is a way out.
Andrews is making Herculean efforts to bring about a happy result. He has mobilised the
purest forces of South Africa in favour of the cause.
Let us, however, see the difference betwee n the two untouchabilities. The Indian is
withering. The axe has been laid at its root. Enlightened public opinion is against it. No
one whose opinion carries any weight defends it. The chains that bind the "untouchables"
are daily being broken. Law does n ot countenance it. What there is of it is all due to the
persistence of custom. Customs die hard, they long survive the withdrawal of legal
sanction, especially if they are ancient. The disappearance of Indian untouchability is
now purely a question of tim e.
The South African species on the other hand is growing into a hardy tree. It is being daily
armed with fresh legal sanctions. The legal disabilities of the Indian untouchables of
South Africa have grown with every sitting of the Union Parliament since 1915 in spite
of the final settlement of 1914. It is spreading in other parts of the British Empire, as was
made plain by the Kenya letter printed last week in these columns.
It is against this growing evil that Andrews is fighting almost single -handed in South
Africa. Let us hope that his efforts will be crowned with success.
But the very best way of dealing with the evil no doubt is to rid ourselves of it in India.
The members of the Union deputation244were heard to say more than once that it would
244The Parliamentary delegation from South Africa headed by F. W. Beyers, whichbetime for Indians to agitate for the removal of the bar in South Africa when they had
got rid of it in India. No doubt they forgot or did not know that with us here, there was no
legislative bar against the untouchables. But it would ill become us to advan ce an
argument of that nature when we are seeking justice. There is a fine legal maxim which is
applicable to our case. Those who seek justice must come with clean hands. The best case
therefore that we can prepare against South African untouchability is t o put our own
house in order. Till then, I suppose, we will have to be content with what palliatives the
Round Table Conference secures for us...

119. SIR HABIBULLAH DEPUTATION –I
Mr. C. F. Andrews cables:
"ADVISABLE DELEGATION STAY TILL FEBRUARY TO TIDE
OVER PROVINCIAL ELECTION AND KEEP ATMOSPHERE CALM."
I do hope that it would be possible for Lord Irwin245to comply with Mr. Andrews
advice and permit the deputation to stay in South Africa till the elections are over. The
elections in South Africa, as everywhere else, raise not the best thoughts but the worst
passions and create bad blood. There is no doubt that the deputation’s will be a
restraining influence. But that, of course, from a South African point of view, may be the
best reason for sending the deputation away before the elections begin. The candidates
may resent the courteous curb that the presence of the deputation must impose upo n a
free flow of their eloquence.
Young India , December 30, 1926; Collected Works , Volume 32, page 477
120. SIR HABIBULLAH DEPUTATION –II
I tender heartiest welcome to Sir Habibullah deputation on its return home. The
public have not yet suf ficient knowledge for forming a definite opinion about the results
of the deputation. One thing is however certain that they have by their tact, ability and
cohesion contributed not a little to the peaceful atmosphere that reigned supreme whilst
the Round Table Conference was going on. One can only hope that the atmosphere will
be reflected in the result of their deliberations. Not much importance need be attached to
the cablegram from South Africa attributing the opinion on the part of a section of the
Indian settlers, rejecting the conclusions of the Round Table Conference. It is as yet too
arrived in India on a three -week visit at the invitation of the Government of India. Please
see item 107 above.
245Viceroy of India, 1926 -31early. The opinion can only be based upon conjecture, for nobody knows what the
conclusions are. We are therefore bound to suspend judgement till we have the full text
before us of the agreement said to have been arrived at between the parties. The ever
vigilant Mr. Andrews is there to watch Indian interests.
In this connection an Indian settler sends me the following appropriate reflections
on the delibera tions:246
"Recent messages from South Africa through Reuter's agency and Mr. C. F.
Andrews suggest that with the enhanced status acquired by the Union of South
Africa... she has begun to view the Indian question... in a more generous spirit...
"The Round Table Conference too according to the Hon. Mr. Sastri247
has terminated successfully and Mr. Sastri has expressed his thorough satisfaction
with the agreement arrived at between the Union and the Indian Government
delegates... We can only wi sh that his high hopes may be fulfilled. Mr. Sastri has
further advised the Indian settlers: ‘If you, our people from India, play the game,
it will not be long before you get your due... even in the measure that you expect.’
Mr. Sastri has thus given the Indian settlers the hope that they would even be
granted full civic rights. Whether Indians are given full civic rights or not, even if
the present policy of persecuting and driving Indians from pillar to post is
abandoned and they are allowed to earn an h onest livelihood undisturbed and
unmolested -the labour of the Conference will not have been in vain.
"It were well to give the advice to play the game to the Union
Government. Even while we are given the hope of a satisfactory settlement of the
Indian q uestion and while we are being told that a change of heart has taken place,
we find that the policy of depriving Indians of their means of livelihood and
ousting them is being persistently pursued by the provincial governments with the
sanction of the Unio n Government.
"The Town Council of Pietermaritzburg is clearing what it has chosen to
term the European locality of every single Indian trader by refusing to grant him a
renewal of his licence. Many old established firms have thus already had to close
down their businesses in those places without any compensation whatsoever.
From a report published in Indian Opinion dated December 31, we find that
several tailors, shoemakers and barbers who were carrying on their respective
occupations for the last ten, f ifteen and twenty years have been refused licences
on the only ground that they were Indians, and on appeal the decision of the
Licensing Officer was upheld by the Town Council in every case. That this should
happen just when the Conference was deliberatin g is not a little surprising and it
is a glaring illustration of who has not been playing the game."

121. HONOURABLE COMPROMISE
Sir Mahomed Habibullah and his colleag ues are to be congratulated upon having secured
a settlement that is honourable to both parties. It is not the best that could be conceived,
but it is the best that was possible. I doubt if any other deputation could have done more.
The Class Areas Bill, w hich brought about the Conference and round which the battle
raged, is dead and gone. The Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri, who when the deputation sailed
for South Africa was of all members the most communicative and had warned us not to
expect much, did not con ceal at the end of the labours of the Conference his satisfaction
at the result. A perusal of the settlement warrants the satisfaction.
But like all compromises this one is not without its danger points. The dropping of the
Class Areas Bill is balanced b y repatriation, re -emerging as re -emigration. If the name is
more dignified, it is also more dangerous. Repatriation could only be to India. Re -
emigration can be to any country. The following sentence in the settlement clearly points
to that interpretatio n: "The Union Government therefore will organise a scheme of
assisted emigration to India or other countries where Western standards are not required."
This assisted emigration to other countries I hold to be dangerous, for there is no knowing
what may hap pen to the poor ignorant men going to an unknown land, where they would
be utter strangers. Such countries as would have taken them would only be either Fiji or
British Guiana. Neither has a good name in India. It is decidedly a disadvantage to have
been p arty to assisted emigration to any other part of the world.
The good point about this assisted emigration is that whereas before the settlement the
repatriates lost their domicile, the re -emigrants now retain it and lose it only if they
absent themselves so long as to warrant the inference that there is no intention on their
part to return to South Africa. How many assisted emigrants can hope to refund the
assistance in money they might have received or how many can hope to return with their
families is a different question. The non -forfeiture clause is clearly designed not so much
to guarantee a substantial right as not to hurt national self -respect.
The annexure, containing a summary of "conclusions and recommendations reached by
the Round Table Confer ence on the Indian question in South Africa," is a remarkable
document betraying in every paragraph a heroic attempt to reconcile conflicting interests
and sentiments. The industrious reader will have no difficulty in discovering hopeful
paragraphs. I shal l therefore content myself with drawing attention to a paragraph that is
fraught with grave danger. The Union Government is "to take special steps under the
Public Health Act for an investigation into the sanitary and housing conditions in and
around Durba n, which will include the question of the limitations of sale of municipal
lands subject to restrictive conditions." I do not know what is aimed at in this paragraph,
but my suspecting mind -and suspicion is based upon previous bitter experience of
interp retations, warranted and unwarranted, that a strong party places upon agreementswith a weak party to the latter’s disadvantage -conjures up all kinds of frightful
consequences arising from this proposed committee and limitation. Already the Durban
Corpor ation has been invested with powers which it has utilised for the suppression of its
Indian citizens. So far as I know a committee can bring to light nothing that is not known
to the Corporation or the Government. The appointment of an advisory committee o f
Indians may be simple padding. The Health Committee may bring in a hysterical report,
as a previous committee to my knowledge has done, and limitations may be put upon the
purchase of municipal lands by Indians which may cramp the Indian community residi ng
in Durban. Nor do I like the paragraph which seems to imply that provincial governments
are at liberty to take any action they might against the Indian settlers without reference to
the Central Government.
But the compromise is acceptable in spite of the dangers referred to by me, not so much
for what has been actually achieved as for the almost sudden transformation of the
atmosphere in South Africa from one of remorseless hostility towards Indians to that of a
generous toleration and from complete so cial ostracism to that of admission of Indians to
social functions. Mr. Andrews sends me a glowing account of the utmost cordiality with
which the Indian members of the deputation were received alike by the Government and
the people, how local Indians were able to gain entry to the most fashionable hotel in
Cape Town without any let or hindrance and how the Europeans in South Africa were
flocking to him to know all about the Indian deputation and the Indian question. If this
atmosphere of goodwill and socia bility is kept up and encouraged, the settlement can be
used as a solid foundation for erecting a beautiful temple of freedom for the Indian
settlers in South Africa. But the success of the settlement very largely depends upon the
selection of the Consul o r Commissioner who will be selected to represent the
Government of India. He must be a person of eminence, great ability and great strength
of character, and in my opinion, he must be an Indian. The very fact of his being an
Indian will strike the imaginat ion of the European population and raise the Indian settlers
in European estimation. He will reach the heart of Indians in a way no Englishman, not
even perhaps Mr. Andrews, can, and if a man can be selected who will command the
equal esteem of the Union G overnment we need not fear the future. Such a man in my
humble opinion is Mr. Srinivasa Sastri. I cannot conclude this hasty survey of the
settlement without placing on record my deepest conviction that the happy result is
predominantly due to the ceaseles s and prayerful labours of that godly self -effacing
Englishman, Charlie Andrews.

Editors’ Note
Gandhiji was happy that the Government agreed to appoint a non-official Indian -
V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, the scholarly and sagacious inheritor of Gokhale's
mantle -as the first Agent in South Africa. Gandhiji had great confidence in
Sastri who had played an important role at the round table conference in Cape
Town. He had, in fact, suggested Sastri's name and persuaded him to accept the
assignment.
Gandhiji saw the Agent`s task as the modest one of seeing that "no fresh
restrictive legislation was embarked upon by the Union Government and that the
existin g restrictive laws are administered liberally and with due regard to the
vested rights." (Item 122). The position of Indians had deteriorated so much
that it was difficult even to conceive of a return to the legal status and
expectations of 1914.
Gand hiji helped Sastri in his work, both with advice tendered to him and by
calling on Indian South Africans to cooperate with him fully. He defended Sastri
from criticism, even by his son Manilal.
Gandhiji had felt that since 1920 when he had become a non -cooperator, he could
do little to help Indian South Africans as he had no influence with the Indian
Government and the Government was not responsive to public opinion. But now he was
able to work with and through Sastri who represented not only the Gove rnment but in a
way the people of India. Gandhiji, therefore, advised Indians in South Africa to seek help
from Sastri, rather than himself.
Significantly, in letters to Sastri and to Indians in South Africa, as well as
in articles in Young India , Gandh iji stressed the need for unity in the
community -a need of which he was becoming increasingly conscious in the
deteriorating communal situation within India as well.
Sastri was able to establish reasonably good relations with the leaders and
officia ls of the South African Government and helped mitigate the problems of
the Indians. For instance, the government agreed to a condonation scheme for
Indians who entered the Transvaal on "fraudulent" certificates obtained before
1914 when the officials of the Asiatic Department in the Transvaal were corrupt.
All through 1928 and 1929 Gandhiji received a regular flow of letters, cablesand memoranda from South Africa on different questions agitating Indian settlers
there. And the work of C.F. Andrews th ere continued to bring him joy and hope.
Sastri completed his tenure in South Africa in 1929 and returned to India.
Gandhiji wrote to his successor, K.V. Reddi: "I continue to receive anxious
enquiries from South Africa. I am obliged to tell them all th at they should
worry you and not expect much from here." (Item 153).
"...not expect much from here." Was Gandhiji withdrawing from his involvement in
South African affairs? On the contrary. He was, rather, seeking to encourage in
the Indian settlers th e self -suffiency that was essential for the success of their struggle. A
self-sufficiency, essentially, in the matter of initiative and
leadership.
But, regrettably, there were serious divisions and rivalries among leaders of
the Indian community for s everal years. Different groups and personalities were
seeking favours from the Agent, instead of serving the community. They had
become dependent on the Agent and hence the Indian Government.
Moreover, when Gandhiji learned of the fate of those "repatr iated" from South
Africa to India, including many Indians born in South Africa, he became
disillusioned about the terms and operation of the Cape Town Agreement. He wrote in
Young India on June 4, 1931:
"There should have been no agreed repatriation at all, and if there was to be any,
there should have been ample provision previously made to ensure proper
occupation for them, and in any case there should never have been any consent
to the repatriation of colonial -born Indians, of whom there are fully thirty -three
percent in the Calcutta depot."
He warned against bartering away the rights of the poor labouring population
"for doubtful concessions to the other Indian settlers." (Item 157).
This section includes affectionate reminiscences of Imam Abdul Kadir Bawazeer,
who was with him in the satyagraha in South Africa and became a member of his
ashram in India.
Long gaps occur in the references to South African affairs from 1929 to 1939 due
to Gandhiji's incarcerations and involvement in the fluctuating fortunes of the
Indian National Movement.
122. SASTRI AS FIRST AMBASSADOR
Very considerable relief will be felt by the Indian settlers in South Africa
over the announcement that the Rt. Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri has consented to
become India’s first Agent -General in that sub -continent, if the post is finallyoffered to him by the Government of India.248
It is a great sacrifice that Sastri and the Servants of India Society have made.
It is an open secret that left to himself he was not inclined to undertake the
responsibility and to leave his work in India. But he has yielded to the
pressure of friends, especially when it was urged upon him that he alone could
successfully inaugurate the working of the Agreement in bringing about which he
played not an inconsiderable part. We know from the cables that were sent from
time to time from South Africa that the Europeans were anxious that he should
accept the honour. Sjt. Srinivasa Sastri had by his eloquence, transparent
sincerity, sweet reasonableness, and extreme earnestness won the esteem and
respect of the Union Government and the Europeans in South Africa during the
short time that he was there as a member of the Habibullah deputation... I know
how nervously anxious our coun trymen in South Africa were that he should become the
first Agent. It was impossible for Sjt. Srinivasa Sastri whom God has
endowed with a generous nature not to respond to such a unanimous call from
South Africa. It is almost a foregone conclusion that the appointment will be
duly made and very shortly announced.
The first Agent -General will have his work cut out for him. Both the Union
Government and our countrymen have no doubt high expectations of India`s first
ambassador. The Union Government no doubt think that being an Indian and a
person of great distinction he will make their path smooth with the Indian
community in connection with any measures that they may take. In other words,
they will expect him to be their sympathetic interpreter bot h to the Indian
community and to the Government of India. Our countrymen equally surely expect him
to insist upon an honourable and even a liberal interpretation and
fulfilment of the Agreement. It is any time a delicate task to please rival
claimants, more so now in South Africa where the clash of conflicting interests
is simply bewildering. But I know that if anybody can hold the scales absolutely
even and thus give satisfaction to all parties concerned, Sjt. Srinivasa Sastri
is certainly the one to be able to do so. I feel certain that the Union
Ministers do not expect the new Agent to surrender an inch of what is justly due
to the Indian community. All he can be expected to do is to persuade the Indian
settlers not to go behind and travel beyond the Settlement of 1914, for some
time to come at any rate, until they have proved themselves entitled, by
exemplary self -restraint and behaviour, to an enlargement of the position
attained by the Agreement of 1914. Our countrymen in South Africa, if th ey
intend to make the Agent’s position fairly easy and their own position secure,
will not expect him to work wonders. It will be wrong to look forward to a
248Mr. Sastri was appointed representative of the Government of India in South
Africa with the title of "Agent" and served in that capacity for a year and a
half from 1927 to 1929. The rank of the representative was raised to
"Agent -General" in 1935.complete transformation of the old position, because an honourable Agreement has been
arrived at and because a great countryman is going to South Africa to see to the
fulfilment of that Agreement. They must remember that the Rt. Hon.
Srinivasa Sastri is not going there as their counsel briefed to attend to every
individual grievance. To smother him with detailed individual grievances would
be to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. He goes there as a trustee for
India’s honour. He goes there to safeguard the rights and liberty of the general
body of Indian settlers. He will be there to see t hat no fresh restrictive
legislation is embarked upon by the Union Government and that the existing
restrictive laws are administered liberally and with due regard to the vested
rights. Any individual grievance therefore that he might be called upon to
tackle will have to be in terms of the position I have set forth, that is to
say, it will have to be illustrative of some general principle of wide
application. Unless therefore the Indian community exercises prudential
restraint upon themselves in app roaching him for redress of their individual
grievances, they will make the Agent’s position intolerable and even useless for
the high purpose for which it is intended. Indeed such an ambassador`s
usefulness lies not so much in work appertaining to his official capacity as to
the indirect service he can render by his sociableness, and by his character,
which leaves its impress upon anything and anybody that it comes in contact with
officially or otherwise. And if our countrymen desire to make use of t he great
qualities of head and heart that Sjt. Sastri possesses, they will bear in mind
the limitations I have endeavoured to set forth.
I understand that if Sjt. Sastri goes, Mrs. Sastri too will accompany him. This
will be a great gain to the settle rs...

123. APPEAL TO SOUTH AFRICAN INDIANS249
The Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri has yielded to the pressure of friends in
accepting the office of the first ambassador for India in South A frica, at the
sacrifice of his cherished wishes, solely with the object of serving you. It
rests with you to make the best use of his services and his presence amongst
you. You cannot do so unless you fulfil the following conditions:
1. You will not e xpect too much.
2. You will not try to seek relief in purely individual cases through him.
3. You will not swerve from truth in your dealings with him. To be false to him
would be to be false to yourselves.
4. You will remain completely united.
249The Gujarati original, from which this was translated, was publishe d in
Navajivan , May 15, 1927.5. You will put your own house in order and purify yourselves.
You will not assume that all your grievances will disappear with the coming of
the Rt. Hon. Sastri as the first Agent. He will have done enough if he succeeds
in seeing that no new restrictive leg islation is passed against you, that the
operation of the old restrictive enactments is not made unnecessarily harsh and
that the spirit of the new Agreement is carried out by the Union Government.
The Rt. Hon. Sastri is going there as the representati ve, not of individuals,
but of India as a whole. He is going there to uphold the prestige of India.
Therefore you will not run to him for relief in every individual case. If you
do, you will make the mistake of expending a pound for the matter of a penn y.
Our strength depends solely on truth. No matter how you behave in your business
dealings, you will never in the interests of the community think of swerving
from the path of truth in your dealings with the Rt. Hon. Sastri. In attempting
to deceive him you will be working your own ruin.
We here constantly receive reports of dissensions amongst you. If you go on
creating different and conflicting interests, e.g., the rights of the rich as
distinguished from those of the poor, the rights of the Nor th Indians as
distinguished from those of South Indians, of the Colonial -born as distinguished
from those of the merchants, of the latter from those of the indentured, of the
Transvaal Indians as distinguished from those of the Cape Indians and Natal
Indians, you will lose the little that you have gained. If you want to better
the position of the whole community, you will always stand united.
We are ultimately to win by our own endeavour which does not mean sharp
practice, but self -purification, whi ch again means reform from within and
purging ourselves of evil customs and superstitions, educating our children, and
contributing money for education as well as other measures of social reform. In
this work of self -purification, the Rt. Hon. Sastri’s profound experience as an
educationist and reformer should be very helpful, and the presence of Mrs.
Sastri should be an inspiration to our women.
You will never get another such opportunity in the near future of ameliorating
your condition. In my opi nion it was impossible to find a worthier, abler and
more impartial representative than the Rt. Hon. Sastri. Let us believe that the
Hand of God has brought about this happy consummation. It rests with you
entirely to benefit or not by the chance which God has in his mercy given you.
May He show you the right path.

Nandi Hills,
May 15, 1927
Dear brother,
I must dictate this letter. I forgot to mention one thing to you. I think I gave
you the name of Umar Hajee Ahmed Jhaveri, one of the most truthful men I have
met in my life.250If he has thought ill of a person, I have known him to tell him so and
apologise. He is the brothe r of the very first Indian merchant who went to South Africa,
the late Abubakar Ahmed. Umar Hajee Ahmed has considerable property in Durban and
has a plot of land with handsome buildings in a central place in Church Street, Pretoria.
This property was the only property registered in the name of an Indian in the Transvaal.
It became a point of honour with us to
insist upon that property remaining in the ownership of Indians. Mr. Jhaveri was
telling me that there was some dispute about it. I don’t remember the exact
circumstances in which the matter stands at present, though of course the past
history I know well. This is a matter that might come before you. You will then
recall the fact that I mentioned it to you. This is no individual matter but one
ofnational concern. There is correspondence about this between General Smuts
and myself. You will see all the papers if the case ever comes before you.
I saw Dr. Malan’s cable. It was splendid. I am glad you are going so early as
8th June. Poor Andrews is being torn to pieces, and you will not reach South
Africa a moment too soon.
The Natal Provincial Council’s vote is indeed a bad beginning. But in the Cape
Parliament the Natal vote counts for little. I have no doubt that you will have

unlike as in the Transvaal, the Orange and even the Cape, are proud of the
British connection. But, probably, you already know all such things.

125. HORRIBLE PRACTICES251
250Umar (or Omar, Omer) Jhaveri, an early associate of Gandhiji in South Africa
and a leader of the Indian community
251This was a comment on a letter from the Reverend C. F. Andrews who had
referred to the evil practices o f self -torture like "fire -walking" festivals byI know the temple at Umbilo, which may really be called a suburb of Durban. Even years
ago, when the temple was erected, I had my misgivings. Bitter experience has taught me
that all temples are not houses of God . They can be habitations of the devil. These places
of worship have no value unless the keeper is a good man of God. Temples, mosques,
churches are what man makes them to be. I am therefore not surprised at the painful and
horribly superstitious practices going on in this so -called temple. The origin of these
practices is easy enough to trace. There are three classes of Indians in South Africa. The
free Indian trader has nothing to do with these practices. Nor have the large number of
Colonial -born Indians who have received in the face of terrible odds a tolerably liberal
education. The third class is the indentured Indian, now become free. He is
drawn mainly from the poorest class here. Nothing has ever been done by the
Government or the employers or by the free Indian community to help these
unfortunate men and women out of their ignorance and superstition. The result is
that they are preyed upon by superstitious and even evil -minded men who pose as
priests and holy men. They mutter a few Sanskrit ve rses whose meaning they do
not know and which they horribly mispronounce, and resort to all kinds of
awe-inspiring practices. And what can be better than a temple, where simple
people congregate and where every kind of superstition derives a halo from
associations attributed to temples? I think that the common law of South Africa
is wide enough to deal with these practices if the Government desires to put
them down.
The fact is, unfortunately, that the prejudice against Indians in South Africa
is not ascribable to these practices, nor is it directed against the men who are
victims of this barbarism. It is directed chiefly against the free trading class
who have nothing to do with these practices. And therefore these practices have
gone without an y notice or comment. And if they are now being noticed, it is in
order to prejudice the European mind against the Habibullah Agreement252and
against what little relief is sought to be given to the Indian settlers. It
should also be borne in mind that the se practices are by no means common amongst
Indians throughout South Africa. They are confined only to the part of the coast of Natal
where indentured Indians are to be found in their largest numbers. If therefore the
Government intend to put these practic es down, they can do so under the common law
with ease, and they can be dealt with also through
municipal bye -laws. I am sure that if action is taken, not a voice will be raised against it
in the name of religion falsely so called for sheltering these pra ctices. No cultured Indian
will have anything to do with them, and the ignorant people who witness these tortures
with awe will not dare to defend them in a court of law. What we can do here is to
encourage cultured Indians in South Africa to fight the sup erstition. They should, without
Indians at Umbilo temple and to a page of pictures of such things in the Natal
Advertiser .

from these barbarisms, and advise them to help the Government, if they choose to
prosecute those who take part in those practices, thus sho wing their desire not to
reproduce in South Africa all that is bad in our life, but to reproduce only that which is
good in our civilisation. It is our duty to advise and encourage our countrymen in South
Africa to do nothing that will give a handle to the agitation against them.

however, hoping that Mr. Sastri’s arrival has smoothed matters over.
As soon as I got the cablegram from Johannesburg, I sent a reply which I hope
was duly received. Do please keep me informed of further developments...

My dear brother,
I was thankful for your first letter from South Africa. The hopeful note cheers
me.
The Transvaal , I see, is causing you some anxiety. But I have every hope that
the people there will ultimately listen to you.
I notice your appeal for social workers. You won`t get any from this end. I know
Devadhar255contemplates sending or even taking a batch. But my own feeling is
that it is essentially work for local volunteers. But whether it is done by
local volunteers or workers imported from here, the work is worth doing and has
got to be done. The Government of India, the Natal Government and the planters
are not a little to blame for the mischief. The tone having been once set, it is
tremendously difficult to set another all of a sudden. All strength to your
elbow.
Do please keep your health.
Andrews cabled about your expenses. I am not going to we ary you with what was
done here. But I am informed that you will have all the assistance you need. I
personally feel quite at ease. It is not the style of living that is going to
count in your case, it is your internal strength that is going to count an d is
counting already...
With love,

129. INDIAN SETTLERS IN SOUTH AFRICA
India`s first ambassador has not allowed the grass to grow under his feet. He is
busily sowing seeds of true uni on by a seasonable word now addressed to the
Europeans and now to the Indian settlers, and he seems to be having fair success
with both. Europeans gracefully acknowledge his splendid worth and exquisite
impartiality. Indians gratefully recognise the imm ense strength of character
which backs every word that this great son of India utters.
He has now appealed to them to produce an army of social workers in the cause of
public health and sanitation. Let us hope that his appeal will not fall upon
deaf e ars, and that well -to-do and educated Indians will respond as zealously as
they did when C. F. Andrews appealed to them for assistance for the scavenging
work he did during the outbreak of smallpox in Durban some months ago.256
Agent though he is of the G overnment, if Reuter`s report is correct, Sjt. Sastri
did not spare it over its criminal indifference about the sanitary and social
welfare of the indentured Indians. For the neglect of sanitation amongst the
indentured Indians, three parties are really responsible -the Government of
India, the employers, and the local government. If the Government of India had
insisted upon a minimum standard, and if the employers had taken a human
interest in the employees and the local government had considered th e indentured
Indians as future citizens of South Africa, they would have learnt, during their
five years’ indenture, habits of modern sanitation. For during the five years of
indenture they had to live like soldiers in barracks and they could have been
made to conform to any reasonable sanitary regulations that might have been
framed, even as they were made to conform to labour regulations which were often even
harsh and severe. But this is past history. There is no more indentured
emigration now.
The question is now to make of the existing Indian population model citizens,
and if the Government and the Indian settlers cooperate, it is not at all
impossible to set a better tone, and create a healthy Indian public opinion that
would not tolerate an y insanitation or ugliness. Let the Indian settlers do
their part of forming sanitation brigades, cleaning up latrines and streets and
instructing ignorant people in the elementary laws of sanitation, even as they
did in 1897 in Durban. Sjt. Sastri’s wo rk will be fruitless unless he is
willingly and whole -heartedly helped by the Indian settlers. They must conform
to the wholesome maxim of law that those who seek justice or equity must come
with clean hands. Let the settlers be clean in body, mind and soul, and thus
256Please see item 111 above.make the best use of the golden opportunity they have of having an Ambassador
who has got the ability to serve them and who has in a remarkable measure the
ear of the European inhabitants of South Africa.

thought it worth while to spend mone y on cabling the following to me:
"SASTRI’S SUCCESS UNPRECEDENTED. GOVERNOR -GENERAL
ADMIRABLY SUPPORTING, ALSO MINISTERS AND OFFICIALS."
It is difficult to trust Andrews with any monies for telegraphic charges, and
yet I cannot summon sufficient coura ge to swear at him for this cable news. I am
not going to make use of it for the press. I never had any doubt about your
success. All I want to be sure of is your health.
I see you are already telling the public that your term of office will not go
beyond one year. Anyway I have your assurance that you will not run away even
for the Commission if your presence is indispensable there at the end of the

142. INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA: TWO CASES
Two very important cases have been decided recently by the Transvaal Provincial
Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. One of them, S. B. Medh v. Immigra nts
Appeal Board , though important in itself, affects only a few special cases of Indians who
received exemption certificates under the Smuts -Gandhi Settlement as being educated
Indians. It was contended by the Union Government that the exemptions were not
complete. I need not go into greater detail. The Court has now found that the exemptions
were complete in the sense submitted on behalf of the appellant.
The other case, Daya Purshottam v. Immigrants Appeal Board , has far -reaching
consequences for the I ndian settlers. The judgement in this case lays down that section 5
of Act 37 of 1927 does not possess retrospective effect. Hence certificates obtained by
fraudulent means do not become cancellable at the will of the Immigration Board or the
Immigration O fficer. If this judgement stands, holders of certificates even though they
were originally tainted will remain undisturbed. This is a great victory for the settlers. I
have no desire to see fraud in any shape or form protected. But the case of these settle rs is
not one of ordinary fraud. In many cases, at least up to 1914 the Asiatic Office259was a
corrupt department and it made it practically impossible for bona fide entrants to enter
unless they resorted to some crooked means so as to satisfy the greed of the Asiatic
officers. Where Government officials are privy to fraud, it ill becomes that Government
to punish the helpless victims.
Cables from the South African settlers tell me that the Government are appealing against
the two decisions. I venture to s uggest to the Union Government that it would be more in
258Pragjivan Desai
259In the Transvaalkeeping with their conciliatory attitude and the spirit of the new understanding that they
do not seek to deprive the Indians of the advantage the two appeals give them. The
judgement in the first app eal protects only a few individuals. And in their case there is no
question of fraud. The judgement in the second appeal protects a fair number of those
who are already in the Union. It will be no serious calamity for the Union to have to
absorb a few more Indians than the Government had counted upon. The Union
Government should remember that these appeals are very expensive affairs especially for
the poor Indians. It is hardly fair for an organised powerful Government to take
successful citizens through ap pellate courts and thus exhaust them into submission or
worse. It may be well to possess a giant’s strength, but it is admittedly wrong to use it
against dwarfs.
The settlers will do well not to set much store by their success in these two appeals. They
have in Sjt.Sastri a great friend and adviser. Let them press their suit as much as ever
before him but having done so let them abide by his advice. He will use in their behalf all
the influence he has acquired with the Union Government. I welcome their c ables. I
appreciate the trust they repose in me. But my power to help them from this distance and
in the changed circumstances I found myself in 1920 is much too limited to be of value.
Their strength therefore lies in their unity, moderation and reliance upon one who is not
merely Agent -General for the Government of India but is their true and powerful friend
and guide.

143. FOR SOUTH AFRICA INDIANS
A cable from the Secretary, South African Indian Congress, Johannesburg, says:
"CONDONATION SCHEME ACCEPTED. ILLEGAL ENTRANTS IN THE
UNION NOW IN INDIA MUST EITHER RETURN BEFORE 30TH SEPTEMBER
NEXT OR SEND APPLICATIONS TO REACH BEFORE THAT DATE THE
COMMISSIONER, ASIATIC AFFAIRS, PRETORI A. AFTER SENDING
APPLICATIONS THEY MUST RETURN TO THE UNION BEFORE 30TH
MARCH, 1929. GIVE WIDE NEWSPAPER PUBLICITY ALL PARTS INDIA."
This ends the agitation that was going on in South Africa in respect of the condonation
scheme and was making the Rt. Hon . Sastri's position difficult and causing an anxious
time in South Africa as well as here. Let those Indians, who have domiciled rights in
South Africa, are holders of certificates and are desirous of availing themselves of the
right of return, make haste to send their applications so as to reach the Commissioner of
Asiatic Affairs, Pretoria, on or before the 30th September next, unless they propose to
proceed to South Africa themselves so as to reach there before that date. Each applicant
should give full particulars, giving name, address, occupation, date and number of
certificates and disclose all relevant facts. The application should be sent by registered
post in good time...Young India , July 19, 1928; Collected Works , Volume 37, pages 72 -73
144. SOUTH AFRICA'S CONTRIBUTION
A friend writes from South Africa:
"Reuter cabled from India that the South African Indians are sending every month
fivelakhs of rupees for the Bardoli no -tax campaign. A mischievous thing, besides
being a gross exaggeratio n. The prejudice caused by the remittance of moneys to
India will now be deepened and given a sharp edge. So far as I have been able to
ascertain, about £500 have been sent in all for the Bardoli fund."260
It has not been without pain that I have followed the campaign of lies that has gathered
round the Bardoli struggle. Nothing was evidently considered too mean or too palpably
absurd to damage a cause which had no secrecy about it and which was intended to cause
no injury to a single soul and which had no direct political aim. Without verification and
probably from malice prepense the falsehood that lakhs of rupees were being received by
satyagrahis from South Africa was given currency. Well, the cause of satyagraha was
not damaged by the false statement. B ut the cause of Indians in South Africa can be
easily damaged if the white colonists can be persuaded that vast sums of money are being
sent from South Africa to Bardoli and that to sustain an agitation which they may dislike.
I hope however that not much notice was taken of the statement in South Africa. Anyway
I can corroborate what the correspondent says. Anyone can look at the accounts lying at
Bardoli or receipts for the Bardoli Fund and he will find that the correspondent’s
information is much nearer the truth than the inflammatory statement cabled to South
Africa.

146. SASTRI'S WORK
A graphic l etter received this week from an eye -witness describes the now famous
Klerksdorp incident of which the South African press is full. Though nothing remains or
needs to be said from the political standpoint after the full, free and frank apology from
the Un ion Government, too much cannot be said of Sjt.Sastri's generous and courageous
behaviour in the face of a plot which might have proved fatal in its result. The letter
before me shows how this true son and representative of India stood his ground without
the least nervousness even when the lights were put out by the party that had come led by
the Deputy Mayor to break up the meeting he was addressing. And when the firing of an
explosive had made the meeting hall too suffocating for the audience, Sjt.Sastr i went
outside and, as if nothing untoward or serious had happened, finished his speech without
even referring to the incident. Popular as he had already become among the Europeans of
South Africa before this incident, his cool courage and generous behavio ur raised him
still further in this estimation.262
And as he wanted no fame for himself (few men would be found shier than Sjt.Sastri of
fame), he turned his popularity to the advancement of the cause he has represented with
such singular ability and succ ess. During his all too brief stay in South Africa he has
immensely raised the status of our countrymen in that part of the world. Let us hope that
they will by their exemplary conduct show themselves worthy of him.
But Sastri's contribution to the solut ion of the difficult and delicate problem of South
Africa does not rest merely upon what was after all an accident. We know nothing except
through the results of the inner working of the ambassador’s office in which he had to
exhaust all his art of a diplo macy that comes from a conviction of the correctness of one’s
cause and that spurns to do or countenance anything wrong, mean or crooked. But we do
know how unsparing he has been in the use on behalf of his cause of the gifts of
eloquence, scholarship, bot h English and Sanskrit, and great and varied learning with
which nature has lavishly endowed him. He has been delivering to large and select
261On the same day, Gandhiji cabled Mr. Jhaveri in Durban asking him to see Mr. Sastri. Collected Works ,
Volume 37, page 291.
Please see also item 124 above.
262The Anti -Asiatic party continued its agitation even after the Cape Town Agreement, and attempted a
boycott of the Indian shops.
In September 1928, when Mr. Sastri was invited to address a meeting in the Town Hall of Klerksdorp,
chaired by the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor led a group anti -Indian demonstrators who shouted insults at Mr.
Sastri and tried to disrupt the meet ing. After they exploded a stink bomb, the meeting was adjourned to the
outside and Mr. Sastri resumed his speech.
The South African Government apologised for the incident.audiences of Europeans lectures on Indian philosophy and culture which have stirred
European imagination and soften ed the hard crust of prejudice which has hitherto
prevented the general body of Europeans from seeing anything good in the Indian. These
lectures are perhaps his greatest and the most permanent contribution to the Indian cause
in South Africa.
It must be a serious problem for the Government of India to choose Sjt.Sastri's successor.
He has persistently withstood all pressure to prolong his stay in South Africa. Letters
from South Africa show me how our people dread Sjt.Sastri's impending departure. It
will be a calamity if a worthy successor is not found to continue the mission so
successfully inaugurated and represented by Sjt.Sastri. Tradition has, I hope, been set up
at the Viceregal Lodge of treating the office of India’s Agent in South Africa as ne utral
ground which the Government and popular parties may jointly tread. It is to be hoped that
the successor to be chosen will be one who will commend himself equally to the
Government and the people, and who will truly represent not merely the Government of
India but the people as well.

149. A SOUTH AFRICAN TR IBUTE TO MR. SASTRI
I have hitherto resisted the publication of the many tributes to the Rt. Hon. Sastri's work
in South Africa that I have found in the cuttings friends in South Africa have sent me. But
now that his return to the Motherland is imminent, I cannot resist the temptation to quote
in full the following ungrudging tribute from Professor Bell of Cape Town…264
His official work, great as it has been, has been outweighed by his unofficial contribution.
His transparent sincerity and his passionate love of his country made him give
unstintingly the whole of his matchless gifts to the service of the cause that took him to
South Africa. The result is a changed atmosphere in that sub -continent and a smoother
passage for his successor. Let me hope that the great service rendered by the
distinguished patriot to the country will be crowned by a rousing reception on his landing,
not for his sake but for ours.265

150. INTERVIEW TO SOUTH A FRICAN VISITOR266
...The third (interview) was with a highly educated African from South Africa. He had
received his education in America but had returned to the home of his ancestors to serve
his people. He was very much pained at the apathy of educated Af ricans towards their
own race. " They become altogether like aliens, they are lost to the race ," he bitterly
complained.
"We are crushed, trampled upon and oppressed. We do not know which way to turn.
The bulk of us are ignorant. The daughter of ignorance is poverty. The two processes
go hand in hand and move in a vicious circle. Then there is the outside force, pitiless

page 54.
266Based on the report by Pyarelal. The interview took place before March 1, 1929; the exact date is not
available.and unrelenting like a blind force of Nature without any possibility of reprieve or
appeal. We feel stricken and overwhelmed. Instinctive ly we turn to India for a
message of hope and deliverance, for we believe that India has a mission to fulfil with
regard to all the oppressed races of the world. "
Gandhiji was deeply touched.
"I had occasion to discuss this subject with the Natives whi le I was in South Africa. I
told them that they had got to help themselves and always to work in the hope that
help would come to them from somewhere when the hour for it arrived. In the
meantime they had to prepare themselves for it by a process of self -purification."
"I see your point, but what we want to understand from you is how to relate this inner
process with the actual problems of the day that confront us -how to set this process
of self -purification in motion."
"The first step is to turn the searchlight inward, to proclaim your feelings to yourself
and the world. There is nothing so debasing and demoralising as to conceal your
weakness and profess to have strength which you do not possess. The second thing
would be to set about boldly and fear lessly to purify public life. Unfortunately a
belief has today sprung up that one’s private character has nothing to do with one’s
public activity. This superstition must go. Our public workers must set about the task
of reforming society by reforming them selves first. This spiritual weapon of self -
purification, intangible as it seems, is the most potent means for revolutionising one’s
environment and for loosening external shackles. It works subtly and invisibly; it is
an intensive process and though it mi ght often seem a weary and long -drawn -out
process, it is the straightest way to liberation, the surest and the quickest, and no
effort can be too great for it. What it requires is faith -an unshakeable, mountain -like
faith that flinches from nothing."
Gandhiji thought that he had said enough and that the conversation was finished, but the
African friend sprang a big surprise upon him by telling him how much interested he had
been in India’s effort to revive the cottage industries of spinning and weaving. He was, he
said, anxious to introduce it among his own people who were victims of the economic
and moral consequences of unemployment and idleness. What appealed to him most
about spinning was the possibilities for awakening and fostering a sense of solid arity and
oneness among his people.
"We have some villages that grow their own food. We have experimentally begun to
grow cotton also. We want now to teach our people to manufacture their own cloth
and thus to make our villages practically self -contained . It will give us a new social
vision, and a new mass consciousness. "
He was sure that spinning could become a most potent means of mobilising race
consciousness against imperialistic exploitation. He enquired whether Gandhiji could
send a teacher to Sou th Africa. Gandhiji said his son Manilal could teach spinning."But I make a better and sporting offer. I would undertake to take six young men here
free of charge and give them a full course of training here. Only they will have to
accommodate themselve s to the discipline and the simplicity of life that prevails
here."
The African friend was pleased with the offer and said:
"Certainly, my people should lead a simple life. I shall certainly try to avail myself of
your offer. I hope to write to you fro m South Africa. "

151. SOUTH AFRICAN REPATRIATES
The Secretaries of the South African (Indian) Congress have sent me the following
letter:267
"It was stated that the Government of I ndia have taken no steps to assist the
repatriates, that they are stranded and are unable to find employment, that the present -
day conditions in India are not congenial to them, that reports have been read
conveyed by letters from repatriates, that owing t o absence of work and assistance
from the authorities, they are either starving or undergoing much suffering and
consequently many of them have, by force of adverse circumstances, migrated to Fiji
or Malaya.
"In the Cape Town Agreement, one of the condit ions accepted by the Government of
India in regard to the scheme is that on their arrival in India the emigrants will be
helped as far as possible to settle in the occupations for which they are best suited by
their aptitude or their resources...
"Judgin g from the report received from the repatriates, it is doubtful whether the
Government of India are doing anything at all to help the repatriates...
"This Congress will be extremely grateful to you if you will afford information on the
subject so that it may be guided in making full representations to the authorities."
I refrain from offering any comment at the present moment. But I shall await some
statement from the authorities. There is no doubt that if these repatriates are to be
received, they must be specially cared for. India to most of them is like a foreign land.

The office of the Agent of the Government of India in South Africa is certainly not a bed
of roses. Sir K. V. Reddi,268I see from the mail letter received from South Africa, is
having his hands full. The greatest cause of anxiety so far as I can see is in connection
with trade licences in the area known as the Gold Area in th e Transvaal. The largest
number of Indian traders in the Transvaal are to be found in this area and these trade
licences are a matter of life and death for them. They have built up large business in the
hope of being able to have their licences renewed fro m year to year. Having survived the
danger in the Kruger regime269of their businesses being summarily closed at any time,
they have rightly or wrongly come to believe that their licences will be perpetually
renewed so long as they carry on an honest trade. I have certainly thought that the
settlement of 1914270covered all these traders and their successors. If these were not
vested rights, I do not know what vested rights could be in the Transvaal for them.
But now I understand that municipalities are refus ing to issue these licences, taking cover
under a section of Gold Law. Legally speaking, perhaps the Gold Law would prohibit
Asiatics` trading. But that law was in existence even during the Kruger regime. It was in
existence in 1914 when this settlement wa s arrived at. Therefore Sir K.V. Reddi should
have no difficulty in securing protection for these traders.
The agreement which was brought about by the Habibullah deputation contemplates
levelling up of the British Indian position in South Africa. Levell ing up will be a
meaningless term for these traders if the only means of earning their bread and butter is
taken away from them. It is necessary therefore for public opinion here to strengthen the
hands of the Agent in South Africa and the hands of the Gov ernment of India in
prosecuting the claim for the protection of these traders.
The matter is not free from difficulty I know. There is the general election pending in
South Africa. The Union Ministers left to themselves will probably grant the protection
that is so desirable. And that should be considered as obligatory if there is to be an
honourable fulfilment of the Cape pact.271But the electoral conditions in South Africa are
not very different from these conditions in other parts of the world. But howe ver difficult
the situation may be, these traders must be protected.
There is a proper, legitimate, easy way out of the difficulty apart from fresh legislation.
Law 3 of 1885 of the Transvaal is still in existence. The Gold Law does not supersede

271The Cape Town Agreement of 1927 between the Union of South Africa and Indiathat la w. Therefore the Gold Law has got to be read in conjunction with the Law 3 of
1885. Now that law enables the Government to declare wards, streets and locations as
proper for Indian habitation and trade. It is open therefore to the Union Government by
admin istrative action to declare such areas where Indians are now trading to be proper
places for Indian trade and residence.
There are other matters equally delicate but I need not refer to them at this stage as the
danger in connection with them is not immi nent and as it is necessary for public opinion
to be crystallised and to concentrate over this single imminent danger.

153. LETTER TO SIR K. V. REDDI, AUGUST 20, 1929
Sabarmati,
August 20, 1929
Dear friend,
I thank you for your very full letter. I have been delayed in replying to it, owing to my
peregrinations and then illness from which, by the grace of God, I am recovering.
I do hope that the trade licences matter has been o r will be satisfactorily settled. I
continue to receive anxious enquiries from South Africa. I am obliged to tell them all that
they should worry you and not expect much from here. However, when you think that
intensive work here will assist you, you will please tell me.
The news you give me about matters educational is most encouraging. The success of
Sastri College must in the end go a long way towards raising our status in South Africa.
I know how true you are when you tell me about our people’s apat hy in matters in which
they are expected to exert themselves. I know even in our time the difficulties of the poor
vegetable hawkers. It was their amazing industry that I thought enabled them to walk
long distances early in the morning and dispose of, in t he best manner they could, their
produce before 9 a.m. May success attend your effort on their behalf.
Thank you for interesting yourself in Manilal and his wife. I hope they are helpful.
Yours sincerely,

154. A NATIONAL INSULTThe insulting and impossible (for a self -respecting man) conditions imposed by the Union
Government on the Ali Brothers in respect of their contemplated visit to South Africa272
demonstrate once more the truth of the proverb: "The leo pard cannot change his spots."
One had thought that after the friendly agreement arrived at the historic Round Table
Conference, after the wonderful work done by the Rt. Hon. Sastri in South Africa, the
insult offered to the Ali Brothers and through them t o the nation by the Union
Government was impossible. In view of the undertaking voluntarily given by the
Brothers, the Union Government could have felt sure that they would never deliver
political speeches. With reference to notabilities the convention is to assume correct
conduct on their part without the necessity of imposing galling restrictions. And even
when in such cases there is any doubt about such conduct, the convention is to ensure
safety through diplomatic and courteous channels. For instance in this very case the
Union Government, instead of conveying the restrictions to the Ali Brothers, could have
secured their purpose through the Government of India -in so far as it was legitimate. In
no case could they exact pecuniary security or impose a r idiculous time -limit as the
Union Government have sought to do. It is to be hoped that the Government of India will
see that this palpable wrong is righted, the restrictions are wholly withdrawn and the
Brothers permitted to proceed to South Africa without hurting their self -respect and
without undue restrictions, direct or indirect, tacit or implied.

155. THE BAN ON THE ALI BROTHERS
The following cable, which I have extended, has b een received by me from the
Secretaries of the South African Indian Congress:
"AT AN EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE MEETING HELD AT DURBAN ON THE
SITUATION ARISING OUT OF RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON THE ALI
BROTHERS` CONTEMPLATED VISIT TO THE UNION BY THE UNION
GOVER NMENT, THE SUBJECT OCCUPIED THE EARNEST CONSIDERATION
OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION WAS PASSED:
"’SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN CONGRESS EXECUTIVE AS
REPRESENTING THE INDIAN COMMUNITY OF SOUTH AFRICA
DEEPLY DEPLORES CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE UNION
GOVERNMENT UPON THE CONTEMPLATED VISIT OF THE ALI
BROTHERS TO THE UNION, AND HEREBY REQUESTS THE AGENT OF
THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TO TAKE ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS
FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL SUCH CONDITIONS.’"
272Moulana Mohamed Ali and Moulana Shaukat Ali, then prominent nationalist leaders of India, were
invited by the Cape British Indian Council. The Union Government imposed conditions on the visit, such
as that they should undertake not to discuss political matters of any kind.
The two Moulanas then decided not to visit the Union.We know now what the result of the Agent’s interv ention has been. The obstinate refusal
of the Union Government to waive the restrictions, especially in view of the unsolicited
and gentlemanly assurance of the Ali Brothers not to engage in any political controversy
or discussion during their sojourn in S outh Africa, shows in what estimate even the
Government of India is held by the Union Government. That estimate will persist so long
as the Government of India is an irresponsible Government and therefore remains a body
whose wishes can be flouted with imp unity by any foreign Government, whether it may
be one occupying the Dominion Status or one wholly unconnected with Great Britain. I
fear that we will have to submit to such humiliation so long as we, through our own
disunion, dissensions and the like, rem ain impotent and powerless to help ourselves.

156. LETTER TO THE REV. C. F. ANDREWS, APRIL 19, 1931
...And now for the Transvaal question. It is becoming more and more difficult da y after
day. Unless India comes to her own in the near future, I see no prospect of improvement
in the situation. Of course the resident Indian population will somehow drag on its
existence there. They have sufficient resourcefulness but it would be living from hand to
mouth. However we must do all we can. Yours I know is just now the largest share. I
have become almost incapacitated for that work. But when we meet we must discuss the
situation and I might be able to find out some effective method of dealin g with it...

157. REPATRIATES FROM SOUTH AFRICA
Pandit Benarsidas Chaturvedi and Swami Bhawani Dayal Sannyasi have prepared a well -
reasoned report of an independent enquiry they held into the condition of emig rants
repatriated to India under the assisted emigration scheme from South Africa.273This
report and the Swami’s telegram dated 16th ultimo, asking me to comment on it, telling
me, "Condition worst, many starving, women half naked, children begging," have l ain
with me ever since. I am sorry that I have not been able to deal with the report earlier.
The telegram from which I have quoted is an epitome of the report. The condition of our
people, who find themselves strangers in their own land, is a disgrace ali ke to us and to
the Government, but more to us than to the Government. No Government in the world
can cope fully with such cases. Governments can only support to a limited extent
voluntary public effort in such cases. It is really up to the merchant prince s and other
employers of labour in Calcutta to take a real interest in the welfare of such people, and
find suitable employment for them.
273A Repo rt on the Emigrants Repatriated to India under the Assisted Emigration Scheme from South
Africa and on the Problem of Returned Emigrants from all Colonies , May 15, 1931But the condition of these people is a small consideration, compared with the cause that
has reduced those repatriat es to the condition in which they find themselves. There
should have been no agreed repatriation at all, and if there was to be any, there should
have been ample provision previously made to ensure proper occupation for them, and in
any case there should n ever have been any consent to the repatriation of colonial -born
Indians, of whom there are fully thirty -three percent in the Calcutta depot. But it is no use
crying over spilt milk. The labours of the framers of the report will not have been in vain
if atthe time of the revision of the Cape Agreement, the rights of the poor labouring
Indian population are not bartered away for doubtful concessions to the other Indian
settlers. The position taken up by the latter is unassailable, and should depend on its ow n
merits. The settlers themselves should therefore refuse to be party to any bargain, which
would compromise the rights of their less favourably situated brethren. South Africa can
easily absorb and accommodate the existing Indian population.

158. REMINISCENCES OF IMAM BAWAZEER274
Imam Saheb went to South Africa about the same year as I (1893). His real name was
Abdul Kadir Bawazeer, but, as he served as Imam in South Africa, most people k new him
asImam Saheb . I always addressed him by that name.
TheImam Sahib ’s father was the Muezzin of the famous Jumma Masjid in Bombay and
served in that capacity right till his death. He died only a few years ago, after the Imam
Sahib ’s return to Indi a. He fell dead just as he was washing and getting ready for the
azan .275Such a death comes only to the blessed. The Imam Sahib ’s forefathers were
Arabs and had come to India and settled in the Konkan years ago. Hence he knew the
Konkani language too. His m other tongue was Gujarati, but he had little schooling. He
knew Arabic well enough to be able to read from the Koran Sharif with a pleasing
intonation, though not so well as to be able to understand everything in the Koran . He
had picked up, through contac ts in practical life, English, Dutch and Creole French. Urdu,
of course, he knew. He had also a working knowledge of Zulu. His intellect was so sharp
that, if he had regularly studied in a school, he would have earned reputation as a great
scholar. Though he was not a lawyer, he had come to understand subtleties of law
through practical experience.
TheImam Saheb had gone to South Africa for trade and had earned much. When he gave
up business, he kept coaches which he supplied on hire and had a fairly goo d income
from that calling. Being a man of independent temper, he never tried his fortune in big
business. He had a sweet voice, and, since his father was a Muezzin , he occasionally
274Letters to the inmates of the Ashram , March 7, 14 and 21, 1932
275Call to the fait hfulofficiated as Imam in the mosque in Johannesburg. But he accepted no honor arium for his
services.
TheImam Saheb had married twice. Both the wives were Malays. His first marriage was
not successful, and so he married the lady whom we knew as his wife. This marriage had
given him much happiness. He and the Haji Saheba served ea ch other with great
devotion. He was a sincere friend. So far as I know, the Imam Sahib ’s views about
marriage had undergone a complete change and he had come to believe in monogamy...
My first meeting with Imam Saheb may be said to have taken place in 1 903 in South
Africa after my return to that country. He used to tell me that we had met once before that
but I have no recollection of that meeting. When I set up practice as a lawyer in
Johannesburg, he used to accompany clients to my office. He was an al together different
man then in appearance and manners. He used to dress himself in English style, and wore
a Turkish cap. I immediately recognised his intelligence, but otherwise he did not
produce a good impression on me at first. I thought him rather obs tinate, but, as I came to
know him better, I liked him more and more.
I saw, as I had more and more experience of dealing with him, that what I had thought to
be obstinacy was only his eagerness to understand fully the implications of every point. If
heheld an opinion on any matter, he would not give it up till his reason was convinced of
his error. He would not take a lawyer’s word as gospel truth in legal matters merely
because he himself was not a lawyer, but would argue against him even in such matte rs.
Though he had had no education, he had complete confidence in his judgement.
Moreover, he had a proud sense of self -respect. I, therefore, saw very soon that he had
sufficient strength of mind to cling to his own view without being overawed by anybody.
In the beginning, Imam Saheb used to come to me on behalf of clients and explain their
cases to me. But he took interest in current affairs and would draw me into discussion
about them. He evinced keen interest in discussing the hardships of our country men in
South Africa and took part in the meetings, etc. On most issues, he supported me, but he
never hesitated to oppose me even in public whenever he did not approve of my stand.
Gradually, however, he was drawn towards me and, when the satyagraha commen ced,
proved himself as steadfast as a rock. Some fell and some weakened, and some opposed
me bitterly, but I don’t remember Imam Saheb to have wavered at any time. When he was
imprisoned for the first time, nobody expected that he would remain strong till the end.
On the contrary, many persons told me, including some who held him in high respect,
that he would not go to jail again, that he had a delicate constitution, was pleasure -loving
and had many wants. This was on the whole true. However, Imam Saheb never weakened,
whereas I saw many who were known to be simple in their habits withdrawing from the
struggle. Imam Sahib ’s capacity for self -sacrifice was very great, and, though he would
think long before taking a decision, he showed wonderful strength in c linging to a
decision once taken.
When Imam Saheb plunged into the struggle, he had no thought at all that he would have
to break up his home and embrace a life of complete renunciation. As soon, however, ashe saw that if he wished to remain staunch in thesatyagraha movement he would have to
give up the attachment to his home, he did so almost in an instant. This was no small
sacrifice on his part.
We should remember that Imam Saheb had set up his home in English style. Haji Saheba
had lived in that s tyle from her very birth. Fatima and Amina also were brought up like
English children. For one who had lived in this manner, it was extremely difficult to
curtail his heavy expenditure and adopt an utterly simple mode of life. For Imam Saheb ,
however, once he had made up his mind to do a particular thing, it was quite easy to carry
out his resolve. And, therefore, when I decided to leave Johannesburg and to settle in
Phoenix, he himself proposed that he, too, would live there.276Though I knew his
firmness of mind, I was completely at a loss what to say in reply to his proposal. I
described to him the hardships of life in Phoenix. A man who had never put his body to
the slightest trouble and had always lived surrounded by comforts and luxuries, I
wondered how such a person would be able to start forthwith living like a labourer. Even
if he himself could bear the hardships of life in Phoenix, what about Haji Saheba , and
Fatima and Amina, I asked. Imam Sahib ’s reply was brief. He said: "I have put my trust
in God . And you do not know Haji Saheba . She will always be ready to live where I live,
and as I live. If, therefore, you have no other difficulty in the matter, I have decided to
come and live in Phoenix. No one knows when the struggle will end. I don’t think I shall
be able to carry on my old business of supplying coaches on hire, or take up any other
occupation. Like you, I too have realised that a satyagrahi should give up love of wealth
and possessions." Imam Sahib ’s proposal pleased me very much. I wrote to my co -
workers in Phoenix. They also welcomed the proposal. And so Imam Saheb and his
family came over.
Many inmates of Ashram probably do not know that Imam Saheb joined the residents of
Phoenix in all their activities. Everybody fetched water for his o r her own use from a
spring below. It flowed at some depth below the level of the Phoenix Settlement. The
Phoenix buildings were on a hill and one had to climb about fifty feet to reach the place.
Imam Saheb had a delicate constitution even at that time, b ut every morning one saw him
walking down to the spring with a kavad277on his shoulders and climbing up slowly with
the buckets filled with water. The place now occupied by the spinning -wheel in the
Ashram was held in Phoenix by the printing press. All the inmates, boys and girls, old
men and women, educated and uneducated, had to work in some department of the press.
There were all kinds of big or small tasks, composing, folding the printed copies of the
paper, making wrappers, pasting stamps, moving the wh eel with the hand whenever the
machine stopped, etc., etc. Everybody was required to give some time and help in these
tasks, especially on the day on which the journal was to be published. Imam Saheb ,Haji
Saheba , Fatima and Amina, all four of them joined in this work. Imam Saheb had learned
composing. For a man of his temper and habits and of his age, this was indeed wonderful.
276Gandhiji closed the Tolstoy Farm in Johannesburg in January 1913 and moved to Phoenix Settlement
near Durban with some passive resisters and their children in the school at Tolstoy Farm.
277Two baskets or vessels suspended from the ends of a stic k carried horizontally over the shouldersIn this way, Imam Saheb identified himself completely with the life at Phoenix. He and
the other members of his family were non -vegetarian, but I don’t remember any time
when they cooked such food at Phoenix.
This, however, does not mean that Imam Saheb was in any way a less devout Muslim. He
never missed namaz , nor did he or his family ever fail to observe the roza. By adopting
the manner of life of the other inmates and making a sacrifice for their sake, he really
demonstrated the nobility of Islamic culture.
Imam Sahib ’s capacity for self -sacrifice was to be put to a still more severe test. He went
to jail again several times, and proved himself a model prisoner. When, however, in the
year 1914 it was decided that most of the inmates of the Ashram should return to India,
leaving only a few of them in Phoenix, Imam Saheb was put to a real test. South Africa
had practically become his home. Haji Saheba , Fatima and Amina were complete
strangers to India and did not know any Indian language -a little English and Dutch was
all the language that they knew. But Imam Saheb took no time to come to a decision. He
had made up his mind that he and his family would live wherever I did. That was his self -
sacrifice for the cause of satyagraha and his contribution towards Hindu -Muslim unity...

159. SPEECH AT TEMPERA NCE ASSOCIATION, BANGALORE, JANUARY 7,
1934
...When as a young man I went to South Africa, I observed that the coolies, indentured
Indians, were fast going down owing to the drink habit. The law in South Africa made it
a crime for indentured Indians to ca rry drink home. They could drink as much as they
liked at the canteen. The result was that many women were found literally lying in gutters.
It was not a thing of which any Indian could be proud. I pleaded with the Government,
but mine was a voice in the w ilderness. So the thing went on. But it made a lasting
impression on my mind. I knew what I had to do when I came to India after a long exile.
I am not a temperance man. I am a prohibition man. I fought with my countrymen in
South Africa and said, "We sh ould not fight for an equal right to drink." I could not
persuade them for a long time, but I did succeed in persuading a majority of them that to
fight for rights was one thing and to fight for indulgence in vice was another...

Dear Sir Purushottamdas,You will please explain to the South African delegation my sincere regret over my
inability to welcome them in person.278Apart from convalescence it is difficult for me to
tear myself away from my new home, Segaon. I pray to God that this visit may result in
removing cobwebs of misunderstanding and bringing the two countries closer together.

Dear Mr. Hofmeyer,
It was a great pleasure to receive your warm letter. I do hope you are having a profitable
time in this land and that you find the people you meet to be hospitable.
Itwill be a matter of regret to me that although you have so many friends in India, we
may not meet at all.
You may be interested to know that the paper I am writing on is hand -made written with
a village reed pen. You ought not to leave India without see ing some typical villages. Of
course it is foolish of me to expect you to visit Wardha and Segaon and glance at the
humble effort we are making.
With kind regards to you and fellow members,
Yours sincerely,

278A South African Parliamentary delegation, consisting of eleven members of Parliament, led by J. H.
Hofmeyer, Union Minister of the Interior, visited India for 26 days.
Sir Purushottamdas, a businessman who had taken a special interest in Indians overseas, handed over the
letter of Gandhiji to Mr. Hofmeyer on arrival of the delegation in Bombay on September 19, 1936.PART V
1938 -41
Editors’ Note
This section covers but four years. And yet a more active period of time can scarcely be
imagined.
The clouds of war hovered over the world menacingly, while nationalist opinion in India
reached fever pitch. Congress ministries were in office in some Provinces in India, a
distinct gain in Indian self -governance. But the Congress and Muslim League had drifted
apart, a distinct loss to Indian self -sufficiency. The League alleged injustices on Muslims
in Congres s-governed provinces, while parties representing extreme Hindu opinion
criticised Gandhiji and the Congress bitterly for "pandering to Muslim intransigence" and
"betraying Hindu interests." A communal riot shook Bombay, capital of the Congress -
governed pre sidency, in 1938.
The political air was incendiary, both within India and further afield. Suspicions
governed the relationship between the Viceroy and his Executive Council on the one
hand and the Congress and Muslim League on the other. And between Cong ress and the
Muslim League.
When Britain declared war on Germany, India had not been consulted. The Congress
ministries resigned in protest in 1939. Jinnah and the Muslim League promptly celebrated
the day as a `Day of Deliverance.’ The two -nation theory was now abroad.
Even as Gandhiji tried to keep the principal communities within India together, he
counselled patience and unity to the Indian community in South Africa. Through an All
India Congress Committee resolution passed in June 1939, Gandhiji exp ressed trust "that
there will be no dissensions among them (Indians of South Africa) and that they will
present a united front." (Item 173). And even as he tried, in vain, to persuade the British
Government in India to obtain Indian co -operation in the war effort by offering
independence at the end of the war, he sought to obviate a campaign of passive resistance
by getting the Union Government to conciliate the community.
A new generation of leaders was emerging in South Africa. They denounced the offici als
of Indian organisations for constantly seeking compromises with the government as it
proceeded to impose more and more humiliating laws. The new leaders -radicals and
Communists as well as followers of Gandhiji's ideas -called for a militant struggle
against discrimination and humiliation. They sought co -operation with the Africans and
others oppressed by the regime. They were inspired by the national movement in India
and the anti -fascist movement in Europe.
Gandhiji was approached in May 1939 by D r. Yusuf M. Dadoo and Manilal Gandhi for
blessings and guidance to passive resistance in the Transvaal. A meeting of the Indianpeople in the Transvaal had decided on passive resistance against the Asiatics (Transvaal
Land and Trading) Bill, rejecting the advice of the leaders of the Transvaal Indian
Congress. Dr. Dadoo, who moved the proposal, was subsequently chosen leader of a
Council of Action.
Gandhiji was encouraged by the spirit of sacrifice of Dr. Dadoo and his colleagues.
(Items 182, 186). He gav e moral support to passive resistance and ensured a resolution by
the All India Congress Committee assuring its support.
Chiding the Union Government for its lack of finality in policy with respect of Indians,
Gandhiji said:
"Evidently the Union Govern ment would not be happy till they have either driven
away Indians whom they have given legislative protection to or reduced their status to
such an extent that no self -respecting Indian would care to remain in South Africa."
(Harijan , May 27, 1939). (Item 170).
In an impassioned cable to Smuts on July 16, 1939, Gandhiji asked : "You have great
power. Must you use it against a handful who have done Union no injury?" (Item 178).
As in the past, the prospect of another satyagraha persuaded the Indian Gover nment to
move. It informed Gandhiji that negotiations had been initiated with South Africa, with
British support, and there was hope of an honourable compromise.
At the same time as Gandhiji counselled Dadoo to postpone passive resistance, planned
to com mence on August 1, 1939, he pressed the Government of India to act. A succession
of communications to South Africa show Gandhiji's anxious exertions: "Delicate
negotiations proceeding" (July 25, 1939, to Dadoo). (Item 181). "I have put myself in
touch with the Ministers" (July 29, 1939, press statement). (Item 182). "There is a ray of
hope that we shall reach a settlement" (August 19, 1939, to Dadoo). (Item 186). "I have
been staying their hand. But they are getting restive. They won't be satisfied with any
patchwork settlement." (August 21, 1939, to Member, Viceroy's Executive Council).
(Item 187). "Making effort" (August 28, 1939, to Dadoo). (Item 188). "Trying my best"
(September 19, 1939, to S.B. Medh). (Item 190). "Advise patience" (October 23, 1939, to
Dadoo). (Item 192). "Suggest you invite Dadoo see you" (October 23, 1939, to Smuts).
(Item 193).
Gandhiji anticipated a long and difficult struggle. (Letter to Manilal and Sushila Gandhi,
August 21, 1938; Collected Works , Volume 70, page 109). He inform ed Dr. Dadoo that
he did not expect anything substantial from the negotiations, but suggested that any
possibility for an honourable compromise should be explored. He said that too much had
already been surrendered in past years and that the struggle would be very hard. He
hoped that a handful of Indians at least would make it a mission of their life to serve the
cause of the Indian community. (Item 186).In the meantime, he helped Dr. Dadoo and his Passive Resistance Committee to be
recognised by the Ind ian Agent -General and the South African Government. (Items 187
and 193).
The diplomatic efforts by the Indian Government proved fruitless and the Second World
War intervened. Gandhiji wrote to Dr. Dadoo on December 13, 1939:
"If you can tide over the w ar period, it will be good. But I can imagine a situation
when submission would be unmanly..." (Item 195).
There was only a token passive resistance in 1941.
Gandhiji was in prison from August 1942 for launching the "Quit India" movement, and
there occ urs another gap in his statements on South Africa.
162. MESSAGE TO INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA, JUNE 6, 1938
I can give only one message to the Indians in South Africa. We shall never be able to
preserve our self -respect in South Africa without self -sacrifice. There can be no such
distinctions as Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Madrasis, Gujaratis or Punjabis.

163. INTERVIEW TO THE REV. S.S. TEMA, JANUARY 1, 1939279
TEMA: How can my peop le make their Congress as successful as the Indian National
Congress?
GANDHIJI: The Congress became successful for the simple reason that it was
inaugurated by the most selfless and cultured people that could be found in that age. They
made themselves th e representatives of the people and captured their imagination by
reason of service and self -sacrifice. They were from the people and of the people. You
have not, as far as I am aware, a band of Africans who would be content to work and live
in impecuniosi ty. Among those who are educated there is not that absolute selflessness.
Again, while most of your leaders are Christians, the vast mass of the Bantus and Zulus
are not Christians. You have adopted European dress and manners, and have as a result
become s trangers in the midst of your own people. Politically, that is a disadvantage. It
makes it difficult for you to reach the heart of the masses. You must not be afraid of
279Sent through Manilal Gandhi who was returning to South Africabeing "Bantuised" or feel ashamed of carrying an assegai or of going about with only a
tiny clout round your loins. A Zulu or a Bantu is a well -built man and need not be
ashamed of showing his body. He need not dress like you. You must become Africans
once more.
T:Of late there has been some talk of forming an Indo -African united non -white front in
South Africa. What do you think about it?
G: It will be a mistake. You will be pooling together not strength but weakness. You will
best help one another by each standing on his own legs. The two cases are different. The
Indians are a microsco pic minority. They can never be a menace to the white population.
You, on the other hand, are the sons of the soil who are being robbed of your inheritance.
You are bound to resist that. Yours is a far bigger issue. It ought not to be mixed up with
that of the Indian. This does not preclude the establishment of the friendliest relations
between the two races. The Indians can co -operate with you in a number of ways. They
can help you by always acting on the square towards you. They may not put themselves
inopposition to your legitimate aspirations, or run you down as "savages" while exalting
themselves as cultured people in order to secure concessions for themselves at your
expense.
T:What sort of relations would you favour between these two races?
G: The closest possible. But while I have abolished all distinction between an African
and an Indian, that does not mean that I do not recognise the difference between them.
The different races of mankind are like different branches of a tree -once we recogni se
the common parent stock from which we are sprung, we realise the basic unity of the
human family, and there is no room left for enmities and unhealthy competition.
T:Should we adopt violence or non -violence as a means for our deliverance?
G: Certai nly, non -violence under all circumstances. But you must have a living faith in it.
Even when there is impenetrable darkness surrounding you, you must not abandon hope.
A person who believes in non -violence believes in a living God. He cannot accept defeat.
Therefore, my advice is non -violence all the time, but non -violence of the brave, not of
the coward.
T:Your example has shed so much influence upon us that we are thinking whether it
would not be possible for one or two of our young men, who we are hop ing will become
leaders, to come to you for training.
G: It is quite a good and sound idea.
T:Do you think Christianity can bring salvation to Africa?
G: Christianity, as it is known and practised today, cannot bring salvation to your people.
It ismy conviction that those who today call themselves Christians do not know the truemessage of Jesus. I witnessed some of the horrors that were perpetrated on the Zulus
during the Zulu Rebellion. Because one man, Bambatta, their chief, had refused to pay
his tax, the whole race was made to suffer.280
I was in charge of an ambulance corps. I shall never forget the lacerated backs of Zulus
who had received stripes and were brought to us for nursing because no white nurse was
prepared to look after them. And ye t those who perpetrated all those cruelties called
themselves Christians. They were educated, better dressed than the Zulus, but not their
moral superiors.
T:Whenever a leader comes up in our midst, he flops down after a while. He either
becomes ambitio us after money or succumbs to the drink habit or some other vice and is
lost to us. How shall we remedy this?
G: The problem is not peculiar to you. Your leadership has proved ineffectual because it
was not sprung from the common people. If you belong to the common people, live like
them and think like them, they will make common cause with you. If I were in your place,
I would not ask a single African to alter his costume and make himself peculiar. It does
not add a single inch to his moral stature.

164. INTERVIEW TO SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN STUDENTS281
"What should we, South Africa -borns, do to preserve our Indian culture in our
country of adoption? " they asked Gandhiji. " What other l anguages would you ask us
to learn besides English? "
Gandhiji answered by first twitting them for giving the first place to English. He advised
them instead to learn Hindustani, which should contain all words of Sanskritic as well as
Persian or Arabic or igin that are used by the man in the street. The Hindus dared not
neglect the study of Sanskrit nor the Muslims of Arabic, not only because the study of
these languages was necessary to give them access to their scriptures in the original, but
also because these two tongues contained the grandest poetry that the world has ever
produced. He concluded:
280In 1906, Bambatta (Bambata ), a Zulu chief, refused to pay a new poll tax imposed on the Zulus. The tax
was onerous £1 on each adult when the average annual wage of an African was £5. A tax collector was
killed and a widespread rebellion followed.
The Natal Government sent troops into the area and suppressed the rebellion after 4,000 Africans and 30
whites were killed. Another 4,000 Africans were arrested and sentenced to brutal lashings.
281The students, who were in India to pursue medical studies, met Gandhiji in Bardoli sometim e before
February 6, 1939."But above all you should jealously retain the essential simplicity and spirituality
which is the hallmark of Indian culture."
Their other question was whe ther they should carry on the struggle for their rights in
South Africa through satyagraha or through constitutional agitation.
Gandhiji: "If the South African Indian community had guts in them, I would say
satyagraha , and they are bound to win. I am hop ing that some day from among Indian
youths born in South Africa a person will rise who will stand up for the rights of his
countrymen domiciled there, and make the vindication of those rights his life’s mission.
He will be so pure, so cultured, so truthful and so dignified in his bearing that he will
disarm all opposition. The whites will then say, 'If all Indians were like him, we should
have no objection to giving them an equal status with us`. But he will answer, 'It is not
enough that there is one repre sentative of the Indian community whom you are ready to
recognise as your equal. What I am, other countrymen of mine too can be, if instead of
calling them names and putting them under all sorts of disabilities you give them a
sporting chance in the matter of educational and other facilities which are today denied
them`. Such a one, when he appears, will not need to be coached by me. He will assert
himself by his sheer genius."

April 7, 1939
I hope that you will have a successful meeting. There is no doubt that the proposed
measure,283if it becomes law of the Union of South Africa, will mean slow death of the
Indian community in the Transvaa l. It is the fashion of the day to condemn many of
Hitler’s acts as so many breaches of pacts. What is it if the proposed measure is not an
attempt to commit a flagrant breach of the Cape Town Settlement of 1914 and subsequent
declarations of the Union Gov ernment?

Earlier, on March 15, 1939, Dr. Dadoo and S.B. Medh had sent a letter to Gandhiji describing the series of
anti-Indian measures enacted in South Africa. They informed Gandhiji that at a mass meeting of Transvaal
Indians on March 1, 1939, a prop osal, moved by Dr. Dadoo, calling for passive resistance in the event of
the segregation bill (servitude scheme) being introduced in Parliament, was adopted. The community, they
said, was by an overwhelming majority in favour of passive resistance.Brindaban

Gandhiji said that he was deeply grieved that the Union Government seemed to have no
finality about their policy in respect of Asiatics. Their past declarations were b eing
disregarded and some of the recommendations made by their own Commissions were
also being set at naught.
There was no wonder, he said, that a section of British Indian settlers in South Africa
resented this policy and in despair were thinking of reso rting to civil disobedience.287
He could only hope that wiser counsels would prevail and that the Union Government
would retrace their steps and respect the rights acquired by British Indian settlers.

170. THE LATE ST MENACE
Rajkot,
May 23, 1939
It has been a matter of grief to me that the Union Government have not respected their
own agreement regarding their treatment of British Indians. There has been a policy of
progressive stringency in their anti -Asiatic drive. One had hoped that what is known as
the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement of 1914 was the last word in this matter. It was also hoped
287Ata large mass meeting organised by the Nationalist Group of the Transvaal Indian Congress in
Johannesburg on May 7, 1939, under the chairmanship of E. I. Asvat, it was decided to launch passive
resistance if the Asiatics (Transvaal Land and Trading) Bill be came law. Dr. Dadoo was elected leader of a
Passive Resistance Council of 25 members.
At a subsequent mass meeting on July 9, 1939, passive resistance was planned to begin on August 1, 1939.that with virtual restriction of Indian immigration, there would be progressive
amelioration in the condition of domiciled Ind ians. But that hope was dashed to pieces.
Much deterioration has taken place since then. There have been Round Table and other
conferences, agreements have been reached, but never has finality been felt by the
Indians. Evidently the Union Government would not be happy till they have either driven
away Indians whom they have given legislative protection or reduced their status to such
an extent that no self -respecting Indian would care to remain in South Africa. I have
therefore not discountenanced their rep orted decision to fight this latest menace of
segregation through civil resistance if necessary. There must be perfect cohesion and
union among the Indians who are divided into groups. And their resistance will be vain if
they are not resolute in self -suffering. Public opinion in India including that of Europeans
will, I hope, back the Indians in their unequal fight and call upon the Indian Government
to exert its influence with the Union Government. Lastly, I appeal to the best mind of
South Africa288to see that simple justice is not denied to the Indian settlers who have
done no wrong to the country of their adoption.

... The A.I.C.C. regrets the attitude of the Union Government towards Indian settlers. It
betrays utter disregard of the obligations undertaken by the predecessors of the present
Government. The policy just initiated by them is in direct breach of the Smuts -Gandhi
Agreement of 1914, the Cape T own Agreement of 1927, the Feetham Commission of
1932293and the subsequent undertakings on behalf of the Union Government. The
A.I.C.C. notes with pride and satisfaction the firm stand taken up by the Indians of South
Africa. They will have the sympathy of the whole Indian nation behind them in their fight
for self -respect and honourable existence. The A.I.C.C. trusts that there will be no
dissensions among them and that they will present a united front. The A.I.C.C. appeals to
the Union Government to retrac e their steps and carry out the promises of their
predecessors to adopt a policy of progressive amelioration in the status of the Indian
nationals in South Africa, 80 percent of whom are born and bred in that sub -continent and
to whom South Africa is their only home.

175. DR. LOHIA'S AMENDMENT TO SOUTH AFR ICA RESOLUTION OF THE
ALL INDIA CONGRESS COMMITTEE
It is a matter of congratulation that the South Africa resolution of the A.I.C.C. escaped
complete disfigurement which the learned Dr. Lohia's amendment would have caused. I
tender him my thanks for havin g listened to Pandit Jawaharlal's advice to respect the
opinion of an expert like me who had passed the best part of his life in South Africa and
who had not lost touch with that great country after retiring from it.296
This incident is an illustration sho wing that mere learning, mere humanitarianism
divorced from actual experience may spell disaster to the cause sought to be espoused. Dr.
Lohia's amendment had as much place in the resolution of mine as mine would have in a
resolution framed by him as an au thority on socialism to meet a socialist difficulty. If I
294Please see previous item for the text of the A.I.C.C. resolution.
295Please see footnote to item 167 above.
296Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, a Socialist leader and secretary of the Foreign Department of the All India
Congress Committee, 1936 -38, moved an amendment to the resolution on South Africa to urge the Indians
to co -operate with the Africans and present a united front in opposing the segregation policy. The
amendment was carried.
The resolution was, however, reconsidered when Gandhiji indicated that the amendment would not be
appropriate as the resolution concerned prop osed civil resistance by Indians against measures which
affected them alone, and was based on the undertakings given to the Indian community.
It was then passed without the amendment.made any such attempt, he would very properly say, "Don’t pass the resolution if you
don’t like it, but don’t disfigure it. It would defeat the purpose for which it is framed"...
Having said this let me say for the information of Dr. Lohia and his fellow humanitarians
that I yield to no one in my regard for the Zulus, the Bantus and the other races of South
Africa. I used to enjoy intimate relations with many of them. I had the privilege of often
advising them. It used to be my constant advice to our countrymen in South Africa, never
to exploit or deceive these simple folk. But it was not possible to amalgamate the two
causes. The rights and privileges (if any could be so called) of the indigenous i nhabitants
are different from those of the Indians. So are their disabilities and their causes. But if I
discovered that our rights conflicted with their vital interests, I would advise the
foregoing of those rights. They are the inhabitants of South Afric a as we are of India. The
Europeans are undoubtedly usurpers, exploiters or conquerors or all these rolled into one.
And so the Africans have a whole code of laws specially governing them. The Indian
segregation policy of the Union Government has nothing i n common with the policy
governing the African races. It is unnecessary for me to go into details. Suffice it to say
that ours is a tiny problem compared to the vast problem that faces the African races and
that affects their progress. Hence it is not poss ible to speak of the two in the same breath.
The A.I.C.C. resolution concerns itself with the civil resistance struggle of our
countrymen on a specific issue applicable solely to them. It is now easy to see that Dr.
Lohia's amendment, if it had remained, w ould have been fatal to the resolution which
would have become perfectly meaningless. The appeal to the Union Government would
have lost all its point.
But good often comes out of evil. The amendment, wisely withdrawn, shows to the
Africans and to the wo rld in general that India has great regard and sympathy for all the
exploited races of the earth and that she would not have a single benefit at the expense of
the vital interest of any of them. Indeed the war against imperialism cannot wholly
succeed unle ss all exploitation ceases. The only way it can cease is for every exploited
race or nation to secure freedom without injuring any other.
My examination of the South Africa resolution would be incomplete if I did not warn the
Indians in South Africa agai nst building much on the resolution itself. It is a potent
resolution only if the Indians take the contemplated action. The motherland will not be
able to protect their self -respect, if they are not prepared to protect it themselves. They
must therefore be ready to suffer for it. The struggle may be prolonged, suffering great.
But they will have the moral backing of the whole nation. In this Hindus, Muslims, and
all political parties including Europeans are united. The Government of India may feel
powerless . I fancy they are not so powerless as they imagine. I am reminded of the
"Thought for the Day" in the Times of India of the 24th instant. It begins, "We have more
power than will." I know their sympathy is with the Indians. If they have the strength of
will, they have the power. Our countrymen in South Africa know the conditions of
satyagraha . The foremost condition is unity among themselves.
To the Union Government I would say, "You have never proved your case. Your best
men have admitted that there is no difficulty in your absorbing the two hundred thousandIndians in your continent. They are but a drop in the ocean. Remember that 80 percent of
them are born in South Africa. They have adopted your manners, customs and costume.
They are intelligent. They have the same feelings and emotions that you have. They
deserve better treatment than to be regarded untouchables fit only to be relegated to
ghettos. This is not playing the game. And you should not wonder if, at last, Indians say,
‘We shall rather die i n your jails than live in your segregation camps.’ I am sure you do
not want to go to all that length. Let it not be said of you that you had no respect for your
promises."

176. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, JULY 8, 1939297
I have carefully read Sir Raza Ali’s condemnation of my advice to Indians in South
Africa not to embark upon a non -European front. My advice may be bad on merits but
does not become bad because I have been absent from South Africa for a quarter of a
century. I have no doubt about the soundness of my advice. However much one may
sympathise with the Bantus, Indians cannot make common cause with them. I doubt if the
Bantus themselves will as a class count enance any such move. They can only damage
and complicate their cause by mixing it up with the Indian, as Indians would damage
theirs by such mixture. But neither the A.I.C.C. resolution nor my advice need deter the
Indians from forming a non -European fron t if they are sure thereby of winning their
freedom. Indeed, had they thought it beneficial or possible, they would have formed it
long ago.298

297According to The Hindu (July 9, 1939), Gandhiji made this statemen t "on being shown Sir Raza Ali`s
statement on A.I.C.C. resolution regarding South Africa."
Sir Syed Raza Ali had told the Associated Press of India that the "A.I.C.C. had made a serious blunder by
deleting from the resolution the passage supporting the n on-European front," as that was likely to
encourage the Union Government in pursuing its anti -Indian policy.
Criticising Gandhiji’s statement in the Harijan (please see previous item), he said: "The trouble is that
Mahatmaji's knowledge (of South Africa) is quarter of a century old." (Quoted by A. C. Meer in The
Leader , Durban, August 1, 1986).

Resistance Committee in South Africa. I have no hesitation in asking the Passive
Resistance Committee to postpone, for a time, the proposed launching of the struggle on
1st August. I do so becau se I have some hope of an honourable settlement. I know that
the Government of India as well as the British Government are trying to obtain relief. I
have put myself in touch with the Ministers. In the circumstances I think a brief
postponement of the stru ggle to be necessary. I am fully aware of the enthusiasm of the
resisters. They have proved their mettle before, and they will do so again if it becomes
necessary. But it is a code with passive resisters to seize every opportunity of avoiding
resistance, i f it can be done honourably. Every cessation in search of peace adds strength
to real fighters. Let them remember that the Cape Town Settlement of 1914 was the
outcome of a cessation of struggle for the sake of peace. I hope that the proposed
cessation wil l lead to a similar result. Should it unfortunately prove otherwise and should
the struggle begin, let Dr. Dadoo and his fellow -resisters know that the whole of India
will be at their back.302

Whether our countrymen in South Africa have to take up passive resistance or not, there

ranks and act as one man and act unselfishly. Their corporate existence cannot be
maintained with honour, if individuals in order to serve their selfish ends compromise the
community’s interest and honour. There is, at the time of writing these lines, a cleavage
between the local Congress and the passive resisters. The resisters seem to have the bulk
of the Indian population with them. But the name and prestige of the South African
Indian Congress is with the non -resisters. Now there is a prospe ct of a lawsuit over the
possession of the Congress books, funds and offices. I would warn the resisters against
falling into the legal trap. Let them follow my example. The equivalent to the Congress in
my days was the British Indian Association.305
From the very commencement of passive resistance, I recognised that all Indians would
not and could not join the struggle although all might be, as they actually were, in
sympathy with it. Although it was open to me, being secretary, to utilise the name and
prestige of the Association, I founded a separate organisation,306leaving the British
Indian Association free to act as it might within constitutional limits. It was possible by
this arrangement to protect the non -resisters from harm, retain their sympathy and save
the resisters from the embarrassment that would undoubtedly be caused by non -resisters
if they were members of the same body. Let the present passive resisters work along their
own lines and rely upon getting more than prestige by their strength, sac rifice and
capacity for suffering. A passive resister should have a generous heart and represent not
only his own companions but even his opponents. Whatever rights he secures, he will
secure for all. He is a friend of all and enemy of none. That is the fi rst condition of
successful passive or civil resistance.

You know that I am watching your movement as closely as I can. You have done well in
sendi ng me the relevant literature. There is just a ray of hope that we shall reach a
settlement. But you will not expect anything heroic nor will you promise great things. If
you have to fight it will be a fight for honour. You won’t get anything very substant ial.
Too much has already been surrendered during these years. You are engaged in a very
hard struggle. And if as a result of the present effort a handful of you make it the mission
of your life to serve the cause there you will gradually build up a presti ge that will stand
you in good stead.

Dear Sir Jagdish,
I know you have been putting up a good fight on behalf of the Indians in S.A. I have been
staying their hand. But they are getting restive. They won’t be satisfied with any patch

therefore doubly necessary not to prolong the agony. If you can, you should tell Rama

parties there. He should take the P.R.'s into his confidence. They complain th at he does
not even recognise them. I can hardly believe this of Rama Rau. I am making inquiry.

I hope things are shaping and proceeding well there.

310A trader in Belfast, Transvaal, active in Indian community associations
311In a letter of November 4, 1939, to Gandhiji, Dr. Dadoo wrote:
"There is no truth whatsoever in the allegation of Haji Ism ail Bhabha. I can assure you that the
satyagrahis remained ever loyal to the principles of non -violence and never for a single moment did
they countenance violent methods. Some Muslim women out of sheer enthusiasm and in complete
accord with the desires an d wishes of the chief members of their households, did attend our meeting. In
my opinion, it was an event of tremendous value to the progress of our community. I shall most
certainly see him but might I proffer a medical opinion, without malice affecting i t, that his mental
stability is open to question. As you rightly say, our duty is to win our opponents by love and
understanding."
He continued as regards the 4 June meeting:
"The Attorney -General has declined to prosecute the accused in June the 4th c ase. They were
committed for trial by the presiding magistrate in a preparatory examination held recently. Legal
opinion declares that a prima facie case was made out. It seems obvious that the Attorney -General was
influenced... by extra -legal consideratio ns. Such are the ways of corrupt society!"
At a public meeting of the Transvaal Indian Congress in Johannesburg on June 4, 1939, supporters of Dr.
Dadoo had been attacked with lethal weapons. Dayabhai Govindji, 25, was killed and several others were
injured. Police arrested five persons who were related to S. M. Nana and A. I. Kajee (secretaries of the
Transvaal and Natal Indian Congresses), but they were not prosecuted.Colle cted Works , Volume 70, page 211

196. DISTURBING NEWS
The news from South Africa is disturbing. Dr. Malan is on the war -path. He will enforce
segregation by law. He will prohibit legal unions between the Whites and Asiatics.315
314This was in reply to a letter of November 4 by Dr. Dadoo explaining the delicate position of the Indian
community in the Transvaal, and adding:
"Since the Passive Resistance Council has postponed the movement on your advice, we look to you for
future guidance. A few of us have taken oath in public that we shall start P.R. if the harmful operation
of the new Act is not stayed. Therefore, I appeal t o you in the event of the Union Government
remaining adamant on this issue, to give us the necessary leave to carry on our struggle. Either an
honourable settlement or P.R. can solve our problems."
315Dr. D.F. Malan, leader of the Nationalist Party, moved in the House of Assembly of the South African
Parliament:
"The House regards it as urgently necessary that the policy of segregation between Europeans and non -
Europeans, residentially, industrially and practically should be carried out without delay and that on
the basis of the report of the Government Commission of 1939 on mixed marriages steps should beHe will tolerate the Indians’ presence only as hewers of wood and drawers of water,
never as human beings having equal opportunities and rights with the Whites. Here in
India, which is daily growing in consciousness of her self -respect and her right to be
regarded as a free nation, this racial bar is resented. India’s independence is coming
sooner than many people think. So far as I can see nothing can stop her march to her
natural de stiny. I myself envisage alliance with Great Britain and the Dominions, if the
freedom is to come as a result of an honourable understanding between the two countries.
But if the statesmen of South Africa continue the attitude of race superiority, alliance
between unequals would become an impossibility. I look upon this war as a divine
judgement. The whole world is directly or indirectly affected by it. Every nation
subordinate or free has to make its choice. Personal wishes of the present actors are likely
to be confounded. I would urge Dr. Malan and those South Africans who think with him
to take a long view of things. He is of course on the right track if he thinks, as many
Africans316do, that God has created the White man to be lord and master of the Colo ured
man. I hope that Dr. Malan is not one of them. Anyway I hope General Smuts will resist
the pressure that is being put upon him to adopt the reactionary legislation suggested by
Dr. Malan.

197. TWO THOUGHT -PROVOKING LETTERS
... The second letter is from South Africa. I take a few sentences from it:
"I am puzzled as to what should be the attitude of Indians at the present juncture. The
‘White’ races a re so utterly callous in regard to ‘Coloured’ people, and in spite of the
war colour prejudice continues unabated. Why then should we give our lives for them?
Quite recently an Indian student who returned here from Europe was telling us that in
spite of th e fact that the steamer was not crowded the British company hesitated to
give accommodation to Indians. Such treatment leads us and also the African people
to believe that there is no difference between the Nazis, the Boers and the British, so
far as we ar e concerned. If there were Nazi rule in South Africa, we could not be
treated worse than we are today. Many of us think that the British are sweet -tongued
but they pursue their own ruthless policy in spite of honeyed words, whereas Hitler
would be more fra nk. He at any rate says exactly what he feels. Is there not truth in
this? Anyhow we ought to know where we stand. Please tell us."
taken to prohibit miscegenation. The House requests the Government, therefore, to introduce
immediately legislation necessary to carry out that policy effectively."
316Presumably "Afrikaners"Though differently worded the two letters betray the same thought. It is difficult for those
who suffer at British hands t o shed either their dislike of or a disinclination to help them.
But the present is a real testing time for ahimsa which alone can throw light on our path.
First of all we must distinguish between the British people and their policy. We must
have full li berty thoughtfully and with reason to criticise the latter, but we may not dislike
them... Let us tell them where they are in the wrong, but let us not wish them any harm.
We may demand a mental and heart change in their outlook, but we may not pray for
their downfall.
Such an attitude is indispensable in satyagraha which demands that, while we may
neither speak evil of wrongdoers nor wish them ill, we must at the same time show them
the error of their ways and non -co-operate with them in their wrongdoing ... The writer
from South Africa rightly says that there is not much to choose between the British and
the Nazis. This is as clear as daylight in South Africa, in particular, where Coloured races
are treated as definitely inferior in every way. What more t han this could the Nazis say or
do? The defeat of the British would connote the victory of the Nazis, which, again, we do
not and must not desire. Therefore, we should be impartial. We are desirous of our own
independence...

318This was in reply to a letter from Sir Shafa’at Ahmed Khan, dated October 7, 1941, informing Gandhiji
that he had been appointed High Commissioner of India in the Union of South Africa. He wished to pay his
respects to Gandhiji before his departure from India, and discuss the problem of Indians in South Africa.PART VI
1945 -48
Editors’ Note
This final section of the volume contains Gandhiji’s comments on South Africa in the last
phase of his life.
The Quit India Movement of 1942 had placed Gandhiji, his wife Kasturba and his
colleagues behind prison bars.
The situation in their Poona jail was to become som bre. In February 1944, Kasturba fell
grievously ill. It became clear, before long, that she was in her deathbed. As life ebbed
away from her fragile body, the events of three decades earlier, in the final phase of the
Satyagraha in South Africa, must have been re -lived by the two prisoners in their
thoughts.
On February 22, 1944, Kasturba, the heroine of the 1913 march into the Transvaal, died.
A prisoner of the British Raj. But a prisoner who had shaken the prison house to its
foundations...
In the mea ntime, the clock was ticking away for the British Raj. Events moved swiftly in
the three years between 1945 and 1948. World War II came to an end as did, in a sense,
India's War of Independence. And just as the former left a divided Germany, the latter
left a divided India. But India was, at last, free.
Gandhiji did not fail, through these momentous events, to remain posted with the latest
developments in South Africa.
A delegation of the South African Indian Congress, led by Sorabjee Rustomjee, arrived in
India in March 1946, as the South African Government proceeded to enact the Asiatic
Land Tenure and Indian Representation Bill, denounced by the Indian community as the
"Ghetto Bill." In a statement dated March 18, 1946, Gandhiji said:
"The threatene d Land and Franchise Bill which has brought the South African
delegation to India, though superficially it affects the Indians of Natal and the
Transvaal, is in effect a challenge to Asia and by implication to the Negro races..."
(Item 202).
On the same day, he said in a cable to General Smuts: "Your Asiatic policy... ill becomes
you... withdraw Land and Franchise Measure and call... RTC (Round Table
Conference)." (Item 203).
And in an article in Harijan dated June 2, 1946, he declared: "The cause is th e cause of
the honour of India and through her of all the exploited coloured races of the earth
whether they are brown, yellow or black." (Item 207).When the Indian community launched passive resistance shortly after, under the
leadership of Dr. Y. M. D adoo and Dr. G. M. Naicker, Gandhiji sent a message to the
Viceroy, Lord Wavell, suggesting he lend support. At his prayer meeting, he expressed
the hope that the passive resisters would prove themselves to be ideal satyagrahis in
every respect. (Item 211) .
Disturbed by reports of white violence against the Satyagrahis , he said in a speech on
June 27, 1946, that the whites there were becoming more and more frenzied in their
hooliganism and seemed to be determined to cow down the satyagrahis who were
behav ing in a calm and dignified manner. (Item 213).
Writing in Harijan , on June 30, 1946, he said: "Let us hope that our countrymen's heroic
resistance will not only shame the hooligans into silence but prove the precursor of the
repeal of the law that disfi gures the statute book of South Africa." (Item 212).
Gandhiji said in his speech to the All India Congress Committee in Bombay on July 7,
1946:
"The South African struggle may appear to be insignificant today but it is charged
with momentous consequenc es." (Item 217)
That statement was to prove prophetic, as the Indian resistance encouraged the African
people and resulted in a defiance campaign of all the oppressed people of South Africa in
1952.
It was more than thirty years since the Smuts -Gandhi Agreement. And more than twenty
years since he wrote Satyagraha in South Africa . But his words at the end of that book
rang true:
"... had it not been for this great struggle and for the untold sufferings which many
Indians invited upon their devoted hea ds, the Indians today would have been hounded
out of South Africa. Nay, the victory achieved by Indians in South Africa more or
less served as a shield for Indian emigrants in other parts of the British empire, who,
if they are suppressed, will be suppress ed thanks to the absence of Satyagraha among
themselves, and to India's inability to protect them, and not because of any flaw in the
weapon of Satyagraha . I will consider myself amply repaid if I have in these pages
demonstrated with some success that Satyagraha is a priceless and matchless weapon,
and that those who wield it are strangers to disappointment or defeat."
Gandhiji was gratified and proud that satyagraha had been revived in the land of its birth.
He said in a speech on July 10, 1946, that it was a matter of pride for India that the
children of indentured labourers and traders -many of them descendants of Harijans -
were proving themselves such brave Satyagrahis . "After all," he remarked, "civil
resistance had its birth in Asia. Jesus was an Asiatic. If he was reborn and went to South
Africa today and lived there, he would have to live in a ghetto." (Item 218).Indian public opinion, which became increasingly sensitive as the country moved towards
independence, pressed for sanctions and othe r strong action against racism in South
Africa. All parties were united on this matter of honour for the country.
Under pressure of public opinion, the Indian Government lodged a complaint with the
United Nations, withdrew its High Commissioner from Sout h Africa and imposed a trade
embargo.
Gandhiji had no doubt that the struggle would be difficult. In May 1947, on the eve of a
major rally organised in Johannesburg, he said he wanted "to warn the organisers of the
rally against rhetorical display or rai sing idle hopes and to advise them to carry on their
demonstration with dignity and restraint." (Item 234).
Dignity and restraint. Those were his chosen attributes for a true satyagrahi . And those
were his own attributes as he walked, on January 30, 1948 , compassionately, but
determinedly, to stop bullets of prejudice in their lethal track. Even two days prior to his
assassination, addressing a prayer congregation at Birla House, New Delhi, he had
reverted to his favourite theme, South Africa.
200. ME SSAGE TO INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA, APRIL 18, 1945319
As India holds the key to the freedom of all the exploited races and nations of the earth so
do Indians in South Africa hold the key to the protection and freedom of the exploited
people in the overseas. F or it was in South Africa that satyagraha was fairly tried and
became largely successful. Will the Indians there unite and sacrifice themselves for the
common cause?

Course of events has raised the question of South Africa Whiteman's policy to the highest
level. Unseen, it holds the seeds of a world war. The threatened Land and Franchise
Bill320which has brought the South African Indian dele gation to India,321though
superficially it affects the Indians of Natal and the Transvaal, is in effect a challenge to
Asia and by implication to the Negro races. India in her present exalted mood can view it
in no other way. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is Indi an to the core but, being also an
internationalist, he has made us used to looking at everything in the international light
instead of the parochial. India, weak physically and materially but strong ethically and
numerically, has proclaimed from the house -tops that her independence would be a threat
to no one and no nation, but will be a help to noble effort throughout the world and a
promise of relief to all its exploited peoples. Therefore India regards the contemplated
measure of the Union of South Afric a as an insult and challenge to them.
The Indian deputation see in the present measure not merely an assault on Indian property
rights but also on their status as free men. They do not want merely to exist in South
Africa. They need not have sent the dep utation all the way to India for that purpose. They
want to be in South Africa as equals of the European settlers of South Africa. They know
that today they are not. But they must stop deterioration and hence move forward. In that
forward march India will help, of course. Indeed all the moral forces will be at their call.
The brunt, however, will have to be borne by them. They rediscovered the force of Truth
(Satyagraha ) and that will be their only and ultimate source of power. Time for it is not
yet. Let u s hope, it will never come. They have to try together322on their side all the
moral forces of the world. They will have to clear the ground of all the weeds, all
sordidness, all personal ambition which always and everywhere creeps in, if sleepless
320The Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Bill, which was introduced in the Parliament of the
Union of South Africa in March 1946.
321The South African Indian Co ngress decided at its Conference in February to oppose the proposed
legislation and to prepare immediately for "concerted and prolonged resistance". A delegation of the
Congress, led by Sorabjee Rustomjee, arrived in India to urge the Indian Government to seek a round table
conference with South Africa and, failing that, to withdraw the High Commissioner from South Africa and
impose economic sanctions against South Africa. The other members of the delegation were S. R. Naidoo,
A. S. M. Kajee and A. A. Mirza .
The delegation was received by the Viceroy, Lord Wavell, on March 12, 1946. It had earlier met Gandhiji
on March 3rd, and he had helped draft the delegation’s memorandum to the Viceroy. For the draft of
Gandhiji, please see Collected Works , Volume 83, pages 230 -31. The text of the memorandum may be
found in Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, The History of the Indian National Congress (Bombay: Padma
Publications, 1947), Volume II, Appendix III.
The resolution of the Working Committee of the Indian National Con gress (March 12 -15, 1946) on
"Indians in South Africa" was probably prepared by Gandhiji.
322Probably "to gather"vigilance is not kept on the watch -tower. Imagine the plight of a poor barque sailing
when the beacon light in front has gone out.
They must be prepared for accidents and consequent suffering. If they are in earnest and
hardy enough to brave the worst, they are b ound to come out the best in the end.
What about the whites of South Africa? They invited the Indians in the first instance. If
they had thought the invitees would always be like slaves or that they would not be
followed by their free brethren, they were soon undeceived.
Does real superiority require outside props in the shape of legislation? Will they see that
every such wall of protection weakens them, ultimately rendering them effeminate? The
lesson of history ought to teach them that might is not ri ght. Right only is might. Field
Marshal Smuts is a great soldier -statesman. Will he not perceive that he will be taking the
whitemen of South Africa down the precipice, if he persists in the policy underlying his
measure? Let him take counsel with the Alli es to whose victory on the battlefield he
contributed not a little. He will surely throw away its fruits, if he persists in his plan of
protecting the civilisation of the West by artificial means.

205. INTERVIEW TO SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION324
Gandhiji remarked on the presence of divisions among them. They admitted divisions but
argued that they were there even in Gandhiji’s time.
AFRICA ACT. TO ALLAY FEARS OF FURTHER PENETRATION BILL PROPOSES
DEMARCATION OF FREE AREAS IN NATAL WHERE INDIANS AND OTHERS CAN BUY
AND OCCUPY LAND FREELY AND QUESTION OF INDIAN SEGREGATION DOES NOT
ARISE. DEMARCATION TO BE MADE BY JOINT BOARDS ON WHICH INDIANS
ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED. ALTHOUGH BILL CURTAILS RIGHTS OF INDIANS TO BUY
AND OCCUPY ANYWHERE IN NATAL IT IS ESSENTIALLY NOT UNFAIR IN INTENTION
OR EFFORT AND WILL PROVIDE WORKABLE BASIS FOR INDIAN DEVELOPMENT AND
RACIAL PEACE FOR MANY YEARS. AS SUCH I COMMEND IT TO YOU WHO KNOW HOW
GREAT ARE THE DIFFICULTIES IN MAINTAINING HARMONY AMONG SOUTH AFRICANS
OF ALL RACES. I ASSURE YOU OF THE FRIENDLY SPIRIT IN WHICH I AM ACTING IN A
SITUATION WHICH MAY EASILY GET OUT OF CON TROL. THIS IS FOR YOUR
INFORMATION AND NOT FOR PUBLICATION. I SEE NO HARM HOWEVER IN STATEMENT
THAT YOU AND I HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY IN COMMUNICATION OVER THIS MATTER
IF YOU CONSIDER IT DESIRABLE."
324This appeared under the title "With the South African De legation" by Pyarelal, who explained that the
delegation led by Sorabjee Rustomjee "sought Gandhiji’s advice on the starting of successful satyagraha. "
According to Pyarelal, the delegation saw Gandhiji more than once and the last time was in the sweeper s’
colony in Delhi( Harijan , May 19, 1946), where he had arrived on April 1, 1946, so that the interview took
place on or after that date.GANDHIJI: The difference between then and now is this: that in those days the blacklegs
became isolated after a time, and it was possible to hold monster meetings everywhere.
Parsee Rustomjee went among the indentured labourers and, in t he final struggle, they
rose like one man. Repeat that history today, and you will win. Do not repeat it, and you
will fail. Do you command the sympathy and support of all the interests? Will the
mercantile community back you?
SORABJEE: The mercantile co mmunity was not with us even then.
G: But we had Cachalia.325If you have one Cachalia amongst you, the whole of the
mercantile community will be covered.
S:Suppose no merchant comes forward. Is not a struggle possible then?
G: It will then take a dif ferent turn and in the end the mercantile community will be
swept out of existence.
A MEMBER: We are a difficult community at times.
ANOTHER MEMBER: And quarrelsome too.
G: I know, I know. The South Africa of today is not far different from the South Africa
that I have known. In the first article I wrote for the Indian Opinion I said that if after all
there was one true man in South Africa, he will cover all. He will build up the whole
structure from within. "Amidst a whole heap of bad coins," I wrote , "if there is one true
sovereign, the heap will be worth that one sovereign and no more." If you produce one
civil resister of merit, he will pull things through. Do not start the struggle, therefore,
unless you have that stuff. Manage to exist you will a nyhow. But that should not satisfy
you. You have to live as a self -respecting community with an equal status. Indians have
to make good that position by showing the real stuff.
The discussion then turned on the strategy of the proposed satyagraha . Gandhi ji was
definitely opposed to sitting in prohibited seats in trains and railway carriages by way of
satyagraha .Satyagraha should be on a clear, unequivocal and impersonal issue and
capable of taking thousands in its fold...
Gandhiji mentioned how he had refused to send a message for a meeting of the West
Africa Federation that was held some time back in London, because they conceived of a
struggle after the way of Europe. He added:
Probably theirs is not the way of non -violence. One day the black races will rise like the
avenging Attila against their white oppressors, unless someone presents to them the
weapon of satyagraha .
325A. M. CachaliaA MEMBER: You have said, we should associate with Zulus and Bantus. Does it not
mean joining them in a common anti -white front?
G: Yes, I have said that we should associate with Zulus, Bantus, etc. It means that you
take them under your wing when you have developed that power of non -violence. You
will be their saviour. But if you allow yourselves to be overwhelmed and swept off y our
feet, it will be their and your ruin. Their slogan today is no longer merely 'Asia for the
Asiatics` or 'Africa for the Africans` but the unity of all the exploited races of the earth.
On India rests the burden of pointing the way to all the exploited races. She won’t be able
to bear that burden today, if non -violence does not permeate us more than today. I have
been trying to fit ourselves for that mission by giving a wider bend to our struggle. India
will become a torch bearer to the oppressed and exp loited races, only if she can vindicate
the principle of non -violence in her own case, not jettison it as soon as independence of
foreign control is achieved.
ANOTHER MEMBER: Race consciousness is arising all over South Africa. We Indians
take advantage of the Bantus. We send our children to Native colleges. But we are
ashamed to call ourselves Natives. They feel we are arrogant and aloof. We do not do
enough to make an adequate return for what we have got from them. They are getting
resentful and the whi te man encourages and promotes that feeling to widen the gulf.
G: It will be an evil day for you, if he succeeds. The trouble is that you are all
worshippers of the golden calf.
CHRISTOPHER: Having never seen it, how can we worship it?
G: Worshipping is different from seeing. Don’t we worship God without seeing Him?
The delegation then asked if a leader could be sent from India to organise and lead them.
Gandhiji, in reply, told them that a leader would have to arise from among them. He
hoped that they would throw up one in due time. He described to them how he had been
arguing with his son Manilal to train up his children for the task. After they had finished
their education in India, he hoped, they would go back and settle down in South Africa
and serve the Indian community. Apropos the training that would equip South Africa -
born Indian children for service, he mentioned how he had refused to send his own
children to Lovedale and Fort Hare.326
Harijan , May 19, 1946; Collected Works , Volume 83, pag es 352 -354
326Lovedale is a secondary school and Fort Hare a college, both established by Christian missions for the
education of Africans.206. MESSAGE TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN COMMUNITY, MAY 1946327
It is my firm conviction that Indians in South Africa must not submit to the latest racial
legislation of the Union of South Africa. They have well nigh exhausted all constitutio nal
means of seeking redress. Therefore, they have at their disposal the matchless weapon of
satyagraha which was successfully tried for the first time in South Africa. There is no
cause therefore for despair. They must vindicate the honour of the nation t o which they
belong by use of satyagraha , whether they are few or many. They must not selfishly
submit to the contemplated segregation nor accept the racial franchise.
Messages to South African Indian Community from the Leaders of India , Durban, June 1,
1946
207. INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA
The Indian deputation from South Africa have made a great stir in India. They propose to
approach the U.N.O.328with a view to enlisting the latter’s sympathy. But the legislation
is going through. The Indian High Commi ssioner will be withdrawn as he should be.
What little aid he can render is nothing compared to the indignity of representing a
country whose inhabitants are to be treated as an inferior race. This new caste is worse
than the ancient but dying institution of India which has some redeeming features, even
while it is dying. But the new civilised edition has none. It shamelessly proclaims that
white civilisation requires the erection of legal barriers in order to protect itself against
Asiatics and Africans. T he Indians in South Africa are bearing a heavy burden which
they are well able to discharge. Satyagraha , the mightiest weapon in the world, was born
and bred there. If they make effective use of it, it will be well with the sacred cause they
are handling. It is not one of making it easy for a handful to be permitted to live and trade
there if they wear the badge of inferiority called years ago by an Englishman in South
Africa "dog’s collar." The cause is the cause of the honour of India and through her of a ll
the exploited Coloured races of the earth, whether they are brown, yellow or black. It is
worth all the suffering of which they are capable.

Dear Mr. Abell,329
327This message was given to Sorabjee Rustomjee. Please see previous item.
328United Nations Organisation
329Private Secretary to the ViceroyHis Excellency330I have no doubt has seen from the papers that the passive resistance
movement on the part of the Indians there has commenced against the Anti -Asiatic Act
recently passed by the South African Union Legislature. Is it too much to expect His
Excellency to support and express his approval of the movement, as did Lord Hardinge
on a similar occasion in South Africa during his Viceroyalty?331
Yours sincerely,
M.K. Gandhi332

330The Viceroy, Field Marshal Lord Wavell (1883 -1950), Viceroy of India, 1943 -47
331The reference is to the statement by the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge, on November 24, 1913. Please see
footnote to item 4 above.
332Mr. Abell replied on June 18, 1946, as follows:
"The Government of India have already given notice of the termination of the Trade Agreement with
South Africa, and have called back their High Commissioner for consultation; they have also decided
to refer the dispute to U.N.O. H.E. agreed with all these decisions.
"H.E. has every sympathy for the Indian case and has done a ll he can to support and further it, but he
thinks it would be a mistake for him to make any public declaration on the subject, and that it might do
more harm than good to the cause of Indians in South Africa."
33315. Pyarelal in Harijan (June 30, 1946) p refaced his report of this speech with the following:
"The heroic struggle going on in South Africa has become a theme of his after -prayer talks. ‘We hold it
to be a crime against man and God to submit meekly any longer to a policy of segregation that is
causing disaster to our country and our people,’ runs the Passive Resistance resolution passed at a
meeting of the Transvaal Indian Congress held at Johannesburg on April 21, 1946. ‘They must
remember,’ continues the resolution, ‘that non -violence is the basis of this movement and that this
struggle is directed against the policy of segregation and not against the white population of this
country.’
"The struggle has the full sympathy of the European democrats and the African section of South Africa.
Said the President of the African National Congress at the Transvaal Indian Congress mass meeting:
‘I declare from this platform that we Africans do not only sympathise, but will support and assist
in all possible manner the Indians in their struggle against this inhuman legislation.’
“Yesterday,” he continued, “it was the turn of Africans, today it is the turn of the Indians, tomorrow it
will be the turn of the Coloured and there is no knowing where this policy of racialism will end.’"(Referring to the start of the passive resistance struggle of the Indian community in South
Africa, Gandhiji described how some white people there had taken the law into their own
hands and were harassing the passive resisters who were fighting for their self -respect
and the honour of India.)334
The Union Government seems to be just watching while the whites commit mischief. It is
wrong. It is bad enough to pass an unjust law, but it is worse to let white people take the
law into their own hands. They ought to realise that Indians are in no way inferior to them.
The latter cannot submit to segregation. The only way open to the m to obtain redress is
through satyagraha . They are offering it against the offending law by setting up tents in
the prohibited areas. Some white men have vowed vengeance against them. They have
been daily raiding their tents, and terrorising them. Some wo men are also among the
resisters. But they have bravely told the men that they will stand by them and share their
vicissitudes. It is no small thing in South Africa. The movement is being led, according to
the papers, by Dr. Dadoo and Dr. Naicker.335It was the duty of the Government to stop
this hooliganism of the whites. They can take action against the passive resisters
according to law. What is taking place there today is worse than martial law.336
I do not say these things to incite you to anger against the whites of South Africa. If you
do that you will be unworthy to take part in the prayers. I want you to go home and pray
that God may give strength to our brethren and sisters in South Africa, who are fighting
for the honour of India, to face all hardsh ips bravely; secondly that He may show light to
the whites so that they may cease to inflict inhuman atrocities and the eyes of the
Government there may be opened so that they may treat Indians as fellow human beings.
The whites of South Africa too are our brethren, being children of the same God.
When we have the control of India’s affairs in our own hands such things will become
impossible. A free India wedded to truth and non -violence will teach the lesson of peace
334The Indian commu nity began passive resistance on the night of June 13, 1946. Volunteers pitched tents
in a vacant municipal land on the corner of Gale Street and Umbilo Road in Durban to court arrest. Initially,
the police took no action. On 19 June, bands of white hoolig ans jeered at, threatened and attacked the
passive resisters.
335Dr. Yusuf M. Dadoo and Dr. G. M. Naicker, Presidents of the Transvaal and Natal Passive Resistance
Councils
336Harijan (June 30, 1946) has the following:
"The passive resisters are not cr iminals but respectable citizens. As self -respecting people they
will prefer imprisonment to segregation in ghettos. They will resist injustice and oppression with
their last breath. It is open to the South African Government to visit them with the penalty of the
law for breach or to abrogate the Segregation Act which is contrary to the dictates of humanity.
But it will be a dark blot on the history of the white civilisation if lynch law is allowed to have its
course in South Africa." He hoped that the Sout h African Government and the civilised conscience
of mankind would not allow that.to the inhabitants of South Africa. B ut it is for you and the Congress to decide whether a
free India will follow the path of peace or the sword...

210. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI, JUNE 22, 1 946
...He was glad to tell them, Gandhiji continued, that according to the latest reports
received from South Africa, the police there had surrounded the camping ground of the
satyagrahis , and had given notice to the white population that baiting of the p assive
resisters would not be allowed.337The passive resisters were not criminals but respectable
citizens. They were fighting for the vindication of their rights. As self -respecting people
they preferred imprisonment to segregation in ghettos. They would r esist injustice and
oppression with their last breath.
It was open to the South African Government to visit them with the penalty of law or to
abrogate the Segregation Act338that was contrary to the dictates of humanity. But it
would be a dark blot on the history of the white civilisation if lynch law was allowed to
have its course in South Africa. He hoped that the South African Government and the
civilised conscience of mankind would not allow that. The whites outside South Africa
should not allow themse lves to be carried away by any misleading propaganda, but
should exercise a restraining influence on the South African whites...

211. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI , JUNE 23, 1946
...He was also happy to inform them that 16 passive resisters in South Africa had been
arrested by the South African Government.339
Asatyagrahi breaks laws repugnant to his self -respect and invites the penalty, which he
faces cheerfully. Prison -going is not a matter of sorrow to him but of joy. A satyagrahi
does not expect preferential treatment in prison, but he does expect humane treatment. At
the same time he must be prepared to face the worst. He hoped that the passive resisters
in So uth Africa would prove themselves to be ideal satyagrahis in every respect...
337On June 21, white hooligans again attacked the passive resisters despite appeals for calm by the Mayor
of Durban and the Attorney -General of Natal.

cautioned or given suspended sentences.Bombay Chronicle , June 24, 1946; Collected Works , Volume 84, page 360
212. WHITE MAN’S BURDEN340
According to Reuter, picked Indians, men and women, headed by Dr. Naicker,
commenced satyagraha (in South Africa popularly known as passive resistance) on June
14th in respect of the Segregation Law of the Union Parliament of South Africa. The
same agency further reports that neither the Government nor the Municipality had taken
any action against the passive resisters but that some "whites" of Durban had taken the
execution of the law into their own hands by raiding the camp at night, cutting down tents
swiftly and carrying them away. "A band of 100 young white men broke through t he
cordon of 50 Indian passive resisters, pulled down the tents and dragged them away torn.
Some camp stretchers were smashed and blankets and pillows removed. Two women
resisters were involved in the melee. They are stated to have been kicked but not
injured."341
The papers report that after three days of hooliganism the Borough police had posted
themselves near the scene of passive resistance and warned the hooligans against
molesting the resisters and terrorising them into submission.342This is heartening news.
Let us hope that it can be taken at its full value and that the protection means fullest
protection against lawlessness, sporadic or organised. Organised popular lawlessness is
known as lynching, so shamelessly frequent in America.
Before the Segr egation Law was passed, white men, known to be respectable, had carried
anti-Asiatic agitation to the point of frenzy. Not satisfied with their triumph in having
legislation compelling segregation passed probably beyond expectation, the more
advanced secti on among the agitators have become the executioners of their own laws.
They do not know that they are thereby defaming the white man’s name!!!
My appeal to the white men and women who have regard for laws for which they have
voted is that they should cre ate public opinion against hooliganism and lynch law.
340Gandhiji sent an advance copy of this article to the Viceroy. Gandhiji’s Correspondence with the
Government, 1944 -47, page 162.
341In fact, the white hooligans brutally attacked the passive resisters on June 23rd, using lethal weapons.
Five resisters fell unconscious and were thrown by the mob in the gutter. Many re sisters were injured,
including women. Miss Zainab Asvat received a cut on the side of her head and Mrs. Docrat received
internal injuries.
The Reuter report was apparently not accurate.
342On June 24, the Government issued a proclamation prohibiting an y gathering within 400 yards of the
passive resistance site. Passive resisters were then arrested.Passive resistance is aimed at removal in a most approved manner of bad laws, customs
or other evils and is designed to be a complete and effective substitute for forcible
methods including hooliganis m and lynch law. It is an appeal to the heart of man. Often
reason fails. It is dwarfed by self. The theory is that an adequate appeal to the heart never
fails. Seeming failure is not of the law of satyagraha but of incompetence of the
satyagrahi by whatev er cause induced. It may not be possible to give a complete
historical instance. The name of Jesus at once comes to the lips. It is an instance of
brilliant failure. And he has been acclaimed in the West as Prince of passive resisters. I
showed years ago i n South Africa that the adjective "passive" was a misnomer, at least as
applied to Jesus. He was the most active resister known perhaps to history. His was non -
violence par excellence . But I must no longer stray from my main subject. It is the
resistance o f the Jesus type that the white hooligans are seeking to thwart. Let us hope
that our countrymen’s heroic resistance will not only shame the hooligans into silence but
prove the precursor of the repeal of the law that disfigures the statute book of South
Africa. In concrete form, what pure suffering, wholly one -sided, does is to stir public
opinion against a wrong. Legislators are, after all, representatives of the public. In
obedience to it they have enacted a wrong. They have to reverse the process when t he
same public, awakened to the wrong, demands its removal.
The real "white man’s burden" is not insolently to dominate Coloured or Black people
under the guise of protection, it is to desist from the hypocrisy which is eating into them.
It is time white men learnt to treat every human being as their equal. There is no mystery
about whiteness of the skin. It has repeatedly been proved that given equal opportunity a
man, be he of any colour or country, is fully equal to any other.
Therefore, white men th rough the world and especially of India should act upon their
fellow men in South Africa and call upon them not to molest Indian resisters who are
bravely struggling to preserve the self -respect of Indians in the Union and the honour of
their motherland. " Do unto others as you would that they should do unto you." Or, do
they take in vain the name of Him who said this? Have they banished from their hearts
the great Coloured Asiatic who gave to the world the above message? Do they forget that
the greatest of the teachers of mankind were all Asiatics and did not possess a white face?
These, if they descended on earth and went to South Africa, would all have to live in the
segregated areas and be classed as Asiatics and Coloured people unfit by law to be equals
of whites.
Is a civilisation worth the name which requires for its existence the very doubtful prop of
racial legislation and lynch law? The silver lining to the cloud that hangs over the
devoted heads of our countrymen lies in the plucky action of Rev. Scott,343a white
343The Reverend Michael Scott joined the resisters when white hooligans resorted to violence against them.
He was arrested on June 22 and was sentenced to a month in prison. B. Sischy, a white student, was
arrested with him.
Several Europeans, as well as Africans and Coloured people, joined the passive resistance in solidarity with
the Indians.clergyman, and his equally white fellow -workers, who have undertaken to share the
sufferings of the Indian resisters.

213. SPEECH AT PRAYER ME ETING, NEW DELHI, JUNE 27, 1946
The South African satyagraha was again the theme of Gandhiji’s talk after the prayers
today. The whites there were becoming more and more frenzied in their hooliganism and
seemed to be determined to cow down the satyagrahi swho were behaving in a calm and
dignified manner. The Indians in South Africa were a little over two lakhs344only. They
were a mere handful in the midst of the overwhelming majority of white men and
Africans.
Imagine what it must mean for men like Docto rs Naicker and Dadoo to be required to
live in special locations. I want you all to continue your prayers to God to enable our
brethren to remain steadfast till the end and to vouchsafe wisdom to the whites. Let me
repeat that prayer from the heart can ach ieve what nothing else can in the world...

214. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI, JUNE 28, 1946
Gandhiji paid tribute to the courage and suffering of the passive resisters without
retaliation in the midst of the hooliganism which was daily increasing. He was born in
India but was made in South Africa of which he knew practically every province. He had
passed there twenty years of his life at its meridia n. He knew the white men of South
Africa. He loved them as well as his countrymen. He felt ashamed, he said, of the
hooliganism of some of them. He had the fear that this hooliganism had the sympathy of
the mass of the white men of the Union. Hooliganism w ould not flourish without such
silent sympathy. He fondly hoped that as the white men realised the deep strength and
sincerity of satyagrahis , they would begin to respect them and transfer their sympathy to
the suffering passive resisters. He asked the gat hering to offer their heartfelt prayers for
God’s mercy on the hooligans.
He did not want them to send money to their countrymen. Money could not give them
victory. They had money enough. But a time might come when it would be their duty in
India to offe r non -violent resistance of the purest type for the sake of their brethren. He
could not tell how.
344Alakh is one hundred thousandIndia was fast becoming the storehouse of the honour and dignity of the human race. It
would be in the fitness of things if it fell to their lot to help th e struggle of the gallant
resisters of South Africa. But for that the way must be clear before them. He felt that he
would know when it was clear. Meantime he invoked the sympathy of the Viceroy and
the white men and women of India to do their portion of d uty...

215. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, POONA, JULY 1, 1946345
Gandhiji said that it grieved him to tell them that the hooliganism of the white men of
South Africa was daily growing worse. The relieving feature, however, was that the
courage and renunciation of the satyagrahis was rising to the occasion. One of the sisters,
Dr. Goonam, had been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment with hard labour.346The
tryin g Magistrate had reduced the term to four months. Dr. Goonam had objected to it
saying that she wanted no favour on the score of her sex. Her offence, if it could be so
called, was exactly the same as that of the men satyagrahis . But the Magistrate would n ot
listen to her objection.
Satyagrahis were being recruited in large numbers. He hoped and prayed, said Gandhiji,
that the satyagrahis would continue to be strong and firm and that their struggle would be
crowned with success...
The Hindu , July 3, 194 6;Collected Works , Volume 84, page 398
216. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, POONA, JULY 3, 1946
...Gandhiji said that he would not say that the situation in South Africa was deteriorating.
But it was certainly becoming graver. The Government repression was becoming worse.
That was, however, part of the bargain. A satyagrahi breaks the law and welcomes the
penalty.
345As it was Gandhiji’s day of silence, his written speech was read out after the prayers.
346Dr. K. Goonam Naidoo, the first Indian woman doctor in South Africa, was a leader of the community
and Vice -President of the Natal Indian Congress. She led the second batch of passive resi sters on June 22,
1946.
Dr. Goonam was sentenced on June 29, 1946, to six months with hard labour, in addition to the sentence of
7 days she had received for contravention of the Riotous Assemblies Act, but four months of the sentence
was suspended.Referring to the arrest and conviction of Parsee Sorabjee347to three months’ rigorous
imprisonment, he described how as a young lad of sixteen he had given proof of unusual
courage in the course of the satyagraha movement which he conducted in South Africa.
A mounted policeman threatened to overrun the passive resisters. Sorabjee held the reins
of the horse and told the policeman that he could not frighten the satyagrahis into
submission by such tactics.348
He was a worthy son of a worthy father, the late Parsee Rustomjee, both for his bravery
and munificence.
Gandhiji paid a glowing tribute to Rev. Scott of Johannesburg whose Christian
conscience had revolted against the inequality of the segregation law and the ill -treatment
to which passive resisters were being subjected. As a protest against it, Rev. Scott had
decided to cast in his lot with the satyagrahis and share with them the indignities to
which they were being subjected. It was no small thing for a white man to identify
himself with Coloured people in South Africa. If the satyagrahis remained free and non -
violent till the end, all would be well with them. He had already told the audience t heir
duty in this connection, that is, a heartfelt prayer to God to give strength to the
satyagrahis and light to the whites.

217. SPEECH AT MEETING OF THE ALL INDIA CONGRESS
COMMITTEE , BOMBAY, JULY 7, 1946
Gandhiji referred to the draft resolution on the satyagraha movement now being carried
on by Indians in South Africa.349He said that the Indians in South Africa were being ill -
treated not because they were not whites but because the y were considered as coolies.
347Sorabjee Rustomjee led the 17th batch of passive resisters on June 30, 1946, and was sentenced on July
2nd to three months’ imprisonment with hard labour.
348Please see footnote to item 76.
349The resolution read:
"The meeting of the A.I.C.C., while it is grieved that it has become imperative for the Indian settlers in
South Africa once more to offer satyagraha in the land of its birth, against a law imposing on them a
colour bar far more sinister than the one against which they had put up a brave fight between 1907 and
1914, congratulates the handful of satyagrahis on their brave but unequal action against heavy odds.
"The meeting is pleased to find that doctors and such other men and women are at the head of the
gallant struggle and that among them a re represented Parsis, Christians, Muslims and Hindus. This
meeting is also pleased to find that a few whitemen like the Rev. Scott have thrown in their lot with the
satyagrahis .
"The meeting condemns the action of some whitemen in resorting to the barba rous method known as
lynch law to terrorise the satyagrahis into submission to the humiliating legislation..."The Indians in South Africa spoke English and many of them were doctors and lawyers.
In spite of all this, the South African whites looked upon them as coolies and called them
as such. The Indians, of course, were in a minorit y and yet they were putting up a brave
fight. They had no swords or guns but they were determined to resist the anti -Indian laws
by soul force, which was the only force available to satyagrahis . Durban owed its present
prosperity to the Indians. The South African whites had agreed to give the Indians the
vote though not as equals but as inferiors.
The white civilisation in South Africa could not be kept alive by such means. Gandhiji
wondered how a brave man like General Smuts who had praised the Indians s o much in
the past could be instrumental in taking steps to deprive the Indians of their elementary
rights.
Commenting on the doings of the white hooligans who were said to have beaten to death
an Indian, whom they mistook for a satyagrahi ,350Gandhiji rem arked:
It is a sad event. Nevertheless, I feel happy. A satyagrahi must always be ready to die
with a smile on his face without retaliation and without rancour in his heart. Some people
have come to have a wrong notion that satyagraha means only jail -going, perhaps facing
lathi blows and nothing more. Such satyagraha cannot bring independence. To win
independence you have to learn the art of dying without killing.
I venture to submit that a civilisation which needs such barbarous legislation for its
protection is a contradiction in terms. The Indians are fighting for their honour. The land
in South Africa does not belong to the whites. Land belongs to one who labours on it. I
would not shed a single tear if all the satyagrahis in South Africa are wiped o ut. Thereby
they will not only bring deliverance to themselves but point the way to the Negroes and
vindicate the honour of India. I am proud of them and so should you be.
His object in speaking to them, he continued, was not to move them to tears or to incite
them to anger and vituperation against the whites. Rather they should pray to God to
guide the whites aright and grant strength and courage to their brethren to remain
steadfast to the end.
The South African struggle may appear to be insignificant today but it is charged with
momentous consequences. Satyagraha is today being tried in the land of its birth. The
success of a handful of Indians, mostly descendants of indentured labourers, has excited
the jealousy of the whites of South Africa. And the y are now subjecting them to
unspeakable indignities. They are sought to be segregated into ghettos and further
humiliated by being offered an inferior franchise. That all this should happen under the
imprimatur of Field Marshal Smuts fills me with shame a nd humiliation.
350On June 21, white hooligans attacked Krishnansamy Pillai, a plainclothes policeman on duty in the
vicinity of the passive resistance camp, an d beat him unconscious. He died of the wounds on June 30th.
The Indian community organised his funeral which was attended by ten thousand people.Our sins have a strange way of coming home to roost. We turned a portion of ourselves
into pariahs and today the whites of South Africa are doing the same to our compatriots
there. Let us purge ourselves of this curse and bless the heroic struggle of our brethren in
South Africa. They do not need our monetary help. But they need all our sympathy and
moral support.

218. SPEECH AT PRAYE R MEETING, POONA, JULY 10, 1946
I know what is taking place there (in South Africa) because in a way I belong to South
Africa, having passed twenty years of the best part of my life there. It was there that
satyagraha was born.
The West is passing thro ugh a purgatory today. The vanquished lie prostrate at the feet of
the victors. But those who have won the war have found that they are no more victors
than those who have lost it. Yet it is not in World War II that the Western civilisation will
have met i ts grave. It is being dug in South Africa. The white civilisation in South Africa
looks black in contrast with the Coloured or the Asiatic civilisation which is
comparatively white. If our people remain steadfast and non -violent till the end, I have
not a shadow of doubt that their heroic struggle will drive the last nail into the coffin of
Western civilisation which is being found in its true colours in South Africa.
The whites in South Africa are becoming like brutes. Eastern and Western cultures are
pitted against each other. And what a contrast they present! The whites have enacted
savage laws to force the Indians to live in ghettos. Field Marshal Smuts is a great
philosopher. He calls me his friend. He has nothing to say against Asiatic culture. But h e
has to take measures to safeguard the white civilisation. He told me that he did not look
down upon Coloured people. The fact that Mrs. Subbaroyan,351when she went to
England for studies, stayed in Field Marshal Smuts’ house supports the statement. But,
said the Field Marshal, in spite of the absence of prejudice, he was bound to protect
Western culture in South Africa and he hoped that an understanding man that I was, I
would appreciate it.
Gandhiji failed to understand how a culture or civilisation wor th the name could require
legal protection. The Indians were resisting the ghetto law in a civil, i.e., non -violent and
therefore civilised way. They welcomed the penalty for the breach of law which could
not be morally defended. But the white hooligans to o were breaking their own laws.
Theirs was criminal disobedience. It was a matter of pride for India that the children of
indentured labourers and traders -many of them descendants of Harijans -were proving
351Mrs. Radhabai Subbaroyan, wife of Dr. P. Subbaroyan, zamindar of Kumaramangalam, studied at
Oxford Univers ity and was prominent in public affairs.themselves such brave satyagrahis . As against t his the whites were resorting to lynch law.
He remarked:
After all civil resistance had its birth in Asia. Jesus was an Asiatic. If he was reborn and
went to South Africa today and lived there, he would have to live in a ghetto.
He hoped that as in 191 4, Field Marshal Smuts would at long last realise that he could not
persecute the Indians in South Africa for ever and come to an honourable settlement with
them when he had tried them through and through. A committee of white men had been
formed in South Africa to express sympathy with and identify themselves with the cause
of the Indian passive resisters there.352
There was something of that kind in his time also. But this time it seemed to be on a
bigger scale. If this becomes extensive and the hooliganis m is stopped and anti -Asiatic
laws are repealed, there is hope of a blending of Eastern and Western cultures. Otherwise
South Africa may prove to be the grave of Western civilisation.

219. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, POONA, JULY 11, 1946
Giving the latest news from South Africa to the prayer gathering, Gandhiji said that men

news. Victory was sure if they kep t up that spirit.

220. INTERVIEW TO LOUIS FISCHER, JULY 17, 1946
...FISCHER: The growing anti -white feeling here is bad. In the Taj Mahal Hotel353they
have put up a notice "South Africans n ot admitted." I do not like it. Your non -violence
should make you more generous.
GANDHIJI: That won’t be non -violence. Today the white man rules in India. So, if the
Taj Mahal has the gumption to put up that notice, it is a feather in its cap.
F:That is what any nationalist will say. You must say something better.
352A "Council for Asiatic Rights" was formed in Johannesburg and a "Council of Human Rights" was set
up in Durban to mobilise sympathy and support to passive resistance campaign.
353In BombayG: Then I will be a nationalist for once. They have no right to be here if they do not deal
with Indians on terms of equality.
F:No right -yes. But you must give them more than their ri ght. You must invite them.
G: Yes. When I am the Viceroy.
F:You mean the President of the Indian Republic.
G: No. I will be quite content to be the Viceroy, a constitutional Viceroy, for the time
being. The first thing I will do will be to vacate th e Viceregal Lodge and give it to the
Harijan s. I will then invite the South African white visitors to my hut and say to them:
"You have ground my people to powder. But we won’t copy you. We will give you more
than you desire. We won’t lynch you as you do i n South Africa" -and thus shame them
into doing the right.
F:There is so much anti -white feeling today.
G: Of course, I am opposed to that. It can do no good to anybody.
F:The world is so divided. And there might be another war and that may be bet ween the
Coloured and the white races.
G: Europe seems to be heading for another war. It is not sufficiently exhausted.
F:Europe is terribly exhausted. But with the atom bomb human beings don’t matter so
much. A few scientists are enough. The next war will be carried on by pressing a few
buttons. That is why colour war is so dangerous.
G: Anything is better than cowardice. It is violence double distilled.
And to illustrate his remark Gandhiji narrated the story of a Negro clergyman with a
Herculean frame in South Africa saying "pardon me brother," when insulted by a white
man, and sneaking into a Coloured man’s compartment.
This is not non -violence. It is a travesty of Jesus’ teaching. It would have been more
manly to retaliate...

221. LETTER TO S. B. MEDH, JULY 26, 1946
Chi. Medh,I got your long letter of 3 July 1946 on the 25th. The wire has not come. You have given
a lot of news in your letter. In the context of a movement of such magnitude it is futile if
not difficult to guess who are noble and who are not. Water from many sources flows into
the Ganga and yet the Ganga is pure as ever. A major movement is like the stream of the
Ganga and is always pure. Under the circumst ances our dharma is to stay as pure as the
Gangotri. Then all will be well. If she did not remain pure for all time the Ganga would
cease to be what she is and turn into a filthy river. We see such things happening in our
midst.
Manilal will tell you the rest. The papers here carry a Reuter’s cable saying that he has
reached there.354I am certainly very glad that he went there. Without doubt that was his
dharma.
I had told Sorab355that no (financial) help whatever should be sent from here. That is my
advice now. I am arranging for a lot of other help and you will continue to receive it. It
should be a rule with all struggles to depend solely on local support. You will remember
that for my part I had tried to avoid help coming from India. But it did come. S ome came
from England, too, which I put to good use. One might say that in those times it was even
necessary to some extent. My experience, however, is that whenever aid arrived from
outside we grew lax. Now I see no need to send even a cowrie from here.

223. NEWS FROM SOUTH AFRICA
354Manilal Gandhi ha d rushed back to South Africa from India because of the launching of the passive
resistance movement.
Gandhiji had written to him on June 25, 1946:
"I approve of your returning soon. What seems to be happening is excellent. You should participate in
itwhole -heartedly." ( Collected Works , Volume 84, page 369).
355Sorabjee RustomjeeThe following news from South Africa will be of interest to the readers.
Rev. Michael Scott who has thrown in his lot with Indians in their struggle there, has
written a not e under the caption "Not by Might." It is already published in the dailies. It
should make a special appeal to all Europeans. He adds in a personal note:
"The spirit which enshrined you and your movement here will not be extinguished by
the powerful and cunning forces which are now arrayed against it."
An English sister writes from Durban:
"I went along to the camp almost the first day just to give the campers a word of
encouragement and was quite impressed by their cheerfulness and general attitude -it
was the real thing like some of the Indian movements I have seen. Then I went to the
court one day too and it seemed as though those on trial (apparently) were really the
judges and the officials and the Government were in the dock. If you have seen th e
statements by some of the leaders, you will see they give the same impression.
"Rev. Michael Scott is a very good man. He is only about 40 years old and wears
shirts as do many high Anglicans and is addressed as Father Scott. He reminds me
somewhat of C.F. Andrews.
"I am glad to know that Manilal is coming back. He will be a help to the leaders here,
though, as a matter of fact, the struggle on the Indian side has been on a very high
level up to the present. It is that that has drawn a group of Europe ans to support the
struggle but the number is not very large yet."
As I have said before, the battle will certainly go to our countrymen if they remain truly
non-violent. Non -violence knows no defeat.
Another friend writes:
"You have heard of Mrs. N aidoo’s356passing. She met with an accident about three
months before her death. During all that time the family could not get my phone
number due to some error on the part of the exchange. Mrs. Naidoo wanted to see me
but they could not contact me till the day after her death. I loved her. She was a sweet
soul, a real friend and had a genius for home -making. There was always a beautiful
atmosphere in the Naidoo home and one could drop in at any time, no matter how
busy she was and always feel a welcome gues t. And what a heroine she was! Think of
356Mrs. G. K. Thambi Naidoo. Wife of a leading satyagrahi , she herself went to prison in 1913 in the final
phase of satyagraha .the anxiety she must have gone through all the time the children were in India.357I do
hope that there will be a joint memorial to her and Thambi."
Incidentally I must mention that Mrs. Naidoo’s husband was one of t he first satyagrahis
during the days of our struggle there in my time.

224. STRUGGLE OF INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA
The heroic struggle of the Indian settlers in So uth Africa continues with unabated zeal. It
promises to be prolonged. The longer the resisters are made to suffer, the greater will be
their glory and reward. It is true of all long suffering. What the Government of the Union
of South Africa has done so de liberately is not going to be changed suddenly, even for
the sufferings of the brave men and women. This is said not to damp the zeal of the
fighters but to steel them for greater and longer suffering. Their spokesmen, when they
were in India, were told in plain language that they must not expect the struggle to close
quickly.358Time runs always in favour of the sufferer, for the simple reason that tyranny
becomes more and more exposed as it is continued. In reality it is never long. Sufferers
need never los e hope whether their struggle appears to have a longer lease of life or
shorter, when the result is a certainty.

225. TWO LETTERS FROM SIR SHAFA’AT AHMED KHAN
Sir Shafa’at Ahmed Khan359who, but for the recent murderous assault on him, would
have joined the Interim Government yesterday, wrote on August 6th to me an interesting
letter from which I quote as follows:
357Mr. and Mrs. Thambi Naidoo presented thei r four sons to Gandhiji, on the eve of his departure from
South Africa in 1914, for the service of India. One of the sons, Fakiri, died in India, and the others returned
to South Africa after more than 15 years.
358The reference is to the delegation of th e South African Indian Congress, led by Sorabjee Rustomjee.
Please see items 202 and 205.
359High Commissioner of India in South Africa, 1941 -45"My study of the Indian community while I was i n South Africa convinced me that
but for your heroic work in the Union, the Indian race in that country would not have
survived as a self -respecting community. You built up, cell by cell, the power of
resistance in a highly gifted race and your work in tha t country is the inspiration of
the Indian race in South Africa at the present time.
"My sole aim in South Africa was to lay the foundation of Indian unity in Natal. I do
not think I succeeded completely in my aim but I am inclined to think that the hero ic
struggle which our race is carrying on at the present time would have been impossible
but for the dissolution of the Natal Indian Association and A.I. Kajee's Natal Indian
Congress and the revival of the Natal Indian Congress which you had founded in
1894. This was accomplished on August 29th, 1943, and since that time, there has
been only one political organisation of Indians in Natal.
"The South African situation is complicated and owing to conventions of diplomacy,
my lips are sealed. My despatches from South Africa which give a complete picture
of the political situation for three years and are very exhaustive, cannot be published
owing to conventions of international intercourse...
"I came to the conclusion that no redress of our grievances in So uth Africa is possible
unless we are masters in our own homeland and India is free."
In reply to my letter acknowledging receipt of the above, Sir Shafa’at Ahmed Khan
further writes:
"You will be glad to hear that since my return from South Africa, I h ave been busy
preparing my speeches in South Africa and have added a section in my book, shortly
to be published, on the history of the Indian community in South Africa.360In this I
have made bold to give a brief account of your work there and followed with greatest
interest your march to Volksrust, etc.
"For more than three years -1942 -45-I wrote lengthy despatches to the Government
of India on the South African problem and in April 1943 I warned them against
General Smuts` policy and told them to take the strongest measures against the Union
Government in connection with the Pegging Act... Strong measures have been taken
now, but I am afraid it is too late. If the Congress forms a National Government soon
and the new member in charge of the Department decides to publish these despatches,
particularly from April 1943 onwards, they will clear up numerous points for the next
session of U.N.O. I am bound to say that the convention is that such despatches are
not published unless and until there is rupture o f relations between two countries. I
offer no opinion as to whether they should be published at all. This is a matter which
the new Government should decide."

226. TIRED OF SATYAGRAHA
News comes from Durban that a group of Indians has sprung up in South Africa who
have lost faith in satyagraha . They cherish the dream that they can overthrow the rule of
the White man there only by joining forces with t he Negroes, the Coloured people, other
Asiatics and European sympathisers and adopting violent means. The rumour, if there is
any truth in it, is disturbing and a definite fly in the ointment. All, whether they believe in
non-violence or not, should realis e that Indians in South Africa gained world -wide
esteem simply because, in spite of being a handful, they showed infinite capacity for
suffering and did not, through losing their patience, resort to sabotage and violence. They
learnt the wholesome lesson t hat true well -being springs from suffering and that victory
lies in unity. From my own experience, my firm advice to Indians in South Africa is that
they should, on no account, be lured away into throwing aside the matchless weapon of
satyagraha .
This do es not, however, imply that they are not to accept the help of the Coloured people,
Negroes and any other sympathisers or that they will not help them in their need, should
occasion arise. The only condition is that satyagraha should be their one and only
weapon. If they go astray from the path of non -violence, they will conform to the
description of the poor woman who as an Indian proverb goes, went in search of a son
and succeeded in losing her husband!

228. PLUCKY STAND
361Chairman of the Tran svaal Passive Resistance CouncilPapers received from Natal contain among other things a remarkable correspondence
between the Mayoral Secretary of Durban and the Natal Indian Congress Secretary. A
committee has been formed for making arrangements for the Royal visit to D urban
proposed to take place in the month of March next year. The main committee has
established a sub -committee to deal with the question of joining the Coloured and non -
European sections of the population of Durban. For the purpose, the Committee invited
the Natal Indian Congress to appoint two representatives to serve on the sub -committee
so as to give their advice and assistance to enable the Indian community to see Their
Majesties and the Royal Princesses.
To this invitation the Joint Hon. Secretary of the Natal Indian Congress (Meer Saheb)362
sent the following plucky reply on the 11th September last:
"I am directed by my Executive to state that while the Indian community has the
greatest respect for Their Majesties and the Royal Princesses, it must be noted that the
Indians of South Africa are at the present moment passing through the most critical
period in their history. A series of colour discriminatory Acts depriving us of our
elementary human rights during the last half century has culminated i n the passing of
the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, 1946, passed in the teeth of
the strongest opposition ever voiced by our community. The action of the Union
Government in thus oppressing a voteless section of its population has plung ed the
whole Indian community in a state of grave unrest. Recent trends in colour legislation
leave no room for doubt as to what is in store for people of colour in this country. The
colour of a man’s skin has become the sole criterion of judging human qua lities.
"As a result of all this the Indian community of South Africa resolved on the 13th
June, 1946 to launch a campaign of passive resistance against colour discrimination
in the laws of this country. This peaceful protest still goes on and 627 of our people,
including national leaders like Dr. Yusuf Dadoo and Dr. G.M. Naicker, have been
sent to jail where they are treated like common criminals. Some of them have served
their sentence and have been released after being subjected to inhuman treatment bu t
hundreds still remain behind prison bars and many more continue to be sent to prison
daily.
"While the Indian community finds itself in such an unhappy situation in a part of His
Majesty’s Empire, it is most unreasonable to expect Indians to participat e in any
rejoicing or celebrations in honour of Royalty. In the circumstances we cannot but
suggest that you advise Their Majesties to postpone their visit until such time as there
is peace and goodwill in South Africa between the rulers and the ruled, the White and
the non -White, the represented and the unrepresented, the privileged and the under -
privileged, so that all who constitute the South African nation can equally share, not
only its burdens, but also its rewards."
362A. I. Meer, secretary of the Natal Indian CongressThe Natal Indian Congress Execut ive is to be congratulated on the reply. The Royal visit
can evoke no feeling of joy among those who are fighting for their self -respect in South
Africa in the making of which they have had no mean share. Let us hope that the Royal
visit will be postponed to a more propitious time when the colour bar has become a thing
of the past. Such self -denial on the part of Their Majesties will be quite in keeping with
the direction which the King and Queen recently issued to substitute in the National
Anthem the foll owing new verses:
Nor on this land alone,
But be God’s mercies known,
From shore to shore.
Lord make the nations see,
That men should brothers be,
And form one family,
The wide world o’er.
for the antiquated and indefensible verses:
Oh, Lord ou r God arise,
Scatter his enemies,
and make them fall.
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks.
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all.

229. WHAT WILL SOUTH AFRICA DO?
The deputation headed by Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit and sent to the U.N.O.
Conference by the Interim Government has undoubtedly done very effective work with
marked ability and success.363That is clear from the fol lowing cablegram sent by
Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit from New York:
363Mrs. Vijayalakshmi Pandit was leader of the delegation of India to the second part of the First Session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations, held in New Y ork in 1946.
On November 30, 1946, the Joint Committee of the First and Sixth Committees of the General Assembly
adopted a French -Mexican proposal, supported by India and opposed by the Union of South Africa, by 24
votes to 19, with 6 abstentions. The pr oposal was subsequently adopted by the Assembly, at its Plenary
Meeting on December 8, 1946, by a two -thirds majority (32 votes to 15, with 7 abstentions), as resolution
44(I)."TODAY WITH YOUR BLESSINGS JUSTICE OF SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN
CAUSE WAS VINDICATED. COMMITTEE VOTING TWENTY -FOUR TO
NINETEEN IN OUR FAVOUR. WENT TO GENERAL SMUTS AFTER
MEETING AND SHOOK H ANDS. HE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION AT
MANNER IN WHICH I HAD CONDUCTED CASE."364
It remains now to be seen how the Parliament of the Union of South Africa and its
European public respond. Field Marshal Smuts was able to hurl at the Indian deputation
the taunt that India treated her so -called untouchables, legally described as the
"Scheduled Classes," much worse than the Union treated her Asiatics or for that matter
the Africans. There would be much to be said for the Field Marshal’s taunt if it was true.
It istrue of South Africa that her treatment of Asiatics has legally deteriorated from time
to time, so much so that it has now become well -nigh unbearable. Almost every promise
made by the Union Government to the Government of India has now been broken. In
India, on the other hand, there never has been any law carrying the bar sinister against the
Scheduled Classes. It can be proved upto the hilt that the law has always sought to protect
the Scheduled Classes. There is no legal bar, so far as I am aware, agains t any of the
Scheduled Classes being regarded as equal in status to the tallest Indian. What is however
true to the shame of orthodox Hinduism and the Sanatanji Hindus is that religious custom
has denied to these untouchables the rights which the law has a llowed, and it is
unfortunately also true that sometimes custom overrides the law. But public opinion is
progressively rising against this barbarous custom and it is merely a question of time
when the custom will be swept out of existence. Let us, therefor e, hope that instead of
Under the resolution, the General Assembly expressed the opinion that "the tr eatment of Indians in the
Union of South Africa should be in conformity with the international obligations under the agreements
concluded between the two Governments and the relevant provisions of the (United Nations) Charter"; and
requested the two Govern ments "to report at the next session of the General Assembly the measures
adopted to this effect."
364According to a report in Bombay Chronicle (November 30, 1946), Mrs. Vijayalakshmi Pandit, in her
reply to Heaton Nichols of South Africa before the Assem bly Committee on the previous day, had said:
"When I was coming here I saw Mahatma Gandhi, who is very much interested in this whole case. He said
to me as I was leaving: ‘I do not mind whether you come back having won your case or having suffered
defeat, but you must come back as a friend of General Smuts.’ And that is not what any man in Mahatma
Gandhi’s position would have said."
She wrote in her memoirs that Gandhiji had told her:
"Remember, I want the delegation of my country to set an example. I s hall be happy if we get votes,
but I shall be most unhappy if these are gained in any manner that is divorced from our guidelines... I
would not like to lose his (Smuts’s) friendship and respect for the sake of gaining a majority vote."
(The Scope of Happi ness: A Personal Memoir , p. 206).
After the vote in the Assembly, she went up to General Smuts and said: "I have come to you to say that if,
in the course of this unhappy debate, I have said anything which was not up to the high standard Gandhiji
had imp osed on me, I ask your pardon." He took her hand in both of his and said: "My child, you have won
a hollow victory. This vote will put me out of power in our next elections, but you will have gained
nothing." (Ibid. p. 211).taking doubtful advantage of the things in India which no one defends and against which
public opinion is progressively rising, the Europeans of the Union of South Africa will
recognise that if the U.N.O. Conference is any index of world opinion, it is decidedly
against the European prejudice which has hardened into law.

Referri ng to the news about the Union Government’s refusal of passports and
impounding the certificates of identity of Drs. Dadoo and Naicker, Gandhiji said:
"The Union Government will not be able to sustain their anti -Asiatic policy by
such an action."
He ad ded that the action was wholly unwarranted and arbitrary if the facts stated in the
cablegram he had received in this connection were correct.
Gandhiji hoped that either there were some justifying peremptory reasons for the refusal
and impounding or that second thoughts would convince the Government that it was a
hasty step and therefore it would be cancelled.

National Congress have decided on their part to refrain from taking part in or in any
manner assistin g in the celebrations in honour of the Royal visit to the Union of South
Africa. They feel that in view of the disabilities imposed upon the Asiatics and Africans
and other Coloured people it would be improper on their part to share in the rejoicings of
the white people of South Africa. The cablegram asked me to endorse the abstention
which they describe by the name of "boycott." I take this opportunity of publicly
endorsing the abstention as a natural and dignified step by any self -respecting body of
peopl e.

Truly speaking, it was after I went to South Africa that I became what I am now. My love
for South Africa and my co ncern for her problems are no less than for India, because it
was in South Africa that I discovered the weapon of satyagraha , and it was there that I

Sheth Cachalia,368Honorary Secretary of the Transvaal Indian Congress, cabled me for a
message on the rally which was to take place in Johannesburg of all the non -European
races in the Union of South Africa on the question of racial disabilities in the Union.369
The question is most intricate and almost baffling. It is intricate enough when confined

369A "UNO Rally" -jointly sponsored by the African National Congress, the Transvaal Indian Congress
and the Transvaal branch of the African People’s Org anisation -took place in Johannesburg on May 4,
1947. It was one of the largest demonstrations of the non -European people until that time.only to the Indian dis abilities but the inclusion of all the races while logically correct is
fraught with grave danger, if the struggle is not kept at the highest level and is not firmly
based on truth and non -violence. I wanted to warn the organisers of the rally against
rhetorical display or raising idle hopes and to advise them to carry on their demonstration
with dignity and restraint. Let no one doubt that the salvation of all the exploited peoples
of the earth and, therefore, of the world, lies in the strictest reliance o n the coin on whose
one face is written truth and on the other non -violence in large letters. Sixty years of
experience has taught me no other method.

235. MESSAGE TO SOUTH AFRICA, MAY 18, 1947370
Field Marshal Smuts371is a trustee for Western civilisation. I still cling to the hope that
he will not sustain it on the suppression of Asiatics and Africans. South Africa should
present a blend of the three.
To the peop le of South Africa, to whom I am no stranger, I would say that they should
not make the position of their representatives impossible by their unwarranted prejudice
against colour. The future is surely not with the so -called white races if they keep
themsel ves in purdah. The attitude of unreason will mean a third war which sane people
should avoid. Political co -operation among all the exploited races in South Africa can
only result in mutual goodwill, if it is wisely directed and based on truth and non -
viole nce.
I have no doubt that those South African Indians who seek to create a division will do
harm to themselves and to the great cause of liberty for which the movement of
satyagraha has stood and must stand.
To the satyagrahis I would advise strict adh erence to the fundamentals of satyagraha
which literally means force of truth and this is for ever invincible. It is a good sign that
they have a progressive European group solidly behind them. The satyagrahis of South
Africa should know that they have Ind ia at their back in their struggle for preserving the
self-respect of the Indians in South Africa.

237. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI, JULY 17, 1947
We learn from newspapers that the Indians in South Africa are being subjected to
goondaism. They are being killed.373
I was in South Africa for twenty years and I know how Indians are treated in that country.
There is a large number of Mus lims there but they all call themselves Indians. May God
give us all the sense at least to call ourselves Indians when we are in a foreign country.
Recently Sarup374had been to the United Nations along with Justice Chagla375and others
to present before the world body the case of the South Africa Indians. Since then
harassment of Indians in South Africa has taken a new form. It is not the law that has
been unleashed against them but goondaism. If this goes on, how will the handful of
Indians be able to live there? Once I marched into the Transvaal with two thousand
372Mr. Kajee sought a compromise with the government and formed the Natal Indian Organisation on May
4, 1947.
Gandhiji wrote to Manilal on July 16, 1947:
"I have had a letter from Kajee. He has complained against Dadoo and others. The letter is a long one.
However, it has produced no effect on me, for have we not had similar experiences in the past?"
(Collected Works , Volume 88, pages 348 -49).
373The reference is appar ently to the boycott of Indian traders, organised by some whites in the Transvaal
at the beginning of 1947, with threats of violence against those who patronised them.

drink. We have plenty of water here. But it is not in such abundance there. People collect
water when it rains an d keep it stored in tanks. The Boers were friendly and we went
wherever we wanted. But I see a different picture today. Now that we have two
Governments here, I shall ask Mr. Jinnah and Jawaharlal to send a joint telegram to
Smuts. Mr. Smuts considers me h is friend. As a friend I must entreat him to tell the
Whites not to do physical violence to even one single Indian. And if he cannot make
himself obeyed, he must resign. Lord Mountbatten too should not helplessly watch. He is
an Admiral of the Fleet and is of Royal family. Philip Mountbatten, who is going to
marry Princess Elizabeth, is like a son to him. Besides, upto the 15th of August he will be
the Viceroy and afterwards the Governor -General. He should therefore make use of these
advantages and tell Smu ts that India is now a Dominion even as South Africa is, that it is
now a member of the vast family that is the British Commonwealth and that the ill -
treatment of Indians in South Africa should forthwith stop...
My advice to South African Indians is that they should live there as good citizens. Those
of them who are wealthy should not neglect their Muslim376brethren who are like
untouchables there.

...Q: What effect do you think the failure of th e U.N.O. to deal justly with the South
African -Indian dispute will have on the future of that organisation?
376The word "Muslim" is apparently an error here. The reference is probably to "poorer" Indians, since all
Indians were treated like untouchables.
377The Joint Passive Resistance Council had decided to expand resistance from October 13th. Only token
resistance had been carried on since the United Nations resolution of December 1946.Gandhiji: If the U.N.O. fails to deal justly with the South African -Indian dispute, the
U.N.O. will lose its prestige. I have no doubt that the U. N.O. can prosper only if it is just.
Q:And what will be the effect of the failure on the world?
G: About the effect on the world no one knows. At least I do not.
Q:Racial equality must be removed if there is to be peace in the world. What is your
advice to those who agree with this but do nothing to fight the evil of racial inequality?
G: Those who agree that racial inequality must be removed and yet do nothing to fight
the evil are impotent. I cannot have anything to say to such people. After all the
underdogs will have to earn their own salvation.
Q:What remedy do you propose for the elimination of racial prejudice and antagonism
from the affairs of nations?
G: The solution is largely in India’s hands. If everything is alright in India inter nally, she
is likely to play an effective part in straightening out affairs...378

I have received a telegram from South Africa. I t says that I have done them a great favour.
What favour have I done? I have merely stated what I believe to be good.379This is one
great thing about satyagraha ... What does it matter if there are only a handful of people
in South Africa? How can there be m illions to offer satyagraha ? In any case, the
population there is only a few lakhs. Even if a few hundred, even if only ten persons,
come forward, they will add to the prestige of India. They ask me why I do not also
request the people here to send money. That pains me. They are not poor people. They
have gone to South Africa to make money. They have not gone there to oblige us. Those
who are carrying on the struggle there do not have much money, and the moneyed people
378This item was also publish ed on November 13, 1947, in Passive Resister (Johannesburg) which
indicated that it was an interview with a correspondent of the All India Radio, and included the following
question and answer:
Q: In the case the U.N.O. fails to do justice to the Indians in South Africa, what line of action would you
advise the South African Indians to take?
G: I cannot even think of failure in Satyagraha . It never fails. This is my firm belief.
379A report on this speech in Passive Resister , Johannesburg, November 194 7, has "the truth" instead of
"good."do not give them anything. Those who o wn money begin to love only money. They see
their honour and respect only in money. Our people in South Africa say they are fighters,
but don’t have much money. If they don’t have money, how have they carried on so far?
There is a large number of our peo ple in East Africa. The entire East Coast is full of our
people. I would ask them to send money. Our country is almost impoverished today.
With what face can I ask anybody here to send money? We do have millionaires in our
country and they make millions to o, but even they are left with little money because of
heavy taxation. And to our misfortune the people are fighting among themselves, and that
also results in the loss of millions. How can I ask them to spare money for South Africa?
When I was in South Af rica people from here used to send money. Gokhale380used to
send money. The Punjab and the whole of India had sent me something between 5 and 7
lakhs. I don’t think I can ask people to do any such thing today. There are many Indians
in Mauritius. They are c oolies there. There is no communal problem in that place. There
is a large number of Indians in Mombasa. They are pretty rich. They do not drink, nor do
they go to prostitutes. They need money only for their food. How much money does one
need for food? Our people in South Africa can say they are fighting not for themselves
but for India. Of course, I cannot stop people from sending money there, but I cannot ask
them to do so either.381

241. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER
1947
"Anti -colour prejudice in South Africa" was criticised by Gandhiji in his speech after one
of his prayer meetings last week.
"India has come into the British Commonwealth with exactly the same status as the
Union of South Africa. Should members of one Dominion be helots in another
Dominion?"
Gandhiji quoted from a message which he said had been sent to the Natal Indian
Congress in Durban five days after the independence of India. This he described as
"typical of the average white man’s mind in the South African Dominion."
The message, said Gandhiji, had been sent by Dr. S. P. Barnard, Administrator of the
Free State. It said: "As you are celebrating the independence of the new Dominions,
380Gopal Krishna Gokhale
381of rupeeswhich you consider a great day in the annals of Indian history, I hope all Indians in South
Africa will now emigrate voluntarily to the new Dominions to act as missionaries of the
Gospel they have been taught in South Africa, namely, to live in peace and order and not
to fight in communal riots in which hundreds have been killed in India."
Gandhiji said South Africa had a large Native population who were treated in some
respects worse than Asiatic inhabitants. He added:
"I urge Europe an settlers there to read the signs of the times. Either their prejudices
are wrong from every point of view, or the British people and their fellow members
of the British Commonwealth have made an unpardonable mistake in admitting
Asiatic countries as mem bers of the Commonwealth."

Chi. Medh
...The news you convey from there382is startling. Yet not quite so. I know our people
there too well to be startled by the news. And I am alarmed that we have not yet learnt the
true lesson. Are we ever going to learn it? How can I guide you from this distance? And
where do I have the energy for that? Weigh everything on the scales of truth and non -
violence and follow t he resultant verdict. And don’t be afraid. It should never turn out
that you had gone there to exploit and instead you were yourself exploited. The best way
is not to bother about what any "ism" says but to associate yourself with any action after

Now about South Afr ica. You will have seen what Vijayalakshmi Pandit has said. She
says we have been defeated because we have not been able to secure the required two -

383Dr. Y. M. Dadoo was a leader of the Communist Party of South Africa.thirds of votes.384However, a number of people have been helpful and supported her
stand. Besides, truth is o n our side and in a way we have secured a victory.385The Indians
in South Africa should therefore not be disheartened. But there is something I have to say.
Vijayalakshmi could not have said it because she represented the Government of India.
You do not hav e a remedy but I have one which I had applied in South Africa. What is
defeat or victory? The whites of South Africa and Smuts386may say that they do not want
us there, that we must leave. They may deny us food and water as is happening to non -
Muslims in Pa kistan and to Muslims in India...
What I have to say here applies also to the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs in South Africa. I
must tell them that victory and defeat are of no consequence. You must say that you will
live in South Africa with honour, that you will not leave. You did not go there because
you wanted to. You were invited. You went as indentured labourers and afterwards you
had children there. If it is a question of rights no one except the Negroes have a right to
be there. The Boers do not have e ven as much right as you have. There were delegations
from all over the world at the U.N.O. Our country also had to send a delegation. We
acted rightly. People assemble there to bring about justice; that they cannot or will not is
another matter. We must c ontinue our fight in South Africa, not with a sword but with
soul force... So I shall say that if the Indians in South Africa have self -respect which I
think they have, if they have courage, they must say that even if they did not secure two -
third of the votes at the U.N.O., they did secure a very large number. They must tell the
whites of South Africa to let them stay in the country with honour. They must tell them
they intend to conduct themselves with dignity. They do not want government service.
They d o not expect help from the whites but they must be allowed to breathe the air,
drink the water and live on the land. After all they pay their way, earn their keep,
wherever they want to stay. They do not claim the right to vote. If they want the vote they
must have it the same way as the whites have it, otherwise they will do without it. They
will not carry on satyagraha for franchise but they must safeguard their dignity. They
must have bread and they must have water and they must have land. Also their chi ldren
must have education. They will understand if no grants are forthcoming for the purpose
but the education for the children is their right and they have the right to fight for this. It
is not a question of victory or defeat but of laying down one’s lif e. They must do or die.
There is no other recourse. If they want to live in this world in dignity they must do or die.
Their duty is clear and admits of no argument. This is what I have to say to the Indians of
South Africa and to you. I have nothing else to offer.

384At the second session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947, an Indian reso lution calling for
a Round Table Conference on the treatment of Indians in South Africa failed to obtain the requisite two -
third majority: there were 31 votes in favour, 19 against and 6 abstentions, with one country absent.
385Mrs. Vijayalakshmi Pandit h ad said: "Ours has been a moral victory of no small importance."
386Field Marshal Jan Christiaan Smuts, Prime Minister of South Africa244. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI, JANUARY 28, 1948
...You know in South Africa our people are fighting for their rights. Here in India t here
are no laws depriving the people of the right of owning land or living wherever they
please. It is true we have reduced Harijan s to some such condition but for the rest of
society that is not so. But I have seen with my own eyes that that is so in Sou th Africa.
The Indians therefore are having to put up a struggle to safeguard their rights and in
defence of the honour of India. They can resort to various means in their struggle but they
claim to be satyagrahis and their struggle has taken the form of satyagraha . They keep
on sending cables. They cannot even move from one province to another without a permit.
South Africa is like a continent. It is a very large country. Indians wishing to go to the
Transvaal from Natal can do so only if they have a permi t. They say it is as much their
country as anyone else’s and ask why there should be such restrictions imposed on their
movements. Many have succeeded in moving to the Transvaal and the Government this
time have been decent. They have not been arrested so far. They first went to Volksrust
which is the first city after crossing the border. There were policemen present in strength
but they only looked on and did not arrest them. There they found a motor vehicle and
proceeded in it further on. Then a meeting w as held there at which they were given a
warm welcome. I thought I should give you this information.387
Those Indians have performed an act of great courage. Indians in South Africa are few in
number but, if they all become true satyagrahis , their victory is certain and no obstacle
can stop them. But this has yet to be achieved. There are, as here, many kinds of people.
There are Hindus and there are Muslims. They all work together. They know they cannot
fight their battle separately. They have reached Joha nnesburg but they cannot stop there.
They must go on and on till they are arrested. The Government have a right to arrest them,
forsatyagraha implies the acceptance of punishment for the violation of a law. They
deserve congratulations.
I shall ask the Government of South Africa not to be too severe with people who carry on
their struggle with such decency. They should understand their grievances and come to a
settlement with them. Why should it be that one with a white skin cannot have a dialogue
with o ne with a black skin? Why should Indians have to fight for their legitimate rights?
How does it harm the whites if Indians too are allowed to live there? Today we are also a
free country as South Africa is and are members of the same Commonwealth, which
implies that we should all live like brothers and equals. But if they consider Indians their
enemies and deprive them of their basic civic rights, then they are not behaving as friends
387A new stage of the passive resistance campaign was begun on January 15, 1948, with defiance of the
restrictions on i nter-provincial movement by Indians under the Immigration Act of 1913. Twenty -five
volunteers crossed the Natal -Transvaal border on that day, but were not arrested.
None of the volunteers was arrested until February 10th. Shortly after, Dr. Y. M. Dadoo a nd Dr. G. M.
Naicker were charged with organising the defiance of the Immigration Act and were each sentenced to six
months’ imprisonment with hard labour.but as enemies. It is something which is difficult to understand. Why sho uld they look
down on the Coloured people? Is it because they are industrious and thrifty? I shall tell
the Government of South Africa through this meeting that it should men its ways. I have
myself lived in South Africa for twenty years and I can therefor e say that it is my country.

THE SMUTS -GANDHI AGREEMENT, JUNE 30, 1914
(The agreement consists of a letter from E. M. Gorges, Secretary of the Ministry of the
Interior, to Gandhiji on behalf of the Minister of the Interior, General J. C. Smuts, and
the reply of Gandhiji)
Letter from E. M. Gorges to Gandhiji
Cape Town,
June 30, 1914
Dear Mr. Gandhi,
Adverting to the discussions you have lately had with General Smuts on the subject of
the position of the Indian community in the Union, at the first of which you expressed
yourself as sati sfied with the provisions of the Indians` Relief Bill and accepted it as a
definite settlement of the points, which required legislative action, at issue between that
community and the Government; and at the second of which you submitted for the
considerat ion of the Government a list of other matters requiring administrative action,
over and above those specifically dealt with in that Bill; I am desired by General Smuts to
state with reference to those matters that:
1. He sees no difficulty in arr anging that the Protector of Indian Immigrants in Natal
will in future issue to every Indian, who is subject to the provisions of Natal Act 17 of
1895, on completion of his period of indenture, or re -indenture, a certificate of discharge,
free of charge, s imilar in form to that issued under the provisions of Section 106 of Natal
Law No. 25 of 1891.
2. On the question of allowing existing plural wives and the children of such wives to
join their husbands (or fathers) in South Africa, no difficulty will be raised by the
Government if, on enquiry, it is found, as you stated, that the number is a very limited
one.
3. In administering the provisions of Section (4) (1) (a) of the Union Immigrants`
Regulation Act, No. 22 of 1913, the practice hitherto exi sting at the Cape will be
continued in respect of South Africa -born Indians who seek to enter the Cape Province,
so long as the movement of such persons to that Province assumes no greater dimensions
than has been the case in the past; the Government, howe ver, reserve the right, as soon as
the number of such entrants sensibly increase, to apply the provisions of the Immigration
Act.
4. In the case of the "specially exempted educated entrants into the Union" (i.e., the
limited number who will be allowed by the Government to enter the Union each year forsome purpose connected with the general welfare of the Indian community), the
declarations to be made by such persons will not be required at Provincial borders, as the
general declarations which are made in terms of Section 19 of the Immigrants`
Regulation Act at the port of entry are sufficient.
5. Those Indians who have been admitted within the last three years, either to the Cape
Province or Natal, after passing the education tests imposed by the Immigration Laws
which were in force therein prior to the coming into effect of Act 22 of 1913, but who, by
reason of the wording of Section 20 thereof, are not regarded as being "domiciled" in the
sense in which that term is defined in the Section in ques tion, shall, in the event of their
absenting themselves temporarily from the Province in which they are lawfully resident,
be treated, on their return, as if the term "domicile" as so defined did apply to them.
6. He will submit to the Minister of Justice the cases of those persons who have in the
past been convicted of " bona fide passive resistance offences" (a term which is mutually
understood) and that he anticipates no objection on Mr. De Wet's part to the suggestion
that convictions for such offences will not be used by the Government against such
persons in the future.
7. A document will be issued to every "specially exempted educated entrant" who is
passed by the Immigration Officers under the instructions of the Minister issued under
Section 25 of Act No. 22 of 1913.
8. All the recommendations of the Indian Grievances Commission enumerated at the
conclusion of their Report, which remain over and above the points dealt with in the
Indians` Relief Bill, will be adopted by the Government;
andsubject to the stipulation contained in the last paragraph of this letter the necessary
further action in regard to those matters will be issued without delay.
With regard to the administration of existing laws, the Minister desires me to say that it
always has been and will continue to be the desire of the Government to see that they are
administered in a just manner and with due regard to vested rights.
In conclusion, General Smuts desires me to say that it is, of course, understood, and he
wishes no doubts on the subject to remain, that the placing of the Indians` Relief Bill on
the Statute Book of the Union, coupled with the fulfilment of the assurances he is giving
in this letter in regard to the other matters referred to herein, touched upon at the recent
interviews, will constitute a complete and final settlement of the controversy which has
unfortunately existed for so long, and will be unreservedly accepted as such by the Indian
community.
I am, etc.,

M. K. Gandhi, Esq.Cape Town
Letter from Gandhiji to E. M. Gorges
Cape Town,
June 30, 1914
Dear Mr. Gorges,
I beg to acknowled ge receipt of your letter of even date herewith setting forth the
substance of the interview that General Smuts was pleased, notwithstanding many other
pressing calls upon his time, to grant me on Saturday last. I feel deeply grateful for the
patience and courtesy which the Minister showed during the discussion of the several
points submitted by me.
The passing of the Indians` Relief Bill and this correspondence finally closes the
passive resistance struggle which commenced in the September of 1906 and which to the
Indian community cost much physical suffering and pecuniary loss and the Government
much anxious thought and consideration.
As the Minister is aware, some of my countrymen have wished me to go further. They
are dissatisfied that the trad e licences laws of the different provinces, the Transvaal Gold
Law, the Transvaal Townships Act, the Transvaal Law 3 of 1885 have not been altered,
so as to give them full rights of residence, trade and ownership of land. Some of them are
dissatisfied that full inter -provincial migration is not permitted, and some are dissatisfied
that, on the marriage question, the Relief Bill goes no further than it does. They have
asked me that all the above matters might be included in the passive resistance struggle. I
have been unable to comply with their wishes. Whilst, therefore, they have not been
included in the programme of passive resistance, it will not be denied that some day or
other these matters will require further and sympathetic consideration by the
Gover nment. Complete satisfaction cannot be expected until full civic rights have been
conceded to the resident Indian population. I have told my countrymen that they will
have to exercise patience and by all honourable means at their disposal educate public
opinion so as to enable the Government of the day to go further than the present
correspondence does. I shall hope that, when the Europeans of South Africa fully
appreciate the fact that now, as the importation of indentured labour from India is
prohibited a nd as the Immigration Regulation Act of last year has in practice all but
stopped further free Indian immigration and that my countrymen do not aspire to any
political ambition, they, the Europeans, will see the justice and, indeed, the necessity of
my cou ntrymen being granted the rights I have just referred to.
Meanwhile, if the generous spirit that the Government have applied to the treatment of
the problem during the past few months continues to be applied, as promised in your
letter, in the adminis tration of the existing laws, I am quite certain that the Indiancommunity throughout the Union will be able to enjoy some measure of peace and never
be a source of trouble to the Government.
I am,
Yours faithfully,

LETTER DATED JULY 7, 1914, FROM GANDHIJI TO E. M.
GORGES
Phoenix,
Natal,
July 7, 1914
Dear Mr. Gorges,
I have now got a moment to submit my note upon the Gold Law. As you know, after
maturer consideration, I refrained from pressing for the insertion of a special clause
defining "vested rights" in connection with the Gold Law and Townships Amendment
Act, because I felt that any definition in the correspondence might result in restricting the
future action of my countrymen. However, so far as my interpretation of "vested rights"
is concerned, I think that I shall reduce it to writing. General Smuts was good enough to
say that he would endeavour to protect vested rights as defined by me. The following is
the definition I submitted to Sir Benjamin Robertson, who, I understood, submitted it to
General Sm uts. My letter containing, among other matters, the definition, is dated the 4th
March, 1914.388"By ‘vested rights’ I understand the right of an Indian and his successors
to live and trade in the townships in which he was living and trading, no matter how o ften
he shifts his residence or business from place to place in the same township." I am
fortified in my interpretation by the answer given by Mr. Harcourt in connection with the
matter, in the House of Commons, on the 27th June, 1911:
Complaints agai nst that legislation (the Gold Law and Townships Amendment Act)
have been made and are now being investigated by the Government of the Union of
South Africa, who have lately stated that there is no intention of interfering with any
388Letter to Benjamin Robertson in Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi , Volume 12, p.
371business or right to car ry on business acquired and exercised by Indians prior to the date
of the legislation.
I have also now traced the note by Mr. de Villiers which I alluded to in our
conversation. It is contained in a White Paper published in London in March, 1912, and
has the following:
No right or privilege which a Coloured person has at the present time is taken away by
the new Act (Act 35 of 1908).
And again,
Section 131, which, before the Bill was introduced into Parliament, formed the subject
of question s in the English House of Commons and of despatches from the Secretary of
State to the Governor, has been amended in Committee so as to safeguard any rights
which a Coloured person may, at the present time, have of occupying land in mining
areas.
Certainly, prior to the passing of the Gold Law, no restrictions were, to my knowledge,
placed upon the movement or the trade of British Indians in the Gold Areas. There can,
therefore, be no justification for any restriction now, especially in regard to those who are
already settled in their respective townships.
I am,
Yours truly,
M. K. Gandhi

APPENDIX III
THE CA PE TOWN AGREEMENT, 1927
Joint Communiqué issued by the South African and Indian Governments, February 21,
1927
1. It was announced in April, 1926, that the Government of India and the Government
of the Union of South Africa had agreed to hold a Roun d Table Conference to explore all
possible methods of settling the Indian question in the Union in a manner which wouldsafeguard the maintenance of Western standards of life in South Africa by just and
legitimate means. The Conference assembled at Cape To wn on December 17th and its
session finished on January 12th. There was, in these meetings, a full and frank exchange
of views which has resulted in a truer appreciation of mutual difficulties and a united
understanding to co -operate in the solution of a c ommon problem in a spirit of
friendliness and goodwill.
Both Governments affirm their recognition of the right of South Africa to use all just
and legitimate means for the maintenance of Western standards of life.
2. The Union Government recognis es that Indians domiciled in the Union who are
prepared to conform to Western standards of life, should be enabled to do so.
3. For those Indians in the Union who may desire to avail themselves of it, the Union
Government will organise a scheme of ass isted emigration to India or other countries
where Western standards are not required. Union domicile will be lost after three years’
continuous absence from the Union, in agreement with the proposed revision of the law
relating to domicile which will be o f general application. Emigrants under the assisted
emigration scheme who desire to return to the Union within three years will only be
allowed to do so on refund to the Union Government of the cost of assistance received by
them.
4. The Government of India recognise their obligation to look after such emigrants on
their arrival in India.
5. The admission into the Union of the wives and minor children of Indians
permanently domiciled in the Union will be regulated by paragraph 3 of Resolution XXI
of the Imperial Conference of 1918.
6. In the expectation that the difficulties with which the Union has been confronted
will be materially lessened by the agreement now happily reached between the two
Governments, and in order that the agreement may come into operation under the most
favourable auspices and have a fair trial, the Government of the Union of South Africa
have decided not to proceed further with the Areas Reservation and Immigration and
Registration (Further Provision) Bill.
7. The two Governments have agreed to watch the working of the agreement now
reached and to exchange views from time to time as to any changes that experience may
suggest.
8. The Government of the Union of South Africa have requested the Government of
India to appoint an agent in order to secure continuous and effective co -operation
between the two Governments.

Conference is omitted here).

EPIGRAPH 
“I love your Christ but I hate your Christians beca use your Christians are 
unlike your Christ” Gandhi 
What...does Jesus mean to me? To me, He was one of the 
greatest teachers humanity has ever had. To His bel ievers, He 
was God’s only begotten Son. Could the fact that I do or do not 
accept this belief make Jesus have any more or less  influence in 
my life? Is all the grandeur of His teaching and of  His doctrine 
to be forbidden to me? I cannot believe so. (Gandhi , MR, Oct. 
1941, p. 406-7)

FOREWORD 
We are living in a sick and confused age. An age wh en people talk of peace but 
prepare for war; an age that preaches love but pois ons people’s minds with 
hatred; an age that talks about the inalienable rig hts of every created human 
being but upholds the might of the rich, the powerf ul and the privileged as the 
only right there is; an age that preaches harmony a mong men but sows the 
seeds of discord and rebellion; an age that talks a bout people’s rights – the 
right to life, the right to work, the right to just ice and so forth, but tramples 
upon those rights with impunity; an age that talks about freedom but keeps 
millions of innocent human beings in social, religi ous, economic and political 
bondage; an age when different races, different cou ntries and different people 
are duly united by the wonders of science and techn ology into a global village 
but are unduly fragmented into citadels of mistrust , terrorism, ethnic conflicts, 
fratricidal strife and shameful genocides by man’s greed and folly; an age that 
preaches God but worships mammon; an age that can b oast of having 
everything that can make life easy, joyful and comf ortable but lacks the peace 
that can sustain all that man claims he has. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 8 My love for the enigmatic Hindu Saint, Mahatma Gand hi, is boundless. This love 
grew out of the abundance of my admiration for a ma n who was able to do, and 
to do it to perfection, that which most men and wom en know to be the right 
thing and would have loved to do but have not been able to do and may never 
be able to do. Simply put, I love Mahatma Gandhi be cause, though a Hindu by 
religious profession, it is he who made Jesus Chris t more real to me. 
Gandhi’s supreme sacrifice for humanity, his boundl ess forbearance for the 
failings of humanity, his nonviolent approach to th e inestimable violent acts of 
man’s inhumanity to man, his inability to hate or e ven to be angry in the face 
of extreme provocation and his love for those who d id everything possible to 
destroy him and his people convinced me more than a nything else that an 
ordinary mortal, mere flesh and blood, can still ec ho those redeeming words of 
Christ – “Father forgive them for the do not what t hey are doing.”  
Before I read deep into the life of this great man I entertained the vague notion 
that the excruciating agonies of Jesus Christ which  culminated in his supreme 
sacrifice on the cross and the generous dispensatio n of his persecutors were all 
veiled in the mystery of divinity. Then, came the G andhian poser: If Christ is 
divine, Gandhi is human. If this human Gandhi, who was a Hindu, could be 
inspired by the supreme sacrifice of the Cross to d o what he did to make this 
world a better place, then, it is still possible fo r mere flesh and blood to live out 
the message of the Cross.  
Millions of people all over the world loved Gandhi long before ever our own 
generation came to be. Millions of people will cont inue to love him as long as the 
world lasts. And this love grows deeper and deeper with the passage of every day 
because Gandhi is so positively different. He is an other of God’s special message 
to humanity. 
In an age when religion, that which should bind us together and then link us to 
God, has turned out to be one of the most deadly ti me-bombs that threaten 
peace and the harmonious co-existence of people of different faiths, Gandhi 
demonstrated with his life that religious intoleran ce is an affront to God. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 9 In an age when the inordinate pursuit of wealth and  undue attachment to 
material things make the rich and the powerful blin d to the cry of the poor and 
the weak, Gandhi discarded everything he owned to b e free to surrender himself 
for the good of the downtrodden. 
In an age when people measure their greatness by th e enormous power they can 
wield, the number of people they can suppress, the estate they can command 
and the wealth they can display, Gandhi chose to ta ke up the identity of the 
poorest and the lowliest people in order to raise t hem from the dungeon of 
oppression and despair and give them hope. 
When Winston Churchill, the proud and powerful Brit ish leader bragged that India 
would complacently remain under the afflictions of British oppression and 
exploitation, Mahatma Gandhi liberated India with t he healing power of truth, 
love, redemptive suffering and nonviolent resistanc e. 
In an age that has replaced the message of the Cros s with the threat of imminent 
nuclear annihilation, Gandhi chose to make his life  a living Cross. Convinced that 
the life-style of many of the Christians of his tim e was a negation of the eternal 
teaching of Christ, he declared: “I love Christ but  do not like your Christians.” In 
Gandhi, therefore, God raised a Hindu to remind the  world of the eternal 
message of the Cross. 
These and many more constitute my love for Gandhi. They constitute Fr. Jude 
Langeh’s love for him. They constitute the love peo ple all over the world have for 
him. Somewhere along the line, this infectious love  for Gandhi brought Fr. 
Langeh and me together, making it possible for me t o become a part of this 
book. 
As a student at the Claretian Institute of Philosop hy, Nekede, Owerri, Imo 
State, Nigeria, Fr. Langeh came across some of my b ooks, particularly the book 
on Gandhi. After reading it, he developed the type of interest I developed on 
the same Gandhi after reading about him many years ago. Besides, he wanted 
to know more about the author of the book. This mar ked the beginning of our 
friendship. When he made the decision to write his degree dissertation on 
Gandhi’s doctrine of nonviolence, he visited and st ayed many days in my parish Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 10 to enable him complete his research work in my libr ary. This book is the 
offshoot of that dissertation. 
Mahatma Gandhi is God’s message to a world wounded by greed, reckless abuse 
of power and violence and by all the inequities men tioned at the beginning of 
this brief introduction. Those who have received th e message and are 
interested in making the world, particularly Africa , a better place have an 
obligation to spread it. 
That is precisely what Fr. Langeh has done by writi ng this book. The book is a 
brief account of the life and message of the man be hind what is undoubtedly the 
greatest and the most challenging moral epic of our  time. By writing the book, Fr. 
Langeh is repeating in his own way what Martin Luth er King, Junior declared after 
reading about Gandhi’s life: “Christ furnished the spirit and motivation (of 
nonviolent resistance against evil) and Gandhi furn ished the method.”. 
The Relevance of Gandhi’s Doctrine of Nonviolence  deserves the attention of 
all who are interested in our common good as a peop le and the future of 
generations yet to be born. It is an invaluable tre asure for gaining a better 
understanding of the indispensable role of peace in  the arduous task of building a 
better society and strengthening our fraternal soli darity. Its message beckons all 
of us to commit our material and spiritual resource s to the search for peace 
through nonviolent resistance. 
It is my privilege that Fr. Langeh has asked me to be a part of the book by 
introducing it to the public. I have done that with  please. I sincerely thank him 
for giving me that honour and congratulate him for a job well done.

PREFACE 
 
GANDHI 
ou l’avenir de l’humain 
Dans un monde où la violence des hommes et des nati ons a atteint des niveaux 
qui font craindre la disparition de la vie sur terr e et l’anéantissement de tout 
ce que l’humanité a créé de beau, de grand, de magn ifique et de merveilleux 
au cours des siècles, un livre sur la non-violence est toujours une bonne 
nouvelle à accueillir. Celui que vous allez lire l’ est à plus d’un titre et sous 
plusieurs angles. 
Il l’est d’abord parce qu’il nous replonge dans la pensée  de l’homme qui, dans 
les temps contemporains, a fait de la non-violence non pas seulement une 
théorie fondamentale  à promouvoir, mais une pratiq ue décisive de 
transformation profonde de des esprits et des struc tures sociales : le Mahtama 
Gandhi. De cet homme exceptionnel, l’auteur du prés ent livre présente avec 
force les intuitions spirituelles et les lignes dir ectrices de pensée et d’action. Il 
montre à quel point l’idée de la non-violence et se s orientations de vie telles 
que Gandhi les a développées sont un socle pour bât ir le seul monde qui vaut la 
peine d’être construit de nos jours : le monde de l ’amour dans toutes ses 
virtualités d’humanisation des hommes et des peuple s.   
Ce livre est également une bonne nouvelle parce qu’ il est écrit par un jeune 
prêtre catholique qui interprète Gandhi sur la base  de ce que le message de 
Jésus-Christ a de radical dans sa compréhension de l’amour et dans la 
valorisation de la force d’aimer, pour reprendre l’ expression de Martin Luther 
King. Quand on inscrit la non-violence dans la dyna mique globale de l’amour au 
sens le plus profond que le Christ lui donne, on co mprend que Gandhi ne s’est 
pas adressé seulement à son propre peuple  dans un contexte de libération 
politique de l’Inde, mais à toutes les nations dont  la non-violence représente 
une sorte de condensé très fertile de ce que l’hist oire a comme graines de Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 12 spiritualité pour faire de chaque personne un vrai être humain et de la société 
un lieu d’humanité véritable. Quand un chrétien lit  et comprend Gandhi selon 
cette perspective, comme le fait ici le Révérend Pè re Jude Thaddeus Lamgeh 
Basebang, il offre une contribution de grande valeu r à notre monde actuel 
dominé par les violences les plus barbares et les p lus sauvages, un monde où il 
est important et indispensable de poser la non-viol ence comme un nouveau 
fondement de civilisation. 
Son livre est aussi une bonne nouvelle pour le cont inent africain. Depuis un 
demi-millénaire déjà, ce continent est dominé par l a violence. Son histoire est 
une histoire de larmes et de sang, de sueur et de t raumatismes, depuis les 
affres de l’esclavage jusqu’à l’actuelle mondialisa tion qui n’augure pas d’autre 
chose pour l’avenir que l’intensification exponenti elle des violences. 
Aujourd’hui même, l’actualité africaine est tissée par ces violences : la 
violence des armes, la violence des identités triba les meurtrières, la violence 
des pouvoirs despotiques, la violence des misères s ans fin, la violence du 
désespoir dû aux injustices, aux inégalités et aux dénis des droits humains 
partout dans nos pays. Dans un tel contexte, la bon ne nouvelle de la non-
violence n’est pas seulement une nécessité, c’est u ne urgence vitale. Le 
Révérend Père Basebang a compris cette urgence et s on livre en répand le 
souffle avec un réel bonheur. Au sortir d’un tel li vre, il est clair que l’Afrique 
de l’avenir ne peut pas se construire sur un autre socle que celui de la non-
violence telle que Gandhi et telle qu’elle s’inscri t dans la fécondité de 
l’Evangile de Jésus-Christ. 
Dans la mesure où le livre du Révérend Père Baseban g se nourrit de tout le suc 
politique de la non-violence, il est une bonne nouv elle pour l’éducation des 
générations montantes, celles qui ont leur avenir à  construire et qui ne doivent 
pas se laisser dominées par la civilisation actuell e de la violence et de la 
destruction. Aujourd’hui plus que jamais, en Afriqu e comme partout dans le 
monde, c’est à l’éthique de la non-violence que dev ra être consacrée 
prioritairement  l’éducation de la jeunesse. L’aven ir en dépend et il y a 
urgence. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 13 Avec une telle éthique, on peut imaginer qu’un  aut re type de politique sera 
possible : la politique de l’humain. Un autre type d’économie sera possible : 
l’économie du bonheur partagé. Un autre type de cul ture sera possible : la 
culture des solidarités responsables à l’échelle de s personnes, des peuples, des 
cultures et des civilisations.  
Nous devons exprimer une profonde reconnaissance au  Révérend Père Basebang 
d’avoir mis en lumière ces exigences fondamentales de l’humain à partir de la 
pensée de Ganhi.

BIOGRAPHY OF MAHATMA GANDHI 
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1 869 in Porbandar, India. 
He became one of the most respected spiritual and p olitical leaders of the 
1900’s. Gandhi helped free the Indian people from B ritish rule through 
nonviolent resistance, and is honoured by Indians a s the father of the Indian 
Nation. He was highly influenced by Thoreau, Tolsto y, Ruskin, and above all the 
life of Jesus Christ. The Bible, precisely the Serm on of the Mount and the 
Bagavad –Gita had a great influence on him. The Ind ian people called Gandhi 
‘Mahatma’, meaning Great Soul. At the age of 13 Gan dhi married Kasturba, a 
girl the same age. Their parents arranged the marri age. The Gandhis had four 
children. Gandhi studied law in London and returned  to India in 1891 to 
practice. In 1893 he took on a one-year contract to  do legal work in South 
Africa. 
At the time the British controlled South Africa (th ough South Africa as such did 
not exist at that time, and the British did not con trol all of it by any means. In 
fact the Boer War (1898-1900) established the supre macy of the British over the 
Dutch (Boers) and eventually led to the Union of So uth Africa.  Gandhi served as 
a medical attendant in this war.). When he attempte d to claim his rights as a 
British subject he was abused, and soon saw that al l Indians suffered similar 
treatment. Gandhi stayed in South Africa for 21 yea rs working to secure rights 
for Indian people. He developed a method of action based upon the principles 
of courage, nonviolence and truth called Satyagraha . He believed that the way 
people behave is more important than what they achi eve. Satyagraha promoted 
nonviolence and civil disobedience as the most appr opriate methods for 
obtaining political and social goals. In 1915 Gandh i returned to India. Within 15 
years he became the leader of the Indian nationalis t movement.

Using the principles of Satyagraha he led the campa ign for Indian independence 
from Britain. Gandhi was arrested many times by the  British for his activities in 
South Africa and India. He believed it was honourab le to go to jail for a just 
cause. More than once Gandhi used fasting to impres s upon others the need to 
be nonviolent. India was granted independence in 19 47, and partitioned into 
India and Pakistan. Rioting between Hindus and Musl ims followed. Gandhi had 
been an advocate for a united India where Hindus an d Muslims lived together in 
peace. 
On January 13, 1948, at the age of 78, he began a f ast with the purpose of 
stopping the bloodshed. After 5 days the opposing l eaders pledged to stop the 
fighting and Gandhi broke his fast. Twelve days lat er a Hindu fanatic, Nathuram 
Godse who opposed his programme of tolerance for al l creeds and religion 
assassinated him. 
There are five great contributions which Mahatma Ga ndhi gave to the world as 
follows: (1)A New spirit and technique- Satyagraha;  (2) The Emphasis that the 
moral universe is one and that the morals of indivi duals, groups, and nations 
must be the same. (3)His insistence that the means and the ends must be 
consistent; (4) The fact that he held no ideals he did not embody or was not in 
the process of embodying. (5) A willingness to suff er and die for his principles. 
The greatest of these is his Satyagraha.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Apparently to many people, development and revoluti ons, which have shaken 
the world greatly, were done through violence.  For  example, The French 
Revolutions, The First and Second World wars, etc. Without really neglecting 
this, some pertinent questions have to be asked: Ha s there been real peace 
after these revolutions?  Can one use a violent mea ns to attain perfect peace 
and tranquillity?  True enough, people are still su ffering the after effects of 
wars like the loss of life and property, the denigr ation of human dignity, etc. in 
our world today we find ourselves having much affin ity to psychological and 
physical violence. 
This issue has bordered many moralists, Philosopher s and think tanks all 
through the centuries. There remains a reality that  in as much as violence has 
played a role in societal changes, there remains a philosophy and a pragmatic 
ideology, which has been affecting people. This is non other than the 
Philosophy of nonviolence. Great figures have prove n that there can be 
revolutions without violence. Prominent among these  is Mahatma Gandhi. This 
project aims at exposing the basic tenets of his Ph ilosophy of Nonviolence and 
its relevance to this our contemporary world.  
Chapter one traces the progress of violence and non violence in history.  The 
concepts of violence and nonviolence are defined an d succinctly explained.  
After this there is a short history of nonviolence from ancient to contemporary 
times.  The Chapter ends with the Basic rules of no nviolence, taking special 
note to the methods of nonviolent action and the ma nner of behaviour 
expected of a nonviolent activist. 
Chapter two exposes Gandhi’s Philosophy of nonviole nce.  Here Gandhi 
understands violence and nonviolence form their San skrit terms himsa and 
ahimsa.  The centre of Gandhi’s contribution to the Philoso phy of nonviolence, 
Satyagraha meaning Truth Force, is also treated. It s basic precepts involve 
Truth, Ahimsa and Suffering. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 21 Chapter three seeks a deeper understanding and inte rpretation of Gandhi’s 
Philosophy of nonviolence.  It is noted that Gandhi ’s Philosophy has been 
understood from an Etic (Western) and an Emic (East ern) point of view.  
Gandhi’s Philosophy has been interpreted at public and private levels; at the 
public level we have Truth, Ahimsa, Trusteeship and  Constructive action.  The 
last two gives an insight into Gandhi’s socialism a nd concern for the welfare of 
others.  At the private level we have Respect, Unde rstanding, Appreciation and 
Acceptance. The Chapter ends with the understanding  of Gandhi’s Philosophy 
of nonviolence in Politics. 
After having traced Gandhi’s Philosophy of nonviole nce, Chapter four questions 
the relevance and application of Gandhi’s Nonviolen ce leaning on some 
implications arising from his doctrines.  
Chapter five is more of an imperative affirmation. After tracing the political 
situation of most African nations, the chapter ends  with an affirmation that 
AFRICA NEEDS GANDHI. 
Stemming from Gandhi’s affirmation “I love your Chr ist but I hate your 
Christians…” Chapter six examines the relevance of Gandhi to Christendom and 
especially to the Catholic Church.  
After such a reflection one must at least seek to k now the way forward 
especially for us here in Africa. The last chapter takes care of this and is simply 
a befitting evaluation and Conclusion which brings the work to an end.

CHAPTER ONE 
 
1.0. GENERAL NOTIONS OF NONVIOLENCE 
Nonviolence is an existing theory and a practice, w hich has affected the lives of 
many people in recent times.  In a world assailed b y violence, injustice, wars 
and hatred, hopelessness and lack of vision, the gr eatest and best thing to do is 
to make a choice in life. An author holds that with  choice, “the doubt of 
personality is dispelled, and the creative self eme rges… in it, there is infinite 
interest in one’s own existence… a form of Socratic  goodness, integrity and 
self-knowledge”. 1 
In other words, in the face of a chaotic world, the re is need to choose to adopt 
a value oriented system- a system of nonviolence. B efore delving into discussing 
nonviolence, we shall first briefly discuss violenc e. 
 
1.1. What is Violence/Nonviolence? 
1.1.1. Violence 
Violence is defined as the exertion of any physical  force so as to injure or abuse 
(as in warfare), or in effecting an entrance into a  house. Violence is also 
defined as “injury in the form of revoking, repudia tion, distortion, infringement 
or irreverence to a thing, notion or quality fitly valued or observed”. 2 
The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy distinguishe s two forms of violence: 
Physical and Psychological violence. “Physical viol ence is the use of force to 
cause harm or destruction. Psychological violence i s the causing of severe 
mental or emotional harm, as through humiliation, d eprivation or brainwashing 
whether using force or not”. 3 Physical violence may be directed against 
persons, animals or property thereby causing harm, pain and suffering. 
Psychological violence applies mostly to persons.  It may be understood as the 
violation of beings worthy of respect. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 23 Violence is criminal, especially when intended. It is an act of injustice. It sows 
seeds of injustice among people. Violence generates  violence. It can never be 
the best solution to the social, political, cultura l, religious crises we may 
encounter. Violence is a means to an end. For examp le, the institution of 
apartheid in South Africa for decades was a form of  violence, which generated 
hatred, injuries, evils, etc. Ipso facto, we genera lly condemn all forms of 
violence as immoral, illicit and inadmissible.  For  Socrates, violence is not the 
best way to solve problems, even if one is wronged.  Violence is a sin against 
one’s parents and a far greater sin against one’s o wn country. 
Faced with the violence around the world today, the  best alternative is not to 
repay violence with violence, or go back to the Hob esian “Homo Homini 
Lupus”. In recent times, there has been a dramatic increase in people who have 
pursued nonviolence as a way of life. They organize  symposia, conferences and 
even write books to help people abandon violence. 
 
1.1.2. Nonviolence. 
Nonviolence is an umbrella term for describing a ra nge of methods for dealing 
with conflict, which share the common principle, th at physical violence, at 
least against other people is not used. We shall di stinguish nonviolence from 
the following.  
1 Peace action, aimed at the abolition of war as an i nstitution and the 
avoidance or termination of specific wars. Peace mo vements are 
primarily reactive to specific threats and disappea r at war’s end; 
though some like WAR RESISTERS INTERNATIONAL have s urvived since 
the First World War. 
2 Social change activism. Not everyone who professes nonviolence is 
interested in radical social transformation. 
3 One of the so-called New Social Movements (NSMs). T he wave of 
transformative collective action in post war Europe  and the US. That 
has addressed new grievances with new sources. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 24 According to Robert Holmes, Nonviolence is “the ren unciation of violence in 
personal social or international affairs. It often includes a commitment (called 
active nonviolence on nonviolent direct action) act ively opposed to violence 
(and usually evil or injustice as well), by nonviol ent means.” 4 
Nonviolence apart from being a method is also a pra gmatic ideology of bringing 
about change in the political, religious and person al sphere of life without the 
usage of violence. It is the ideal or practice of r efraining from violence on 
grounds of principle. Nonviolence is also defined a s a “doctrine of rejecting 
violence in favour of peaceful tactics as a means o f gaining political or social 
objectives” 5 
According to Gene Sharp, who is the acclaimed best known writer on nonviolent 
action, there are different types of nonviolence “N onresistance, Active 
reconciliation, Moral resistance, Selective Nonviol ence, Passive Resistance, 
Peaceful Resistance, Nonviolent Direction, Gandhian  Nonviolence (Satyagraha) , 
Nonviolent Revolution.” 6 
 
1.2. Some Terms Associated With Nonviolence 
There are several terms, which have been used inter changeably with 
nonviolence. The term nonviolence “did not come int o use until the twentieth 
century... There has been considerable growth in th e methods that we now call 
nonviolent” 7 Nonviolence has been around the world through the centuries 
though coloured by certain terms, like Pacifism and  Civil Disobedience. 
 
 1.2.1. Pacifism 
It is defined as “opposition to the practice of war .” 8 It is also “the doctrine that 
all violence is injustifyable.” 9 Pacifism opposes not only war between nations 
but also violent revolution and coercive violence. In the modern era, pacifism 
has more often been associated with groups working for political ends and 
dedicated to nonviolent methods of achieving them. It remains a belief that all Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 25 wars and all forms of violence are wrong. Pacifism therefore holds that war 
could be, and should be abolished. 
There is a central belief at the core of pacifism- a respect for a consequent 
repugnance towards killing and the evitability of v iolence. Dovishness or Dovism 
is an informal term used to describe people to the nonpredatory nature of the 
dove. It is a form for pacifism. The opposite posit ion is hawkishness or 
militarism. 
 
1.2.2. Civil Disobedience. 
This is the refusal to obey unjust laws or decrees.  The refusal takes the form of 
passive resistance. For Civil Disobedience to be va lid, it must be nonviolent. 
John Rawls defines Civil Disobedience as “A public,  nonviolent, conscientious, 
yet political act contrary to law usually done with  the aim of bringing about a 
change in the law with policies of government.” 10  
People practicing Civil Disobedience break a law be cause they consider the law 
unjust and want to call attention to its injustices , hoping to bring about its 
repeal or amendment. The people are also willing to  accept any penalty such as 
imprisonment for breaking the law. It means the ref usal to obey laws using 
nonviolent means to force concessions from governme nt. It is mostly taken by 
large number of people against government principle s. 
Civil Disobedience has brought about important chan ges in Law and government 
policies and those who undertake this disobedience do not break the law simply 
for personal gain. They work with the conviction th at “the society governs with 
laws and decrees promulgated by the ruling governme nt. Some of these laws 
may disregard the rights of individuals who may fee l aggrieved by such 
obnoxious laws” 11  Individuals who are so affected and moved by consc ience 
have the common good in mind and work with the dict um that “ lex injustas non 
est lex ”- “An unjust law is not law.”  
Civil disobedience makes a distinction between unju st laws, which only apply to 
a portion of the population, and a just law, which applies, to everyone.  Thus Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 26 Gandhi fought against laws in South Africa that onl y applied to Indians and 
Martin Luther King Jr. fought against racist laws t hat only applied to blacks. 
Despite this affirmation, we still affirm vehementl y that a law can apply to all 
and still be unjust.    
 
1.3. Historical Development of the Philosophy of No nviolence. 
The activities of great figures like Mahatma Gandhi  and Martin Luther King Jr., 
who used nonviolence, have stirred up the quest to trace the history of 
nonviolence. It is not however easy to have a compr ehensive history of the 
Philosophy of Nonviolence. This does not negate the  fact that nonviolence 
ideologies have been around the world for a very lo ng time. 
Gene Sharp dates back nonviolence ideology to c. 20 50 BC when King Bilalama 
formulated the Eshnunna law code. David McReynolds traces the History of no 
violence to an expression of the gospel or a varian t of the stoic philosophy of 
Marcus Aurelius. This history can be grouped thus; 
 
1.3.1. Nonviolence in Ancient Oriental Philosophy 
Ancient Oriental Philosophy (this phrase is no long er widely used since there is 
a world of difference between Chinese and Indian th ought) has furnished us 
with a good background of nonviolence. McReynolds a ttests that Buddhism is a 
“totally nonviolent philosophy, which despite hards hips and persecution spread 
throughout Asia, finally subduing the Mongols who h ad so savaged Europe and 
China.” 12  Buddhism like other religions is supposed to be a "totally nonviolent 
philosophy", this does not deny in any way some odd s: Sri Lanka was in the 
midst of a brutal civil war for over 30 years, and the Sinhalese elites who are 
Buddhist waged a brutal and violent war upon their equally brutal adversaries, 
the Tamil Tigers (Hindus).  In 700BC, Parshva taugh t nonviolence in India. 
Confucius also taught Humanistic Ethics. 
 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 27 1.3.2. Nonviolence in Ancient Western Philosophy 
Among the ancient philosophers, Socrates distinguis hed himself as a 
Nonviolence activist. Scanning through Plato’s Dial ogues, we read that Socrates 
had the qualities of a nonviolence activist. His Crito, Euthrypho, Apology, 
Phaedo, and other Plato’s Dialogues trace Socrates’ concept s of Justice, 
approaches to violence, attitude to the truth and L aw. These qualify Socrates 
as a nonviolence activist. 
The Socratic way of accepting imprisonment and deat h showed a great sign of 
Civil Disobedience. Socrates refused to condone wit h the evil of the Democratic 
regime in 406BC and the Oligarchy regime in 404BC. Socrates felt it was 
necessary to create a tension in the mind so that i ndividuals could rise from the 
bondage of Myths and half myths to the unaffected r ealm of creative analysis 
and objective appraisal. 
Scanning through the stoic philosophy of Marcus Aur elius, some traces of 
nonviolence can be deduced. The emperor when teachi ng compassion for 
infirmity said in his Meditations.   
When anyone does you a wrong, set yourself at once to consider 
what was the point of view, good or bad, that led h im wrong. As 
soon as you perceive it, you will be sorry for him,  not surprised or 
angry. For your own view of good is either the same  as his or 
something like in kind, and you will make allowance . Or supposing 
your own view of good and bad has altered, you will  find charity 
for his mistake comes easier. 13   
This attitude of Aurelius presents a basic principl e of nonviolence which Gandhi 
will later expand. That of seeing the good in the o ther person and treating the 
person with love. 
 
1.3.3. Early Christian/ Medieval Views 
Nonviolence and pacifist elements can be found amon g early Christians. The 
Christian gospel with such exhortations as “love th ine enemies” and “Blessed Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 28 are the peacemakers, they shall be called children of God” and other preaching 
portray nonviolence. Christians, using these, faile d to fight during the 
persecutions of Diocletian- showing a nonviolent sp irit. In the medieval era, 
‘the Anabaptists’ 14  formed a nonviolent church and a nonviolent Hutter ite.  
 
1.3.4. Nonviolence in the 17 th , 18 th  and 19 th  Century 
Within this period, there began a more noticeable i nstitutionalization of 
nonviolence in the form of religious organizations that survived to the present 
day. The Quakers in the 17 th  century fought a painful campaign against English 
law, forbidding dissenters to meet publicly.  Many of them died in the 
pestilential prisons. They provide one of the early  examples of a successful 
Nonviolence campaign. 
Between 1760 and 1775, America faced the nonviolent  phase of her revolution. 
By 1815, peace societies were founded. A prominent figure, David Henry, 
Thoreau wrote classical works on Civil disobedience  and suffered imprisonment. 
His masterpieces “Resistance to Civil Government” a nd “Essay on civil 
Disobedience” remained a sine qua non to any nonvio lent activist. .  Gandhi 
read it later, after forming his own model of Civil  Disobedience.  
 
1.3.5. Nonviolence in the 20 th  and 21 st  Century 
These centuries record a climax in nonviolence. Fro m 1893-1910, Tolstoy who 
influenced Gandhi a great deal wrote extensive abou t love and nonviolence. In 
1894, Gandhi helped Indians in South Africa to orga nize the Natal Indian 
Congress.   From 1901-1917, Russia faced some trace s of nonviolent resistance. 
Gandhi also carried out many campaigns to be explai ned in Chapter Two. By 
1918, Bertrand Russell was imprisoned for pacifist writing. Albert Einstein also 
took active part in Nonviolence. He was a great adm irer of Gandhi and 
exchanged letters with him. He advised people to re fuse military service. The 
period also witnessed the advent of A. J. Muste and  Martin Luther King Jr., Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 29 great nonviolence activists. Nonviolence movements grew around a number of 
religious organizations like the Catholic Worker, P ax Christi, etc.  
Women also in this period played great roles. Ira C hernus puts it thus; “Women 
have made huge contributions to the history of nonv iolence... throughout most 
of the history... women were actively organizing, s upporting and encouraging 
nonviolent movements and groups in all sorts of way s” 15  Prominent among the 
women were Dorothy Day and Barbara Deming. Back her e in Nigeria, the Aba 
Women’s riot of October 1929 is a good example of t he role of women in 
nonviolence. Ten thousand women rioted and the demo nstrations swept 
through the Owerri-Calabar districts. (The term rio t should not be understood 
in this case to mean ‘violent’, they exhibited nonv iolence characteristics.) Mrs. 
Margaret Ekpo has distinguished herself as the doye n of women emancipation. 
She fought nonviolently for the rights of women in Nigeria.  We can also 
mention the WOZA or Women of Zimbabwe Arise. It is a civic movement in 
Zimbabwe which was formed in 2002 by Jenni Williams . Here are the objectives 
of the group: 
• Provide women, from all walks of life, with a uni ted voice to speak out 
on issues affecting their day-to-day lives. 
• Empower female leadership that will lead communit y involvement in 
pressing for solutions to the current crisis. 
• Encourage women to stand up for their rights and freedoms. 
They also Lobby and advocate on those issues affect ing women and their 
families. WOZA is supported by Amnesty Internationa l. This group is a Ndebele 
word meaning ‘Come forward’. They have so far recei ved many awards. In 
2008, WOZA was awarded the Amnesty International Me nschenrechtspreis 
(human rights award) of 2008 by the German chapter of Amnesty International. 
On November 23, 2009, prominent WOZA member Magodon ga Mahlangu and 
founder Jenni Williams received the Robert F. Kenne dy Human Rights Award. 
The award was presented by US president Barack Obam a. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 30 In many countries around the world, we now hear of peaceful demonstrations, 
peaceful protest and boycotts. These are all forms of nonviolence action. One 
of the most recent accounts of nonviolence can be f ound at the protest by 
some people in the recent Iraqi-USA war.    
 
1.4. The Basic Characteristics and Rules of Nonviol ence  
Many definitions have been proffered to make the ph ilosophy of Nonviolence 
well understood. The history has served to give hig hlights of how nonviolence 
has been used consciously or unconsciously. We shal l now look at the basis of 
nonviolent action generally and examine the basic r ules of a nonviolent activist. 
 
1.4.1. Nonviolent Action 
Nonviolent action according to Gene Sharp is  
A technique by which people who reject passivity an d submission, 
and who see struggle as essential can wage their co nflict without 
violence. Nonviolent action is not an attempt to av oid or ignore 
conflict. It is one response to the problem of how to act 
effectively in politics especially how to wield pow er effectively. 16  
When Sharp talks of “Conflict without Violence”, it  should not be concluded 
that anything without violence is nonviolence. It r emains an undeniable fact 
that the first basic characteristic of nonviolence is the eradication of violence. 
This is because 
In an age when threat to violence is as common as t he air we 
breathe, the prospect of an alternative keeps reced ing into the 
archives of by-gone history. In such an age, opting  for nonviolence 
may be considered to be not only foolish and scanda lous, but 
untimely suicidal. 17  
Again one must understand that nonviolence does not  just mean “no violence”. 
This is elaborately described by Bob Irwin and Gord on Faison that:  Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 31  Nonviolent action is not simply any method of acti on which is not 
violent. Broadly speaking, it means taking action t hat goes beyond 
normal institutionalized, political methods (voting , lobbying, letter 
writing, verbal expressions) without injuring oppon ents. It requires 
a willingness to take risks and bear suffering with out retaliation. 18  
In accepting suffering, we can reach the religious stage of Kierkegaard, which 
has its focal point simply in suffering. This helps  us put an emphasis on active 
love 
There are generally three main acts of nonviolent a ction. 
1 Nonviolent protest and persuasion.  This is a class of methods, which 
are mainly symbolic acts of peaceful opposition or of attempted 
persuasion, extending beyond verbal expressions. Th ese methods 
include marches, vigils, pickets, the use of poster s, street theatre, 
painting, and protest meetings. 
2 Noncooperation.  This is the most common form of nonviolent action 
and involves deliberate withdrawal of cooperation w ith the person, 
activity, institution or regime with which the acti vists have become 
engaged in conflict. Political noncooperation inclu des acts of civil 
disobedience,- the deliberate, open and peaceful vi olation of 
particular laws, decrees, regulations and the like,  which are believed  
to be  illegitimate for some  reasons. Those who un dertake this are 
faced with this question; must the law be obeyed? T hese feel that law 
portrays a great deal of normative personalism, in other words, if a 
law is unjust, it should not be obeyed. Noncooperat ion is an 
effective, noble and valuable means to bring change . Ravindra Kumar 
insists that this has been used by great men to end  atrocities, 
inhumanities and injustices. It has been used to fi ght against 
wrongdoers, tyrants, oppressors, exploiters and unj ust persons. One 
reads the following line from Kumar: “some ancient times great men, 
leaders of societies, philosophers and reformers ha ve taken the path 
of non-cooperation to remove obstacles from the way  of mutual Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 32 cooperation. For them, it has been a method of stre ngthening the 
process of cooperation”19 . These great men, before proposing it to 
the world, tried it themselves and discovered its s trength in according 
justice and freedom. 
3 Nonviolent Intervention, which is the active insertion and disruptive 
presence of people in the usual processes of social  institutions. It 
includes sit-ins, occupations, and obstructions of business as usual, in 
offices, the streets and elsewhere. This method pos es a direct and 
immediate challenge than the others. 
There are many other characteristics of nonviolent action outlined by Gene 
Sharp, but these ones outlined satisfy our needs. 
 
1.4.2. Rules Guiding a Nonviolent Person 
There are some basic rules, which a person must pos sess to carry out a 
successful nonviolence campaign. These are; 
1 The person using nonviolence will seek to be absolu tely open, honest 
ad truthful. 
2 The person using nonviolence will seek to overcome fear so as to act 
not out of weakness but from strength. 
3 The person using nonviolence will never defame the character of the 
opponent, but always seek to find what the Quakers call “That of 
God” in those whom we struggle. 
4 We shall do our best to love those with whom we are  in conflict. 
Many feel that ‘noninvolvement’ is a basic characte ristic of nonviolence. 
Contrary to this, ‘noninvolvement’ means living in the aesthetic level of 
existence where one is strictly an observer- a non participant and the whole 
life is one of the cynical noninvolvement. He who p ossesses nonviolence has 
made a choice of life. This is eminent in Mahatma G andhi’s Philosophy of 
nonviolence. Africa Needs Gandhi

2.0. GANDHI’S PHILOSOPHY OF NONVIOLENCE 
With Gandhi, the notion of nonviolence attained a s pecial status. He not only 
theorized   on it, he adopted nonviolence as a phil osophy and an ideal way of 
life. He made us understand that the philosophy of nonviolence is not a weapon 
of the weak; it is a weapon, which can be tried by all. 
Nonviolence was not Gandhi’s invention. He is howev er called the father of 
nonviolence because according to Mark Shepard, “He raised nonviolent action 
to a level never before achieved.”  1 Krishna Kripalani again asserts “Gandhi was 
the first in Human history to extend the principle of nonviolence from the 
individual to social and political plane.”  2 While scholars were talking about an 
idea without a name or a movement, Gandhi is the pe rson who came up with 
the name and brought together different related ide as under one concept: 
Satyagraha. 
 
2.1. Gandhi’s View of Violence/Nonviolence. 
Gandhi saw violence pejoratively and also identifie d two forms of violence; 
Passive and Physical, as we saw earlier. The practi ce of passive violence is a 
daily affair, consciously and unconsciously. It is again the fuel that ignites the 
fire of physical violence.  Gandhi understands violence from its Sanskrit root,  
“himsa”, meaning injury. In the midst of hyper violence, Gan dhi teaches that 
the one who possess nonviolence is blessed. 
Blessed is the man who can perceive the law of ahimsa 
(nonviolence)  in the midst of the raging fire of himsa  all around 
him. We bow in reverence to such a man by his examp le. The more 
adverse the circumstances around him, the intenser grows his 
longing for deliverance from the bondage of flesh w hich is a 
vehicle of himsa …3 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 36 Gandhi objects to violence because it perpetuates h atred. When it appears to 
do ‘good’, the good is only temporary and cannot do  any good in the long run. A 
true nonviolence activist accepts violence on himse lf without inflicting it on 
another. This is heroism, and will be discussed in another section. When Gandhi 
says that in the course of fighting for human right s, one should accept violence 
and self-suffering, he does not applaud cowardice. Cowardice for him is “the 
greatest violence, certainly, far greater   than bl oodshed and the like that 
generally go under the name of violence.”  4 
For Gandhi, perpetrators of violence (whom he refer red to as criminals), are 
products of social disintegration.  Gandhi feels th at violence is not a natural 
tendency of humans. It is a learned experience. The re is need for a perfect 
weapon to combat violence and this is nonviolence. 
Gandhi understood nonviolence from its Sanskrit roo t “Ahimsa”.  Ahimsa is just 
translated to mean nonviolence in English, but it i mplies more than just 
avoidance of physical violence. Ahimsa implies tota l nonviolence, no physical 
violence, and no passive violence. Gandhi translate s Ahimsa as love. This is 
explained by Arun Gandhi in an interview thus; “He (Gandhi) said ahimsa means 
love. Because if you have love towards somebody, an d you respect that person, 
then you are not going to do any harm to that perso n.”  5   For Gandhi, 
nonviolence is the greatest force at the disposal o f mankind. It is mightier than 
any weapon of mass destruction. It is superior to b rute force. It is a living force 
of power and no one has been or will ever be able t o measure its limits or it’s 
extend. 
Gandhi’s nonviolence is the search for truth. Truth  is the most fundamental 
aspect in Gandhi’s Philosophy of nonviolence. His w hole life has been 
“experiments of truth”. It was in this course of hi s pursuit of truth that Gandhi 
discovered nonviolence, which he further explained in his Autobiography thus 
“Ahimsa is the basis of the search for truth. I am realizing that this search is 
vain, unless it is founded on ahimsa as the basis.” 6 Truth and nonviolence are 
as old as the hills. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 37 For nonviolence to be strong and effective, it must  begin with the mind, 
without which it will be nonviolence of the weak an d cowardly.  A coward is a 
person who lacks courage when facing a dangerous an d unpleasant situation 
and tries to avoid it. A man cannot practice ahimsa  and at the same time be a 
coward. True nonviolence is dissociated from fear.  Gandhi feels that 
possession of arms is not only cowardice but also l ack of fearlessness or 
courage. Gandhi stressed this when he says; “I can imagine a fully armed man 
to be at heart a coward. Possession of arms implies  an element of fear, if not 
cowardice but true nonviolence is impossibility wit hout the possession of 
unadulterated fearlessness.”  7 In the face of violence and injustice, Gandhi 
considers violent resistance preferable to cowardly  submission. There is hope 
that a violent man may someday be nonviolent, but t here is no room for a 
coward to develop fearlessness.  
As the world’s pioneer in nonviolent theory and pra ctice, Gandhi unequivocally 
stated that nonviolence contained a universal appli cability. In his letter to 
Daniel Oliver in Hammana Lebanon on the 11 th  of 1937 Gandhi used these 
words: “ I have no message to give except this that  there is no deliverance for 
any people on this earth or for all the people of t his earth except through truth 
and nonviolence in every walk of life without any e xceptions.” 8 In this passage, 
Gandhi promises “deliverance” through nonviolence f or oppressed peoples 
without exception. Speaking primarily with regards to nonviolence as a 
libratory philosophy in this passage, Gandhi emphas izes the power of 
nonviolence to emancipate spiritually and physicall y. It is a science and of its 
own can lead one to pure democracy. 
 
2.2. Satyagraha, the Centre of Gandhi’s Contributio n to the Philosophy of 
Nonviolence. 
It will be good here to examine what Stanley E. Jon es calls “the centre of 
Gandhi’s contribution to the world”. All else is ma rginal compared to it. 
Satyagraha is the quintessence of Gandhism. Through  it, Gandhi introduced a Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 38 new spirit to the world. It is the greatest of all Gandhi’s contribution to the 
world. 
 
2.2.1. What is Satyagraha? 
Satyagraha (pronounced sat-YAH-graha) is a compound  of two Sanskrit nouns 
satya, meaning truth (from ‘sat’- ‘being’ with a suffix ‘y a’), and agraha,  
meaning, “firm grasping” (a noun made from the agra , which has its root 
‘grah’ - ‘seize’, ‘grasp’, with the verbal prefix ‘a’ – ‘t o’ ‘towards). Thus 
Satyagraha literally means devotion to truth, remai ning firm on the truth and 
resisting untruth actively but nonviolently. Since the only way for Gandhi 
getting to the truth is by nonviolence (love), it f ollows that Satyagraha implies 
an unwavering search for the truth using nonviolenc e. Satyagraha according to 
Michael Nagler literally means ‘clinging to truth,’  and that was exactly how 
Gandhi understood it: “clinging to the truth that w e are all one under the skin, 
that there is no such thing as a ‘win/lose’ confron tation because all our 
important interests are really the same, that consc iously or not every single 
person wants unity and peace with every other”9  Put succinctly, Satyagraha 
means ‘truth force’ , ‘soul force’ or as Martin Lut her Jr would call it ‘love in 
action.’ Satyagraha has often been defined as the p hilosophy of nonviolent 
resistance most famously employed by Mahatma Gandhi , in forcing an end to 
the British domination. Gene Sharp did not hesitate  to define Satyagraha simply 
as “Gandhian Nonviolence.”  10 
Today as Nagler would say, when we use the word Sat yagraha we sometimes 
mean that general principle, the fact that love is stronger than hate (and we 
can learn to use it to overcome hate), and sometime s we mean more 
specifically active resistance by a repressed group ; sometimes, even more 
specifically, we apply the term to a given movement  like Salt Satyagraha etc. It 
is worthwhile looking at the way Gandhi uses Satyag raha. 
 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 39 2.2.2. Gandhi View of Satyagraha 
Satyagraha was not a preconceived plan for Gandhi. Event in his life 
culminating in his “Bramacharya vow”,  11 prepared him for it. He therefore 
underlined: 
Events were so shaping themselves in Johannesburg a s to make this 
self-purification on my part a preliminary as it we re to Satyagraha. 
I can now see that all the principal events of my l ife, culminating 
in the vow of Bramacharya were secretly preparing m e for it. 12 
Satyagraha is a moral weapon and the stress is on s oul force over physical 
force. It aims at winning the enemy through love an d patient suffering. It aims 
at winning over an unjust law, not at crushing, pun ishing, or taking revenge 
against the authority, but to convert and heal it. Though it started as a struggle 
for political rights, Satyagraha became in the long  run a struggle for individual 
salvation, which could be achieved through love and  self-sacrifice. Satyagraha 
is meant to overcome all methods of violence. Gandh i explained in a letter to 
Lord Hunter that Satyagraha is a movement based ent irely upon truth. It 
replaces every form of violence, direct and indirec t, veiled and unveiled and 
whether in thought, word or deed. 
Satyagraha is for the strong in spirit. A doubter o r a timid person cannot do it. 
Satyagraha teaches the art of living well as well a s dying. It is love and 
unshakeable firmness that comes from it. Its traini ng is meant for all, 
irrespective of age and sex. The most important tra ining is mental not physical. 
It has some basic precepts treated below. 
 
2.2.3. The Basic Precepts of Satyagraha 
There are three basic precepts essential to Satyagr aha: Truth, Nonviolence and 
self-suffering. These are called the pillars of Sat yagraha. Failure to grasp them 
is a handicap to the understanding of Gandhi’s non –violence. These three 
fundamentals correspond to Sanskrit terms:  
- Sat/Satya  – Truth implying openness, honesty and fairness Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 40 - Ahimsa /Nonviolence – refusal to inflict injury upon other s. 
- Tapasya  – willingness to self-sacrifice. 
These fundamental concepts are elaborated below. 
1. Satya/Truth:  Satyagraha as stated before literally means truth force. 
Truth is relative. Man is not capable of knowing th e absolute truth. Satyagraha 
implies working steadily towards a discovery of the  absolute truth and 
converting the opponent into a trend in the working  process. What a person 
sees as truth may just as clearly be untrue for ano ther. Gandhi made his life a 
numerous experiments with truth. In holding to the truth, he claims to be 
making a ceaseless effort to find it. 
Gandhi’s conception of truth is deeply rooted in Hi nduism. The emphasis of 
Satya-truth is paramount in the writings of the Ind ian philosophers. 
“Satyannasti Parodharmati (Satyan Nasti Paro Dharma Ti) – there is no religion 
or duty greater than truth”, holds a prominent plac e in Hinduism. Reaching 
pure and absolute truth is attaining moksha. Gandhi  holds that truth is God, 
and maintains that it is an integral part of Satyag raha. He explains it thus:  
The world rests upon the bedrock of satya or truth;  asatya 
meaning untruth also means “nonexistent” and satya or truth, 
means that which is of untruth does not so much exi st. Its victory 
is out of the question. And truth being “that which  is” can never 
be destroyed. This is the doctrine of Satyagraha in  a nutshell. 13 
2. Ahimsa: In Gandhi’s Satyagraha, truth is inseparable from A himsa. 
Ahimsa expresses as ancient Hindu, Jain and Buddhis t ethical precept. The 
negative prefix ‘a’ plus himsa meaning injury make up the world normally 
translated ‘nonviolence’. The term Ahimsa appears i n Hindu teachings as early 
as the Chandoya Upanishad. The Jain Religion consti tutes Ahimsa as the first 
vow. It is a cardinal virtue in Buddhism. Despite i ts being rooted in these 
Religions, the special contribution of Gandhi was:  
To make the concept of Ahimsa meaningful in the soc ial and 
political spheres by moulding tools for nonviolent action to use as Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 41 a positive force in the search for social and polit ical truths. Gandhi 
formed Ahimsa into the active social technique, whi ch was to 
challenge political authorities and religious ortho doxy. 14  
It is worth noting that this ‘active social techniq ue which was to challenge 
political authorities’, used by Gandhi is none othe r than Satyagraha. Truly 
enough, the Indian milieu was already infused with notions of Ahimsa. 
Nevertheless, Gandhi acknowledged that it was an es sential part of his 
experiments with the truth whose technique of actio n he called Satyagraha.  
 At the root of Satya and Ahimsa is love.  While ma king discourses on the 
Bhagavad-Gita, an author says: 
Truth, peace, righteousness and nonviolence, Satya, Shanti, 
Dharma  and Ahimsa,  do not exist separately. They are all 
essentially dependent on love. When love enters the  thoughts it 
becomes truth. When it manifests itself in the form  of action it 
becomes truth. When Love manifests itself in the fo rm of action it 
becomes Dharma  or righteousness. When your feelings become 
saturated with love you become peace itself. The ve ry meaning of 
the word peace is love. When you fill your understa nding with love 
it is Ahimsa . Practicing love is Dharma , thinking of love is Satya,  
feeling love is Shanti,  and understanding love is Ahimsa . For all 
these values it is love which flows as the undercur rent. 15 
3. Tapasya (Self-Suffering); it remains a truism that the classical yogic laws 
of self-restraint and self-discipline are familiar elements in Indian culture. Self-
suffering in Satyagraha is a test of love. It is de tected first of all towards the 
much persuasion of one whom is undertaken. Gandhi d istinguished self-
suffering from cowardice. Gandhi’s choice of self-s uffering does not mean that 
he valued life low. It is rather a sign of voluntar y help and it is noble and 
morally enriching. He himself says; 
It is not because I value life low that I can count enance with joy 
Thousands voluntary losing their lives for Satyagra ha, but because I 
know that it results in the long run in the least l oss of life, and Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 42 what is more, it ennobles those who lose their live s and morally 
enriches the world for their sacrifice. 16 
Satyagraha is at its best when preached and practic ed by those who would use 
arms but decided instead to invite suffering upon t hem. 
It is not easy for a western mind or nonoriental ph ilosopher to understand this 
issue of self-suffering. In fact, in Satyagraha, th e element of self-suffering is 
perhaps the least acceptable to a western mind. Yet  such sacrifice may well 
provide the ultimate means of realizing that charac teristic so eminent in 
Christian religion and western moral philosophy: Th e dignity of the individual. 
The three elements: Satya, Ahimsa, Tapasya must mov e together for the 
success of any Satyagraha campaign. It follows that  Ahimsa – which implies 
love, leads in turn to social service. Truth leads to an ethical humanism. Self-
suffering not for its own sake, but for the demonst ration of sincerity flowing 
from refusal to injure the opponent while at the sa me time holding to the 
truth, implies sacrifice and preparation for sacrif ice even to death.  
 
2.3. Satyagraha in Action 
For Satyagraha to be valid, it has to be tested. Wh en the principles are applied 
to specific political and social action, the tools of civil disobedience, 
noncooperation, nonviolent strike, and constructive  action are cherished. South 
Africa and India were ‘laboratories’ where Gandhi t ested his new technique. 
Satyagraha was a necessary weapon for Gandhi to wor k in South Africa and 
India. Louis Fischer attests that: “Gandhi could ne ver have achieved what he 
did in South Africa and India but for a weapon pecu liarly his own. It was 
unprecedented indeed; it was so unique he could not  find a name for it until he 
finally hit upon Satyagraha.” 17 
South Africa is the acclaimed birthplace of Satyagr aha. Here Satyagraha was 
employed to fight for the civil rights of Indians i n South Africa. In India, Gandhi 
applied Satyagraha in his socio-political milieu an d carried out several acts of 
civil disobedience culminating in the Salt March. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 43 Another wonderful way of seeing Satyagraha in actio n is through the fasting of 
Mahatma Gandhi. Fasting was part and parcel of his philosophy of truth and 
nonviolence. Mahatma Gandhi was an activist – a mor al and spiritual activist. 
And fasting was “one of his strategies of activism,  in many ways his most 
powerful.”  18 
 
2.3.1. Qualities of a Satyagrahi (Nonviolence Activ ist) 
Gandhi was quite aware that there was need to train  people who could carry on 
with his Satyagraha campaigns. He trained them in h is “Satyagraha Ashrams”. 
Here are some of the basic qualities of expected of  a Satyagrahi.  
1 A Satyagraha should have a living faith in God for he is his only Rock. 
2 One must believe in truth and nonviolence as one’s creed and therefore 
have faith in the inherent goodness of human nature . 
3 One must live a chaste life and be ready and willin g for the sake of one’s 
cause to give up his life and his possessions. 
4 One must be free from the use any intoxicant, in or der that his reason 
may be undivided and his mind constant. 
5 One must carry out with a willing heart all the rul es of discipline as may 
be laid down from time to time. 
6 One should carry out the jail rules unless they are  especially dense to 
hurt his self-respect. 
7 A satyagrahi must accept to suffer in order to corr ect a situation. 
In a nutshell, Satyagraha is itself a movement inte nded to fight social and 
promote ethical values. It is a whole philosophy of  nonviolence. It is undertaken 
only after all the other peaceful means have proven  ineffective. At its heart is 
nonviolence. An attempt is made to convert, persuad e or win over the 
opponent. It involves applying the forces of both r eason and conscience 
simultaneously, while holding aloft the indisputabl e truth of his/her position. 
The Satyagrahi also engages in acts of voluntary su ffering. Any violence Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 44 inflicted by the opponent is accepted without retal iation. The opponent can 
only become morally bankrupt if violence continues to be inflicted indefinitely. 
Several methods can be applied in a Satyagraha camp aign. Stephen Murphy 
gives primacy to “noncooperation and fasting”. Bert rand Russell has this to say 
about Gandhi’s method: 
The essence of this method which he (Gandhi) gradua lly brought to 
greater and greater perfection consisted in refusal  to do things, 
which the authorities wished to have done, while ab staining from 
any positive action of an aggressive sort…. The met hod always had 
in Gandhi’s mind a religious aspect… As a rule, thi s method 
depended upon moral force for its success. 19 
Murphy and Russell do not accept Gandhi’s doctrine totally. Michael 
Nagler insists that they ignore Constructive Progra mme, which Gandhi 
considered paramount. A better understanding of Gan dhi’s nonviolence 
will be seen in the next chapter.

3.0. INTERPRETATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING OF GANDHI’s PHILOSOPHY OF 
NONVIOLENCE 
 
Gandhi, through Satyagraha, has provided the world with a universal and 
timeless philosophy. Like Socrates, Gandhi was like  a gadfly and was often an 
embarrassment and an irritant even to his friends a nd allies. He challenged 
mostly power positions that pretended to be based o n sound knowledge and 
morality. Like Kant, he focused much of his attenti on to motives and 
intentions, but moved a step further to emphasize t he primacy of morality. He 
therefore had little sympathy for detached theories  of knowledge that are not 
grounded in morality or for theology and metaphysic s which pretend to 
transcend morality. 
Gandhi emphasized an integral relationship between means and ends. One 
cannot use impure or immoral means to achieve worth y goals. Gandhi departs 
from the Utilitarians as Sisir Sanyal attests: 
The utilitarian philosophers in the west enunciated  the concept of 
greatest good of the greatest number as the aim of state policy. 
This has failed to take a holistic view of the enti re human race and 
ignored man; that is to say each and every man, as the prime 
concern of the state…. As against this, Gandhi prop ounded the 
theory of sarvodaya , which means the rise of all that too in the 
fullest measure each man is capable of. 1 
In order to understand this ‘timeless philosophy’ p ropounded by Gandhi, it will 
be good to see the various interpretations given to  it. After this, the basic 
principles of nonviolence at public and private lev els will be exposed. This 
chapter will end with an understanding of Gandhi’s dialectics and political 
theory, deduced from his philosophy of nonviolence.

www.mkgandhi.org Page 47 3.1. The Etic and Emic Interpretations of Gandhian Satyagraha 
Satyagraha has not been understood by all, especial ly those alien to the 
oriental traditions. As a result, there have emerge d two different views of 
Satyagraha viz. the Emic  and Etic  views. When the perspective stems from 
common culture and history, it may be termed  Emic.  This contrasts to the 
perspective of an outsider to a culture, which can be termed Etic.  The Emic 
view of Satyagraha is seldom evident to an untraine d outsider because, while 
insensitive to the nuances of a given culture, it i nvites generalizations and 
comparisons. Differences in context might require d ifferences of expression of 
Satyagraha. Events generally have different meaning s with respect to the actor 
and viewer. The way things are done by a particular  set of people may not be 
interpreted same as when viewed by outsiders not ha ving the same history and 
culture. 
 These views have been well explained and used by W illiam J. Starosta and 
Angu G. Chaudhery in their article “I can wait 40 o r 400 years: Gandhian 
Satyagraha East and West.” 2 Satyagraha in the West is seen as Etic while in th e 
east it is seen as Emic. This is because Satyagraha  has much in common with 
Eastern Traditions and Philosophy. We don’t negate in any way that there might 
be a substantial tradition of Satyagraha, called by  whatever names, in the 
West.  
 
3.1.1. Etic Interpretation:  Satyagraha in the West  
To understand Gandhi’s Satyagraha in the West, most  students turn to a 
familiar American Landmark. In the west, Gandhi’s S atyagraha has been 
understood in terms of Henry David Thoreau’s ‘Civil  Disobedience’, though 
some others move a little further than Thoreau. The  Salt March is often 
described ambiguously as Civil Disobedience. At tim es even Gandhi himself 
referred to the Salt March as civil disobedience wh en he attests that “you have 
given me a teacher in Thoreau who furnished me thro ugh his essay on ‘the Duty Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 48 of Civil Disobedience. Scientific confirmation of w hat I was doing in South 
Africa” 3 
Gandhi differentiated his Satyagraha from Civil Dis obedience. Civil 
Disobedience is at most a branch of Satyagraha. For  him, “Satyagraha is like a 
Banyan tree with innumerable branches. Civil Disobe dience is one such branch. 
Satya ( truth) and ahimsa ( Nonviolence) together make the present trunk from 
which innumerable branches shoot out.” 4 
Krishna Shridharani’s book on “War Without Violence”  has been quoted by 
Gene Sharp to show us 13 techniques most characteri stic of Satyagraha. Of 
these, Civil disobedience is the 11 th  technique. The Etic interpretation seems 
too reductionist. The Emic interpretation will give  a better understanding of 
Gandhian Satyagraha. 
 
3.1.2. Emic Interpretation: Satyagraha in the East 
Gandhi and Satyagraha are viewed here as continuous  with three millennia old 
traditions of Indian tradition and practice. In oth er words Gandhi’s Satyagraha 
is deeply rooted in the Indian traditions. There ar e seven Emic aspects of 
Gandhian Satyagraha.  
1) Nonduality : since the Post-Vendantic, Indian philosophic religion had 
evolved in the direction of philosophic monism. Thi s implies no distinctions 
between self and absolute, thought and action, mean s and ends. While western 
philosophy sees distinction between “means and ends ” 5, Gandhi does not 
distinguish between them. To achieve good ends, one  could use none other 
than good means. Violence begets Violence, Nonviole nce begets Nonviolence. 
2) Purification : In order to fetch Good out of Evil via Satyagraha  constitutes 
a total effort of heart, mind, and body. There is c onstant need in the Hindu 
culture for purification. Purification can be done through renunciation of 
worldly things.  The Indian term for this is Bramacharya (Celibacy, Chastity).  
Gandhi himself took the Bramachyrya vow and recommended it to the 
Satyagrahi.  Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 49 3) Sacrifice : the earliest forms of Hinduism stressed ‘ vrata’ and ‘tapas’ 6 
and properly would produce results in defiance of t he gods themselves. The 
power of sacrifice was highly recommended by Gandhi . The Satyagrahi like 
Gandhi is asked to sacrifice life, family, things o n earth, self-importance, and 
to court suffering in the belief that unearned suff ering is redemptive. Gandhi 
was optimistic that just as Vedic sacrifice could d efy the gods, so too self-
sacrifice could defy British authorities 
4) Inevitability : Gandhi was never daunted by length of time. “How long 
will a desired end take to be effected by means of Satyagraha?  The result was 
inevitable; Gandhi never doubted” 7. The stress in Hinduism upon samsara- a 
belief in repeated rebirths for so long as the pers on is lacking in perfection or 
understanding ( samsara means ‘world cycle’). One object is to transcend 
rebirth through disciplined action. This places Sat yagraha into a mythic time 
frame, wherein laws of sacrifice will work themselv es out in however long the 
process must take. A quick result might be politica lly desirable, but a 
religiously inevitable result would certainly be as sured if not this time, then in 
the next. 
5) Conversion : Satyagraha aims at converting the opponent. Evil is present 
in many forms within the world. In its mildest form , evil could represent error 
in a friend while in another case; it could represe nt evil in an opponent. The 
remedy for any degree of evil in the emic view was conversion through self-
effacement. For example, if a follower of Satyagrah a decides to put on a 
foreign dress instead of home spurn clothes, a Saty agrahi would be assigned to 
meet the offender on one’s knees and humbly implore  the person to correct the 
error. Satyagraha aims at fighting the person’s dee d and not the person. 
General Jan Smut was a target for conversion by mea ns of Gandhian 
Satyagraha.  
6) Nonmanipulation : The very fact that Satyagraha in publicly permitt ing 
evil to act upon a transparently defenseless target  is the expectation that such 
evil would destroy itself through conversion to Goo d in Nonmanipulation. 
Manipulation is another form of force. Nonmanipulat ion sets up a scene in Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 50 which an actor risks characterization as evil becau se his acts become visible 
and morally accountable. In such a scene, only mora lly acceptable acts are 
likely to be performed.  One writer refers to this force as “one of purification 
rather than of manipulation.” 8 
7) Being versus Doing : Satyagraha grew as a philosophy within a context 
that stressed being, contemplation, asceticism, and  intrinsic goodness of 
character as preferred social ends. Civil disobedie nce grew in a culture which 
favoured doing over being. Contrary to a Western vi ew, which would like to 
respond to act with act, anger with anger, deed wit h deed, a satagrahi is 
trained to thank the jail keeper for performing the  arrest, to congratulate 
those who were imprisoned. By this preference for b eing over doing, the 
conflict was joined between spiritual truth and cor rupt deeds not directly 
between antagonists.  
In a nutshell it is good to understand Satyagraha w ithin the cultural background 
form, which it evolved. It should be noted that the  etic accounts saw the 
British as enemies and not friends. However, if und erstood with an emic view, 
Satyagraha will be seen as a public expression of p ure thought, thought that is 
one with action; which is performed as a moral duty  with no dread of 
consequence. “Such detached witness as sacrifice le ading immutably and 
inexorably to conversion of evil to good”, Starosta  and Chaudhery attest “if not 
now, then sometime later.” 9 
Gandhian Satyagraha for an emic culture resulted in  the rendering of Gandhian 
techniques as syncretic. This is because the impact  of the west, with etic views 
upon the several traditions of India bears traces o f the thought and experience 
of modern Europe. The transplanting of social and p olitical philosophies current 
in the west to the rich cultural soil of the Indian  sub-continent has resulted in a 
growth both vigorous and productive. The impact of this syncretism Bondurant 
attests, has been “more tellingly demonstrated…in t he development of the 
Gandhian technique.” 10

www.mkgandhi.org Page 51 3.2. Essential Principles of Gandhi’s Philosophy of  Nonviolence 
A more Emic understanding of Gandhi’s Philosophy of  Nonviolence will reveal 
some essential principles both at the public and pr ivate level. The principles of 
Gandhi’s Philosophy at the public level include; Tr uth, Ahimsa, Trusteeship and 
Constructive Action/Programme. While at private lev el we have; Respect, 
Understanding, Appreciation and acceptance. 
 
3.2.1. Gandhi’s Philosophy of Nonviolence at Public  level 
The Essential principles at public level are: - 
1) Truth:   The imperfect translation of the Sanskrit satya. The meaning of 
truth is, of course obvious. It must be noted that truth has many sides and is 
ever changing. What appears true today may not be t rue tomorrow, or what 
appears true to us may not be same for others. We m ust develop the ability to 
look at everything from different perspectives. How ever, we have to aim at the 
absolute truth, which Gandhi identifies with God. A iming at this absolute truth 
implies numerous experiments with the truth, which Gandhi applied at public 
level. 
2) Ahimsa:  This is nonviolence in thought, word and deed. Far  from 
meaning mere peacefulness or the absence of overt v iolence, Gandhi 
understood it to denote active love. It is used at public level to bring about 
positive changes. We should therefore aim at an A+ grade in our perception of 
nonviolence. 
3) Trusteeship: For Gandhi,  violence is inherent in our present economic, 
social and industrial systems.  He therefore aims a t bringing a change through 
the application of his concept of Trusteeship. Trus teeship according to Bader 
means “Having faith and confidence in a process of taking responsibility for 
assets and social values and administering their ri ghtful and creative usage for 
benefit of others now and in the coming ages.” 11  Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 52 Its objective is to create nonviolent and nonexploi tative relationships. Gandhi 
believes that the concepts of possession and privat e property were sources of 
violence. All wealth belongs to all people. He reco gnizes that the concept of 
ownership cannot wither easily and that the rich ca nnot be easily persuaded to 
share their wealth. He therefore invites those peop le who consider themselves 
today as owners to act as trustees; that is, owners , not in their own right, but 
owners in the right of those whom they have exploit ed. This principle seeks to 
destroy not the capitalists, but capitalism. Truste eship provides a means of 
attaining an egalitarian society. The basis of this  socialism is economic 
equality. 
Trusteeship is strongly based on participatory demo cracy. It is a “fraternal 
partnership between all factors of production with the aim of achieving larger 
social benefit rather that working toward a narrow economic objective such as 
profit.” 12  Trusteeship is the natural corollary to constructi ve action / 
programme. 
4) Constructive Programme: Gandhi devoted himself to the social, economic 
and spiritual regeneration of the country and felt this would be achieved by the 
efforts of the people themselves. Gandhi therefore emphasized on what he had 
originally conceived as “spiritual socialism”, the positive counterpart of 
noncooperation and civil disobedience and eventuall y called the constructive 
program. 
To win independence , Gandhi felt the only truthful and nonviolent way wo uld 
be through the constructive action. Gandhi therefor e feels that the 
constructive programme may more otherwise and more fittingly be called 
“Construction of Poorna  Swaraj  or complete independence by the truthful and 
nonviolent means.” 13  It means getting involved in finding constructive solutions 
to problems. We usually ward our responsibilities o n someone else’s shoulders, 
usually government’s shoulders. Yet they have serio us consequences. 
The constructive programme was the greatest means t o economic development 
for a poor country like India. Mahatma Gandhi feels  strongly that the 
constructive programme is another form of Satyagrah a, which could bring about Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 53 a nonviolent agrarian revolution. The following are  the various constructive 
programmes listed by Gandhi: 
Unity of religious communities, Removal of untoucha bility, Prohibition, Khadi, 
Other Village Industries, Village Sanitation, News of Basic Sanitation, Adult 
Education, Upliftment of Women, Education in health  Hygiene, Provincial 
Languages, Propagation of Rastra Basha (National La nguage), Promotion of 
Economic Equality, Kisans (peasants), Labour, Adiva sis, Lepers, Students. The 
Constructive Programme gave “Content to the Satyagr aha framework and 
applied Gandhian principles in the Indian conscienc e.” 14 
 
3.2.2. Gandhi’s Philosophy of Nonviolence at the Pr ivate Level 
According to Hector Ayala, true Gandhian peace has to come “through the 
proper understanding and practice of nonviolence ba sed on the four principles 
of nonviolence at personal level which includes res pect, understanding 
acceptance and appreciation”.  15  If we learn to build good relationships based 
on the four cardinal principles, then conflict will  be minimized. They all go to 
make the world more peaceful. 
The essential principles here include: 
1) Respect:  This is a behaviour and attitude, which reflect one ’s ability to 
see the worth and value in people, situations and i nstitutions. When there is no 
respect between people, conflict arises and leads t o violence. Gandhi therefore 
advocated fearlessly for the dignity of the human p erson. Gandhian 
Nonviolence teaches us to respect ourselves and oth ers and all of creation if 
this respect is cultivated at personal level, we wi ll be open to respect different 
cultures and belief systems. 
2) Understanding:  This is reached when we learn who we are and what our 
role in creation is. In our arrogance, we believe t hat humans are not part of 
nature. We are therefore prone to destroying our ha bitat and cannot expect to 
survive for very long. By understanding ourselves, and our reactions to life’s 
events, we can become better able to make changes w e wish to see; with this Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 54 knowledge, which does not always come easily, we ca n map our response to 
life. Gandhi advocated for understanding and dialog ue. When well practiced at 
personal level, the philosophy of nonviolence will help to foster dialogue. 
3) Acceptance:  This is the first step to tolerance. Acceptance do es not 
necessarily equate to approval. However, it is a co nscious decision to see value 
and inherent worth of others. One needs a level of humility to cultivate 
acceptance. This is attained when we accept differe nces, Physical and 
philosophical between human beings. When these diff erences begin to melt 
away then we accept each other as human beings and can dispense with the 
label that keep people apart. 
4) Appreciation:  This is the recognition of the value and worth of all living 
creatures having the ability to see goodness by lea rning to focus on the good, in 
people rather than on the bad even with some diffic ulty, to see God in all of 
life. Appreciation is a by-product of nonviolence. It implies developing an 
ability to recognise the value and worth in other h uman beings. 
 
3.3. Gandhi’s Philosophy of Nonviolence in Politics  
Gandhi’s experiments with truth led him to sample m any political approaches. 
These can be examined by measuring it against two t rends in western political 
thinking: Anarchism and Conservatism. On one hand, Gandhi strove to conserve 
many things like his religious convictions, local l anguages, etc.  However, his 
infusion of his Satyagraha from which he developed his concepts of trusteeship 
and Constructive programme sees him deviating from some of his hereditary 
traditions, like untouchability.  
In Gandhi too, we may find some elements of anarchi cal thought. He strove for 
the “greatest good of all”. He believed this could be realized only; 
In a classless and stateless democracy of autonomou s village 
communities based on nonviolence instead of coercio n, on service 
instead of exploitation, on renunciation instead of  acquisitiveness Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 55 and on the largest measure of local and individual initiative 
instead of centralization. 16  
It is not easy to just refer to Gandhi’s political ideas as just conservative or 
anarchist. The former label is rightly dismissed as  doing injustice to the 
important elements of rationalism, radicalism and i ndividualism on Gandhi. The 
latter makes central those references to a future i deal society, which for 
Gandhi were peripheral to his preoccupation with pr esent means. Attempts to 
place Gandhi in the Development of political theory  have led to an insight into 
Gandhi’s Dialectics. 
 
3.3.1. Gandhi’s Dialectics 
The Gandhian Dialectic is understood side-by-side H egel and Marx’s. In Hegel, 
there is insistence on the objective absolute and o n the inexorable march of 
History.  For Marx, both the direction and structur e of conflict is 
predetermined.  Gandhi lays emphasis on the very pr ocess by which conflict is 
to be resolved. The Hegelian dialectic is a system of logic describing inherent 
natural processes.  Marxian dialectic is a method b y which both the direction 
and the structure of conflict are predetermined. Ga ndhian dialectic describes a 
process of a technique of action to any situation o f human conflict, a process 
essentially creative and inherently constructive. 
Gandhi, in his dialectics, is preoccupied with the problem of means and ends. 
In his Satyagraha, he propounds the nonduality of m eans and ends. The means 
precede the ends in time but there can be no questi on of moral priority. Truth 
is inseparable from nonviolence and the method of a chieving and clinging to 
the truth is nonviolence. Gandhi has referred to no nviolence as being both the 
end and the means. Shortly before his death, Gandhi  commented in a prayer 
speech in New Delhi that “means and ends are conver tible terms”. 17  
The problem of means and ends has been a very centr al issue in political 
philosophy. The schools really concerned with these  are Marxism and Liberal 
democratic theory. Gandhi’s Philosophy of nonviolen ce supercedes these Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 56 schools because of this convertibility of means and  ends. The dialectic implicit 
in the Gandhian method of Satyagraha is not depende nt upon Gandhi’s 
metaphysical assumptions, nor upon his Hindu based theology. It could operate 
in NonHindu societies as it did among the Muslim Pa thans in the North West 
frontier province. 
 
3.3.2. The Place of Civil Disobedience in Gandhi’s Political Philosophy  
The two crucial points in Gandhi’s Politics are tho se of obedience to the law 
and the employment of Force. He was much concerned with the duty of the 
citizen in the imperfect states of the world. He co operated with the 
Government but never condoned laws that disregarded  the human person. In 
his Famous letter to the Viceroy, Inaugurating the Noncooperation Movement in 
1921, Gandhi confessed openly that “From a staunch loyalist and cooperator, I 
have become an uncompromising, disaffectionist and noncooperator” 18  
In Gandhian Satyagraha Civil disobedience is justif ied. One should disobey such 
laws as are in themselves bad and obedience to whic h should be inconsistent 
with one’s self respect.  One should disobey Laws o f state that lack moral 
turpitude. He warns however that: Disobedience to t he civil must be sincere, 
respectful, restrained, never defiant, must be base d upon some well 
understood principle, must not be capricious and ab ove all must have no ill-will 
or hatred behind it 19 .

CHAPTER FOUR  
  
4.0. HOW RELEVANT IS GANDHI’s NONVIOLENCE?  
Nonviolence is a philosophy, an existing theory and  a practice, a lifestyle, and a 
means of social, political and economic struggle as  old as history itself. From 
ancient times to the present times, people have ren ounced violence as a means 
of resolving disputes. They have opted instead for negotiation, mediation and 
reconciliation, thereby resisting violence with a m ilitant and uncompromising 
nonviolence and respect for the integrity of all hu man beings, friends and 
enemies alike. 
Nonviolence provides us with tools, the positive me ans to oppose and stop wars 
and preparations for war, to resist violence, to st ruggle against racial, sexual 
and economic oppression and discrimination and to s eek social justice and 
genuine democracy for people throughout the world. In a very real sense, 
nonviolence is the leaven for the bread that is a n ew society freed from 
oppression and bloodshed, a world in which persons can fulfill their individual 
potentials to the fullest. 
In the preceding chapters, we have sought to expose  Gandhi’s philosophy of 
nonviolence. Some pertinent questions remain almost  unanswered: Does 
Gandhi’s philosophy have any relevance in our conte mporary world, in Africa 
and in the church? How can Gandhi’s nonviolence be applied? These questions 
will be tackled in this chapter and in the chapters  that follow before the 
evaluations and conclusion. 
 
4.1. Relevance of Gandhi’s Philosophy of Nonviolenc e 
Gandhi provided the world with his timeless philoso phy. It was not meant for 
the independence of India only. Nonviolence is itse lf normative. It applies to 
any situation. Gandhi’s nonviolence remains an auth entic source of normative Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 60 personalism meaning that it aims first of all to re -instate the dignity of the 
human person. He was a fearless advocate of the dig nity of the human person. 
This involves recognising the unique endowments of the human person-in-
community and providing a foundation for Human Righ ts. He is therefore called 
the emancipator of the oppressed. He helped million s of the discriminated poor 
to discover meaning in life and live a life worthy of the true human calling. The 
clarity of the conviction of the transcendental goa l of everyman led him to 
affirm the dignity of the human person at every lev el. He aimed at a Theo-
anthropocentric society where the human person was at the centre of the 
social order. No doubt, Kesavulu sees Gandhian Trus teeship as an “Instrument 
of Human Dignity”.  1 
Though Gandhi is dead, his philosophy remains alive . No doubt Jones reminds us 
“Gandhi is not finished. He is a living power, more  powerful in death than life”.  
2 Gandhi presents to us through his principles, the means of fighting for civil 
rights. In the face of oppressor nations, Gandhi ad vises us to simply withdraw 
cooperation with the conqueror, and accept the cons equences. Though some 
will be butchered, they remain martyrs in the movem ent. The jails would be 
overflowed and become ridiculous, for those jailed would be heroes of the new 
nation emerging. The jails would be the training gr ound, the classroom, for the 
new leadership. All the time, when the oppressor be comes oppressive, he 
would become weaker and all the time, the oppressed  would resist the 
oppressor with the spirit of nonviolence, he would become stronger. It would 
be a losing battle for the oppressor and he would h ave to succumb, be 
converted or collapse. Gandhi’s greatest achievemen t lies in the fact that he 
used this philosophy to overcome the system the Bri tish had set up in India.  
 
4.2. Applications of Nonviolence 
Through Gandhi, we now understand that the philosop hy of nonviolence can be 
applied in economics, politics, religion, society e tc. Gandhi’s Satyagraha has 
been applied to bring about useful changes. Many pe ople all through the Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 61 centuries have strove to follow Gandhi’s spirit thr ough seminars, workshops, 
writing of books and articles, projects, and strike s. Gandhi’s spirit keeps on 
hovering in this world. 
India’s turbulent and violent post-independence his tory has nevertheless 
included two trends of nonviolent action and resist ance. In one of these, those 
influenced by Gandhi’s ideas on economics and simpl icity conducted the 
“Sarvodaya” movement, which combined his ideas with  a call for nonviolent 
revolution. More recently, social movements concern ed with the natural 
environment and the effects of development and chan ges both on the 
environment and the livelihood of the people have t urned to nonviolent protest 
and defiance of the state.  
Many institutes have been founded to propagate Gand hi’s philosophy of 
Nonviolence. These have applied nonviolence in the prisons, in curing drug 
addicts, in understanding anger, in resolving confl icts, and in fighting for civil 
rights. Notable among these institutes are the M.K.  Gandhi’s Institute for 
Nonviolence, Memphis, founded by Arun Gandhi, The A lbert Einstein Institution 
founded by Gene Sharp, GandhiServe Foundation, Berl in, Germany, Sarvodaya 
Trust, and many other internet sources. 
Among all the examples of the application of nonvio lence in newspapers and 
magazines, one is most outstanding: The application  of Gandhi’s Philosophy of 
Nonviolence in the Football field. E.S. Reddy relat es it thus: 
The Hindu carried a report from London on December 26th that a 
British company had produced a football T-shirt wit h Gandhi’s 
image on the chest. It is being sold for 20 pounds or about 30 
dollars. The company …said it had chosen Gandhi as a means of 
promoting nonviolence on the football field – winni ng a tackle 
though nonviolent methodology. 3 
The British football fans that are notorious for ro wdy behaviour do need some 
education in nonviolence. Gandhi was fond of footba ll and was head of football 
clubs in Durban and Johannesburg in South Africa al most a hundred years ago. Africa Needs Gandhi

4.3. Application of Gandhi’s Doctrine by Some Promi nent Figures 
Among individuals who have applied Gandhi’s nonviol ence, many figures are 
outstanding. The first three that will be mentioned  are not of African roots. 
Since the work focuses on Gandhi’s relevance especi ally for Africa, we shall 
move from general to particular. The next six will be personalities who are 
either totally Africans or African-Americans. Most of these quote Gandhi to 
justify their nonviolent action. 
 
4.3.1. César Estrada Chávez (1927-1993), A Student and Follower of 
Gandhi 
César Chávez was born on March 31, 1927, near his f amily’s farm in Yuma, 
Arizona. At age 10, his family became migrant farm workers after losing their 
farm in the Great Depression. Throughout his youth and into his adulthood, 
César migrated across the southwest labouring in th e fields and vineyards, 
where he was exposed to the hardships and injustice s of farm worker life. For 
more than three decades he led the first successful  farm workers union in 
American history, achieving dignity, respect, fair wages, medical coverage, 
pension benefits, and humane living conditions, as well as countless other 
rights and protections for hundreds of thousands of  farm workers. César used 
peaceful tactics such as fasts, boycotts, strikes, and pilgrimages to bring about 
justice for farm workers. In 1968 César fasted for 25 days to affirm his personal 
commitment and that of the farm labour movement to nonviolence. 4 The story 
of César Estrada Chávez also ends near Yuma, Arizon a. He passed away 
peacefully on April 23, 1993, in San Luis, a small village nearby. 
He read much about St. Francis of Assisi and Mohand as K. Gandhi and was 
influenced by both of these men, as well as the Civ il Rights Leader Martin 
Luther King, Jr. he realized great men were those w ho set a good example, and 
he adopted the philosophy of nonviolence. He is kno wn as a great prophet of 
nonviolence. His nonviolence rested in a deep faith fulness to God who can bring Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 63 about transformation. He was clear that nonviolence  is the way of God. His life 
and work always reflected that he was first a farm worker who spoke from the 
plight of a much oppressed working group in this af fluent country. Few have 
been known to so take on the plight of the poor.  
From his lifestyle, we can affirm without mincing w ords that César responded 
to Gandhi’s assertion that “nonviolence is not pass ivity in any shape or form . 
Nonviolence is the most active force in the world.”   For him, we must respect 
all human life. Nonviolence is the only weapon that  is compassionate and 
recognizes each person’s value.  César went further  to describe nonviolence for 
his movement as “aggressive nonviolence.” In effect  he held that Militant 
nonviolence is our means for social revolution and to achieve justice for our 
people. 
Perhaps most notable in his pursuit of nonviolence was his call to fasting. Like 
Gandhi, he came to know for himself the special pur ification of fasting, 
particularly in overcoming violence. He fasted for 21 days in 1968 and at the 
end he said, “I am not completely nonviolent yet, a nd I know it. That is why I 
fasted; I felt it was a very personal form of self- testing and of prayer. Anyone 
could be nonviolent in a monastery. What’s difficul t is to be nonviolent in the 
cause, in the battle for social justice.” With his acceptance of self suffering 
through fasting, he inscribed himself into the Saty agraha doctrine of Gandhi. 
His nonviolence rested in a deep faithfulness to Go d who can bring about 
transformation. César was clear that nonviolence is  the way of God. This way 
included for him a deep respect for all living bein gs, including animals, and was 
manifest in his staunch vegetarianism. 5 
Some of César E. Chávez core values and quotations can be outlined below 6:  
1. Acceptance of all People – “We need to help students and parents cherish 
and preserve the ethnic and cultural diversity that  nourishes and strengthens 
…this nation.” 
2. Celebrating Community - “We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and 
forget about progress and prosperity for our commun ity … Our ambitions must Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 64 be broad enough to include the aspirations and need s of others, for their sakes 
and for our own.” 
3. Respect for Life and the Environment – “However important the struggle is 
and however much misery and poverty and degradation  exist, we know that it 
cannot be more important than one human life.” 
4. NonViolence –“Nonviolence is not inaction. It is not discussion . It is not for 
the timid or weak …Nonviolence is hard work. It is the willingness to sacrifice. 
It is the patience to win.” “There’s no such thing as defeat in nonviolence.” 
5. Innovation – “A lasting organization is one in which people wi ll continue to 
build, develop and move when you are not there.” 
6. A Preference to Help the Most Needy – “We are tired of words, of 
betrayals, of indifference 
…the years are gone when the farm worker said nothi ng and did nothing to help 
himself…Now we have new faith. Through our strong w ill, our movement is 
changing these conditions…We shall be heard.” 
7. Knowledge - “Students must have initiative; they should not b e mere 
imitators. They must learn to think and act for the mselves and be free.” 
8. Sacrifice – “I am convinced that the truest act of courage, t he strongest act 
of [humanity], is to sacrifice ourselves for others  in a totally nonviolent struggle 
for justice. To be [human] is to suffer for others.  God help us to be human.” 
9. Service to Others – “When we are really honest with ourselves we must  
admit that our lives are all that really belong to us. So, it is how we use our 
lives that determine what kind of [people] we are. It is my deepest belief that 
only by giving our lives do we find life.” 
10. Determination –“We draw our strength from the very despair in whi ch we 
have been forced to live. We shall endure.”

His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is  both the head of state and 
the spiritual leader of Tibet. He was born on 6 Jul y 1935, to a farming family, 
in Taktser, Amdo, Northeastern Tibet.  At the age o f two the child, who was 
named Lhamo Dhondup at that time, was recognized as  the reincarnation of the 
13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso. 7 He began his monastic education at the age 
of six. 8 
In 1950 he was called upon to assume full political  power after Chinas invasion 
of Tibet in 1949.  In 1954, he went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong 
and other Chinese leaders, including Deng Xiaoping and Chou Enlai.  But finally, 
in 1959, with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan  national uprising in Lhasa by 
Chinese troops, he was forced to escape into exile.   Since then he has been 
living in Dharamsala, northern India, the seat of t he Tibetan political 
administration in exile.  
He took many Peace Initiatives worth mentioning her e.  In September 1987 he 
proposed the Five Point Peace Plan for Tibet as the  first step towards a 
peaceful solution to the worsening situation in Tib et.  He envisaged that Tibet 
would become a sanctuary; a zone of peace at the he art of Asia, where all 
sentient beings can exist in harmony and the delica te environment can be 
preserved. China has so far failed to respond posit ively to the various peace 
proposals he put forward.  
Gandhi played an important role in the life of The Dalai Lama. During the 
campaign led by the Dalai Lama for the independence  of Tibet from China he 
has famously insisted that Tibet will be free when China is free and that his 
people should not take up arms against, or hate, th e Chinese people. When he 
spoke on November 4 2005 at Memorial Church Stanfor d, the Dalai Lama said 
nonviolence is the only way progress can be made wi th China. 9  
Tibetan Buddhism is very much in harmony with Gandh ian nonviolence. In fact, 
the Dalai Lama said this of Gandhi: Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 66 I have the greatest admiration and respect for Maha tma Gandhi. 
He was a great human being with a deep understandin g of human 
nature. He made every effort to encourage the full development 
of the positive aspects of the human potential and to reduce or 
restrain the negative. His life has inspired me eve r since I was a 
small boy. Ahimsa or nonviolence is the powerful id ea that 
Mahatma Gandhi made familiar throughout the world. But 
nonviolence does not mean the mere absence of viole nce. It is 
something more positive, more meaningful than that,  for it 
depends wholly on the power of truth. The true expr ession of 
nonviolence is compassion. Some people seem to thin k that 
compassion is just a passive emotional response ins tead of a 
rational stimulus to action. To experience genuine compassion is to 
develop a feeling of closeness to others combined w ith a sense of 
responsibility for their welfare. This develops whe n we accept that 
other people are just like ourselves in wanting hap piness and not 
wanting suffering. What is the relevance of nonviol ence and 
compassion to the future of humanity? As Mahatma Ga ndhi showed 
by his own example, nonviolence can be implemented not only in 
politics but also in day-to-day life. That was his great 
achievement. He showed that nonviolence should be a ctive in 
helping others. Nonviolence means that if you can h elp and serve 
others, you should do so. If you cannot, you must a t least restrain 
yourself from harming others. I believe that it is very important 
that we find positive ways in which children and ad ults can be 
educated in the path of compassion, kindness and no nviolence. If 
we can actively do this, I believe we will be fulfi lling Mahatma 
Gandhi’s legacy to us. It is my prayer that, as we enter this new 
century, nonviolence and dialogue will increasingly  come to govern 
all human relations. 10  Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 67 In effect, the Dalai Lama thinks and insists that i n terms of basic 
human feeling, violence is not good.  For him nonvi olence as preached by 
Gandhi is the only way.  
From so many of his other quotes, one can see the i nfluence of Gandhi on him 
and especially his way of applying Gandhi’s doctrin e: 
When we face problems or disagreements today, we ha ve to arrive 
at solutions through dialogue.  Dialogue is the onl y appropriate 
method.  One-sided victory is no longer relevant.  We must work to 
resolve conflicts in a spirit of reconciliation and  always keep in 
mind the interests of others.  We cannot destroy ou r neighbours! 
We cannot ignore their interests!  Doing so would u ltimately cause 
us to suffer.  I therefore think that the concept o f violence is now 
unsuitable.  Nonviolence is the appropriate method. ” 11  
Since 1959 he has received over 84 awards, honorary  doctorates, prizes, etc., 
in recognition of his message of peace, nonviolence , inter-religious 
understanding, universal responsibility and compass ion.  He has also authored 
more than 72 books. Being a man of peace, His Holin ess the Dalai Lama in 1989 
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolen t appeal for the liberation 
of Tibet.  He has consistently advocated policies o f nonviolence, even in the 
face of extreme aggression. He also became the firs t Nobel Laureate to be 
recognized for his concern for global environmental  problems. 
 
4.3.3. Aung San Suu Kyi, Prisoner of Conscience and  Advocate of Nonviolent 
Resistance 
Aung San Suu Kyi born 19 June 1945 is a Burmese opp osition politician and 
General Secretary of the National League for Democr acy. She was educated in 
Methodist English High School (Now known as Basic E ducation High School No.1 
Dagon)  for much of her childhood in Burma where sh e was noted as having a 
talent for learning languages. She is a Theravada B uddhist. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 68 In 1964, Aung San Suu Kyi graduated from Lady Shri Ram College with a degree 
in politics in New Delhi. Suu Kyi continued her edu cation at St Hugh’s College, 
Oxford, obtaining a B.A. degree in Philosophy, Poli tics, and Economics in 1969. 
After graduating, she lived in New York City with a  family friend and worked at 
the United Nations for three years, primarily on bu dget matters. In 1972, she 
got married to Dr. Michael Aris, a scholar of Tibet an culture, living abroad in 
Bhutan. She earned a Ph.D. at the School of Orienta l and African Studies, 
University of London in 1985. In 1988 Suu Kyi retur ned to Burma at first to tend 
for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-dem ocracy movement. 
Influenced by both Mahatma Gandhi‘s philosophy of n onviolence and by more 
specifically Buddhist concepts, Aung San Suu Kyi en tered politics to work for 
democratisation, helped found the National League f or Democracy on 27 
September 1988, and was put under house arrest on 2 0 July 1989. She was 
offered freedom if she left the country, but she re fused. She gave over a 
thousand speeches between August 1988 and July 1989 —all in direct violation of 
the government's open meeting laws—when she was pla ced under house arrest. 
Her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD) carried over 80% of the 
1990 vote. She remains under house arrest, and Burm a remains under a military 
dictatorship. Suu Kyi has received more than 80 int ernational awards, including 
India’s Gandhi Award (2009), the Jawaharlal Nehru A ward for International 
Understanding by the Government of India (1993) and  the 1991 Nobel Peace 
Prize. Suu Kyi was the recipient of the Rafto Prize  and the Sakharov Prize for 
Freedom of Thought in 1990.  
On 2 May 2008, after Cyclone Nargis hit Burma, Suu Kyi lost her roof and was 
living in virtual darkness after losing electricity  in her dilapidated lakeside 
residence. She used candles at night as she was not  provided any generator set. 
Plans to renovate and repair the house were announc ed in August 2009.  
One of her most famous speeches is the “ Freedom From Fear ” (1991) speech, 
which begins, “It is not power that corrupts but fe ar. Fear of losing power 
corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge  of power corrupts those 
who are subject to it.” 12 She also believes fear spurs many world leaders to lose Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 69 sight of their purpose. She also has several famous  books and essays such as 
“Aung San Of Burma: a Biographical Portrait by his Daughter” (1991), “The 
Voice of Hope” (1997) and “Letters from Burma” (199 7). She has expressed her 
ideology and beliefs in writing and in speech. 
The story of Aung San Suu Kyi is a moving example o f the power of nonviolence. 
Even though she was not able to entirely secure an effective umbrella 
organization to coordinate the resistance, nor impl ement what Gandhi calls 
“constructive program”, she led the Burmese people in a campaign for a 
democratic government.  She is frequently called Da w Aung San Suu Kyi.  Daw is 
an honorific similar to madam for older, revered wo men, literally meaning 
“aunt”. It is thanks to the power of nonviolence in  Burma that Ravindra Kumar 
insisted that: 
 “Today, it is not possible for military dictators. ..like that of 
Burma to dishonour an international call. If throug h a resolution of 
the United Nations the dictators of such a country are warned by 
international community of non-cooperation, restric tions or 
sanctions and boycott then this act, according to m e, will be 
within the scope of nonviolent Gandhian way” 13 .  
 
4.3.4. Kwame Nkrumah and his Gandhi Inspired Positi ve Action  
Kwame Nkrumah was born on September 21, 1909, at Nk roful in what was then 
the British-ruled Gold Coast, the son of a goldsmit h. He was trained as a 
teacher after which he went to the United States in  1935 for advanced studies 
and continued his schooling in England, where he he lped organize the Pan-
African Congress in 1945. He returned to Ghana in 1 947 and became the general 
secretary of the newly founded United Gold Coast Co nvention but split from it 
in 1949 to form the Convention People’s party (CPP) . 
After his ‘positive action’ (nonviolence) campaign created disturbances in 1950, 
Nkrumah was jailed, but when the CPP swept the 1951  elections, he was freed 
to form a government, and he led the colony to inde pendence as Ghana in Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 70 1957. A firm believer in African liberation, Nkruma h pursued a radical pan-
African policy, playing a key role in the formation  of the Organization of African 
Unity in 1963. As head of government, he was less s uccessful however, and as 
time passed he was accused of forming a dictatorshi p. In 1964 he formed a one-
party state, with himself as president for life, an d was accused of actively 
promoting a cult of his own personality. Overthrown  by the military in 1966, 
with the help of western backing, he spent his last  years in exile, dying in 
Bucharest, Romania, on April 27, 1972. His legacy a nd dream of a “United 
States of Africa” still remains a goal among many. His numerous writings 
address Africa’s political destiny. 14  
If Nkrumah was successful, he owed part of his form ation, directly or indirectly 
to Gandhi. Nkrumah became a disciple of Mahatma Gan dhi’s nonviolent 
strategy of “Satyagraha”, which he coined as “Posit ive Action.” 15 
Here is a summary of what his positive action is al l about: 
Positive action has already achieved remarkable suc cess in the 
liberation struggle of our continent and I feel sur e that it can 
further save us from the perils of this atomic arro gance. If the 
direct action that was carried out by the internati onal protest 
team were to be repeated on a mass scale, or simult aneously from 
various parts of Africa, the result could be as pow erful and as 
successful as Gandhi’s historic Salt March. We salu te Mahatma 
Gandhi and we remember, in tribute to him that it w as in South 
Africa that his method of nonviolence and noncooper ation was first 
practiced in the struggle against the vicious race discrimination 
that still plagues that unhappy country. But now po sitive action 
with nonviolence, as advocated by us, has found exp ression in 
South Africa in the defiance of the oppressive pass  laws. This 
defiance continues in spite of the murder of unarme d men, 
women, and children by the South African Government . We are 
sure that the will of the majority will ultimately prevail, for no 
government can continue to impose its rule in face of the Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 71 conscious defiance of the overwhelming masses of it s people. 
There is no force, however impregnable, that a unit ed and 
determined people cannot overcome. 16  
Nkrumah was totally committed to the liberation of Africa from his student 
days to his death.  The ideals of freedom, equality , independence, and social 
justice inspired him so much. These convictions und erpinned his ambitions for 
self-determination for the Gold Coast, as Ghana was  called at the time. He 
envisioned all social groups in African society had  a role to play in mobilising 
for political independence via a campaign of “Posit ive Action.” 17 He adopted 
the Gandhian strategy of boycotts, strikes, leaflet ing, and educational 
campaigns included women, youth groups, farmers ass ociations and trade 
unions. 18 
African unity was the only solution by which Africa ns could regain their respect, 
dignity and equality in the world. On this note, he  formed the Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU) in May 1963. The intention was to win over his 
contemporaries to achieve Continental Union Governm ent for Africa. For him,  
We need the strength of our combined numbers and re sources to 
protect ourselves from the very positive dangers of  returning 
colonialism in disguised forms. We need it to comba t the 
entrenched forces dividing our continent and still holding back 
millions of our brothers. We need it to secure tota l African 
liberation. 19 
As independence dawned in some parts of Africa, rep ression had mounted in 
others. The Gold Coast having become the independen t state of Ghana in 1957, 
the All African Peoples' Conference was organised i n Accra in 1958. A 
posthumously published work by Kwame Nkrumah reprod uces the provisional 
agenda prepared for the conference: “The main purpo se of the All-African 
Peoples' Conference to be held in Accra, Ghana, in December 1958, will be to 
formulate concrete plans and work out the Gandhian tactics and strategy of the 
African Nonviolent Revolution….” 20  Gandhi actually inspired his Positive Action. 
Nevertheless, Nkrumah was also accused of dictators hip and we must insist that Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 72 not all his doctrine are in line with Gandhi totall y. But we praised his little 
efforts to follow Gandhi. 
 
4.3.5. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela: Leadership Qualit ies based on Gandhi’s 
Spirit 
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born in Transkei, Sou th Africa on July 18, 1918. 
His father was Chief Henry Mandela of the Tembu Tri be. Mandela himself was 
educated at University College of Fort Hare and the  University of 
Witwatersrand and qualified in law in 1942. He join ed the African National 
Congress (ANC) in 1944 and was engaged in resistanc e against the ruling 
National Party’s apartheid policies after 1948.  In  response to Apartheid, the 
African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) laun ched a campaign of 
Gandhi-inspired acts of civil resistance and nonvio lent noncooperation. Mandela 
travelled across the country as the ANCYL’s nationa l volunteer-in-chief, 
recruiting volunteers and coordinating protests.  
He went on trial for treason in 1956-1961 and was a cquitted in 1961. On June 
12, 1964, eight of the accused, including Mandela, were sentenced to life 
imprisonment. From 1964 to 1982, he was incarcerate d at Robben Island Prison, 
off Cape Town; thereafter, he was at Pollsmoor Pris on, nearby on the 
mainland. 
During his years in prison, Nelson Mandela’s reputa tion grew steadily. He was 
widely accepted as the most significant black leade r in South Africa and 
became a potent symbol of resistance as the anti-ap artheid movement 
gathered strength. He consistently refused to compr omise his political position 
to obtain his freedom. 
Nelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. A fter his release, he 
plunged himself wholeheartedly into his life’s work , striving to attain the goals 
he and others had set out almost four decades earli er. In 1991, at the first 
national conference of the ANC held inside South Af rica after the organization Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 73 had been banned in 1960, Mandela was elected Presid ent of the ANC. In 1993 
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  
On 10 May 1994 Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as th e first democratically 
elected State President of South Africa on and was President until June 1999. 
As president, Mandela presided over the transition from minority rule and 
apartheid. His advocacy of reconciliation led to in ternational acclaim and 
importantly the trust of the White African populati on.21 In 1999, Mandela 
received the Gandhi/King Award for Nonviolence from  the World Movement for 
Nonviolence. The prize was presented by Ms. Ela Gan dhi, granddaughter of 
Mahatma Gandhi and a then-member of the South Afric an parliament, a 
position she could not have held prior to the end o f apartheid. Ms. Gandhi 
described Mandela as the living legacy of Mahatma G andhi, the Gandhi of South 
Africa. 
Although they never met, Gandhi and Mandela are oft en mentioned together as 
giants of 20th-century anti-colonialism. South Afri can leader Nelson Mandela 
described Mohandas Gandhi as “the archetypical anti -colonial revolutionary” 
and acknowledged the earlier leader’s influence on the independence 
movement in South Africa. 22 
Both Gandhi and Mandela began their careers as west ern-trained lawyers. Both 
served terms in Johannesburg’s infamous Fort prison  for their activism. Mandela 
himself often cited Gandhi as an inspiration and cl aimed the Indian leader as a 
son of South Africa, stating that “India gave South  Africa Gandhi the barrister 
and Africa gave India back Mahatma Gandhi the Great  Soul.”23 The leadership 
qualities of Nelson Mandela had at its base Gandhi’ s Spirit. When Mandela spent 
27 years of his life in Robben Island in the prison , the room was full of books of 
Gandhi and many other classics. The twenty seven ye ars he spent in jail were 
spent in meditation and reflection and it is said t hat throughout the years, the 
bitterness left his soul and he provided the leader ship to steer South Africa to 
be a multi ethnic state. Mandela stands tall amongs t our contemporary leaders, 
for his ability to forge unity amongst traditional enemies. 24 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 74 Gandhi’s influence on Mandela was shown by the Indi an Prime Minister 
Manmohan Singh.  Visiting South Africa on the 137th  anniversary of Mahatma 
Gandhi’s birthday, Singh described Mandela as the g reatest Gandhian for 
transforming the lives of millions. Singh said Gand hi would have been “elated” 
to see his aspirations of peace and reconciliation realized in the transformation 
of South Africa under Mandela’s leadership.  In the  eyes of the world, the 
mantle of Gandhi seemed to have “descended” on Mand ela.25 In fact, Nelson 
Mandela is “An Icon of his age.”26 
Mandela tried his best to follow Gandhi in everythi ng, though he differed from 
him at some point:  
Gandhi remained committed to nonviolence; I followe d the 
Gandhian strategy for as long as I could, but then there came a 
point in our struggle when the brute force of the o ppressor could 
no longer be countered through passive resistance a lone. We 
founded Umkhonto we Sizwe  and added a military dimension to 
our struggle. Even then we chose sabotage because i t did not 
involve the loss of life, and it offered the best h ope for future race 
relations. 27 
This behaviour of Mandela would never have happened  to Gandhi! But he still 
traces the roots of his philosophy of life to Gandh i. 
 
4.3.6. Martin Luther King Jr: The Gandhi influenced  Peacemaker Hero 
While commemorating the 50 th  Anniversary of the visit of Martin Luther to India  
from February 10, 1959 to March 10, 1959, in Washin gton DC on Feb 11 2009, 
The US House of Representative unanimously passed a  resolution recognizing 
the influence Mahatma Gandhi had on Martin Luther K ing Jr, the great civil 
rights leader of America who has been a source of i nspiration to President 
Barack Obama. Observing that the great American lea der was tremendously 
influenced by the nonviolence philosophy of Gandhi,  the resolution says King 
encountered this during his study of Gandhi, and wa s further inspired by him Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 75 during his first trip to India. King successfully u sed this in the struggle for civil 
rights and voting rights. The trip to India made a profound impact on Dr. King 
and inspired him to use nonviolence as an instrumen t of social change to end 
segregation and racial discrimination in America th roughout the rest of his work 
during the Civil Rights Movement, the Congressional  resolution says. 28 During a 
period of soul-searching, he had, in his words, “de spaired of the power of love 
in solving social problems.” At this point, he was coincidentally introduced to 
the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi in a sermon by Morde cai Johnson, president of 
Howard University, who had just returned from a tri p to India.  
But which Martin Luther King are we talking about? Not the one at the base of 
the 16 th  Century revolution, but the one Nick Campbell from  Juneau, Alaska 
ranked as the PEACEMAKER HERO. Martin Luther King J r. was born in Atlanta on 
Sunset Adams Street in 1929. He was also a paper bo y. His mom taught him to 
read before he went to school. He read books about black people who were 
heroes, like George Washington Carver. Jim Crow Law s were laws that 
separated blacks from whites. Martin’s parents did not like segregation, which 
means keeping blacks and whites apart. The situatio n was such that black 
people had to sit in the uncomfortable chairs and t he white people had all the 
comfortable chairs. More to that, there were lots o f restaurants open for whites 
and hardly any open for blacks. Worst still, blacks  had to use different drinking 
fountains from whites. And above all, they had to p ray without whites in 
church. Blacks were cursed, chased, lynched and kil led, just because of the 
colour of their skin. When blacks came into the sto res, white people wouldn’t 
answer their questions. King married Coretta Scott in 1953 and she proved to be 
a real companion. On Dec. 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refus ed to give up her seat on a 
bus to a white person. It started a Montgomery bus boycott of the buses by the 
black people. They didn’t know if it would work, be cause no one else had tried 
it before. But the bus boycott worked. It took one year to change the rules. 
Martin Luther King Jr. was the president of the Mon tgomery Improvement 
Association. He believed that love, not violence, w as the most powerful 
weapon, just like Gandhi believed. King was encoura ged after the successful 
Montgomery bus boycott in 1956 to visit India. By t he time he accepted Prime Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 76 Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s invitation to visit Ind ia in 1959, the civil rights 
activist saw himself as a “pilgrim to Gandhi’s land .” 29 Martin told people not to 
obey unjust laws. The Children's March of Spring, 1 963, played a central role in 
the advancement of Civil Rights. The Children's Mar ch’s original goal was to 
desegregate downtown stores in Birmingham. People w atched on TV and 
started thinking about black people’s rights.  
King is very famous for The Letter from Birmingham Jail or Letter from 
Birmingham City Jail. It is an open letter written on April 16, 1963 from the city 
jail in Birmingham, Alabama, where he was confined after being arrested for 
his part in the Birmingham campaign, a planned non- violent protest conducted 
by the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and King's Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference against racial segr egation by Birmingham's city 
government and downtown retailers. King’s letter is  a response to a statement 
made by eight white Alabama clergymen on April 12, 1963, titled “A Call For 
Unity”. The clergymen agreed that social injustices  existed but argued that the 
battle against racial segregation should be fought solely in the courts, not in 
the streets. King responded that without nonviolent  forceful direct actions such 
as his, true civil rights could never be achieved. As he put it, “This ‘Wait’ has 
almost always meant ‘Never.’” He asserted that not only was civil disobedience 
justified in the face of unjust laws, but that “one  has a moral responsibility to 
disobey unjust laws.” The letter includes the famou s statement “Injustice 
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” as wel l as the words attributed to 
William Ewart Gladstone quoted by King: “Justice to o long delayed is justice 
denied.” 
His popularity grew after his “I Have a Dream” spee ch delivered 28 August 
1963, at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C. Many  assert that this dream 
was realized with the ascending of Obama as preside nt of the USA. Martin was 
against the Vietnam War. He did not like violence. Martin was 39 when he was 
killed.  
The impact Gandhi made on him is best described in his own words:  Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 77 As I read his works I became deeply fascinated by h is campaigns of 
nonviolent resistance. The whole Gandhian concept o f 
Satyagraha…was profoundly significant to me. As I d elved deeper 
into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concer ning the power 
of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for  the first time 
its potency in the area of social reform. 30  
By this, King put Gandhian method of nonviolence as  one of the most potent 
weapons available to an oppressed people in their s truggle for freedom. What 
fascinated King most in Gandhi was The ‘turn-the-ot her-cheek’ philosophy and 
the ‘love-your-enemies’ philosophy which Gandhi dre w from the Sermon on the 
Mount. He therefore came to realize that Gandhi was  the first person in history 
to reinvent the Christian ethic of love as a potent  instrument for social and 
collective transformation. It was a short journey t hereafter to unreserved 
acceptance of the Gandhian technique of nonviolence  as the only viable means 
to overcome the problems faced by his people. 31 In Gandhi’s teaching he found 
the answer to a question that had long troubled him : How does one set about 
carrying out a social reform? He found in the nonvi olent resistance philosophy 
of Gandhi the only morally and practically sound me thod open to oppressed 
people in their struggle for freedom. King therefor e advocated and practiced 
civil disobedience and nonviolence. Before he had r ead about Gandhi, he had 
almost concluded that the teaching of Jesus could o nly be put into practice as 
between individuals; but after making a study of Ga ndhi he realized that he 
had been mistaken.  
Commenting on the relationship that existed between  King and Gandhi, John 
Odey attests that King’s reverence for Gandhi was s uch that he “kept on 
reminding the blacks of the momentous need to condu ct themselves in the 
spirit of Christ and that of Gandhi. It would there fore appear that he and 
Gandhi were the same in every bit of their concepti on of nonviolence and the 
application of its techniques.”32 While there are many remarkable similarities 
between the two, they also differed slightly in som e areas. But their objectives 
were the same, to free the oppressed. There’s a vas t difference in Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 78 accomplishment between King and the others listed a bove.  Most thinkers say 
that King remains one of those rare gems that tried  to follow Gandhi to the 
latter. He died a real satyagrahi. 
 
4.3.7. Desmond Mpilo Tutu, an African Religious Lea der in Love with 
Gandhi 
Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in Klerksdorp, Transvaa l on the 7th  of October 
1931 in South Africa. His father was a teacher, and  he himself was educated at 
Johannesburg Bantu High School. After leaving schoo l he trained first as a 
teacher at Pretoria Bantu Normal College and in 195 4 he graduated from the 
University of South Africa. After three years as a high school teacher he began 
to study theology, being ordained as a priest in 19 60. The years 1962-66 were 
devoted to further theological study in England lea ding up to a Master of 
Theology. From 1967 to 1972 he taught theology in S outh Africa before 
returning to England for three years as the assista nt director of a theological 
institute in London. In 1975 he was appointed Dean of St. Mary’s Cathedral in 
Johannesburg, the first black to hold that position . From 1976 to 1978 he was 
Bishop of Lesotho, and in 1978 became the first bla ck General Secretary of the 
South African Council of Churches. As a vocal and c ommitted opponent of 
apartheid in South Africa he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. He 
was generally credited with coining the term Rainbo w Nation as a metaphor for 
post-apartheid South Africa after 1994 under Africa n National Congress rule. 
The expression has since entered mainstream conscio usness to describe South 
Africa’s ethnic diversity.  Tutu was the first blac k ordained South African 
Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town. Other awards give n to Desmond Tutu 
include The Gandhi Peace Prize in 2007, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for 
Humanitarianism and the Magubela prize for liberty in 1986. 33  
Tutu is an honorary doctor of a number of leading u niversities in the USA, 
Britain and Germany. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 79 Desmond Tutu has formulated his objective as “a dem ocratic and just society 
without racial divisions”, and has set forward the following points as minimum 
demands: 
1. Equal civil rights for all 
2. The abolition of South Africa’s passport laws 
3. A common system of education 
4. The cessation of forced deportation from South A frica to the so-called 
“homelands”. 34 
The concept of reconciliation and forgiveness as wa s practiced in the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission headed by Archbishop Tutu  was influenced by 
Gandhi. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was  established in 1995 to 
deal with the harm that had been caused by Aparthei d to people’s dignity, 
which affected their state of self worth. It unders cored the fact that the 
process of reconciliation is not about forgetting t he past but about 
acknowledging the crimes committed and thereby ackn owledging the other 
person as a human being who had suffered. The perpe trators of crimes relating 
to human rights violations who gave testimony were given the opportunity to 
request amnesty from prosecution. The mandate of th e Commission was to bear 
witness to, record and in some cases, grant amnesty  and reparation as well as 
promote rehabilitation. This process was heavily in fluenced by the traditional 
practices of Ubuntu  societies in South Africa. 35 Ubuntu  is really a quality that 
Gandhi came to share with progressive Africa. It is  our sense of connectedness, 
our sense that my humanity is bound up with your hu manity. Tutu himself says: 
“What dehumanises you, inexorably dehumanises me.” 36 
He received the Mahatma Gandhi Global Nonviolence A ward and from his 
speech, one can depict the influence of Gandhi on A frica:  
Gandhi was to influence greatly Martin Luther King Jr., the leading 
light in the American Civil Rights Movement, as wel l as the South 
African National Congress of Nelson Mandela. So man y, many 
people expected our country to go up in flames, env eloped by a 
catastrophe, a racial bloodbath. It never happened.  It never Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 80 happened because in the struggle against an evil of  injustice, 
ultimately it did not take recourse to violence and  because you 
and so many others in the international community s upported the 
struggle.37 
 
4.3.8. Barack Hussein Obama: A Leader, a symbol of hope and a hero 
inspired by Gandhi 
“You don’t have to fight in a war to be a hero; you  just have to be responsible, 
courageous, loving, trustworthy, respectful and car ing”. Many quote these 
words when contrasting Barack Obama with his predec essor George Bush. The 
former is the first African American President. He is outstandingly intelligent 
and doesn’t want what’s right for him; he wants wha t’s right for the world. 
Obama is a hero. 
Barack Obama was born to a white American mother, A nn Dunham, and a black 
Kenyan father, Barack Obama, Sr., who were both you ng college students at 
the University of Hawaii. When his father left for Harvard, she and Barack 
stayed behind, and his father ultimately returned a lone to Kenya, where he 
worked as a government economist. He was brought up  largely by his 
grandparents. His father wrote to him regularly but , though he travelled around 
the world on official business for Kenya, he visite d only once, when Barack was 
ten. 38  
Obama attended Columbia University, but found New Y ork’s racial tension 
inescapable. He became a community organizer for a small Chicago church-
based group for three years, helping poor South Sid e residents cope with a 
wave of plant closings. He then attended Harvard La w School, and in 1990 
became the first African-American editor of the Har vard Law Review. He turned 
down a prestigious judicial clerkship, choosing ins tead to practice civil-rights 
law back in Chicago, representing victims of housin g and employment 
discrimination and working on voting-rights legisla tion. He also began teaching Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 81 at the University of Chicago Law School, and marrie d Michelle Robinson, a 
fellow attorney.  
His fame started in 1995 when Barack published an a utobiography called, 
Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inherita nce.  His audio version won 
a Grammy. Obama got more involved in politics every  day and decided to run 
for the Illinois State Senate in 1996. After winnin g the seat, he worked to pass 
the first major ethics law in twenty-five years. He  also worked to lower taxes 
and improved health care for everybody.  In 2000, h e ran for the United States 
House of Representatives but lost. He was not disco uraged at all. He was still 
filled with “the Audacity of Hope”. 39 He was always against going to war in Iraq 
and spoke against it during a rally in October 2002 . In 2004 Obama was elected 
to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, representing Illi nois, and he gained national 
attention by giving a rousing and well-received key note speech at the 
Democratic National Convention in Boston. In 2008 h e ran for President, and 
despite having only four years of national politica l experience, he won. In 
January 2009, he was sworn in as the 44 th  President of the United States, and 
the first African-American ever elected to that pos ition. 
He inspires many people by the books he has written , the outstanding speeches 
he gives, his community service and his belief that , together, we can all make 
the world a better place. He also inspires people b y his determination to solve 
problems with other countries through negotiation i nstead of war. He has 
overcome obstacles during his life with great succe ss. His actions throughout his 
life are evidence that he wants to make the world a  better place, influence 
many people to do the same and create a more peacef ul world. Obama is a 
leader and a symbol of hope.   
In September 2009, while visiting Wakefield High Sc hool in Arlington Virginia 
Obama called for students at to take responsibility  and to learn from their 
failures so that they succeed in the end. One of th e students asked him this 
question: “…if you could have dinner with anyone, d ead or alive, who would it 
be?”  “You know, I think that it might be Gandhi, w ho is a real hero of mine,” 
Obama said. From his answer, one can quickly deciph er the impact Gandhi has Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 82 on him. “Now, it would probably be a really small m eal because he didn’t eat a 
lot,” he continued. In a more striking way, Obama i nsisted “But Mahatma 
Gandhi is someone who has inspired people across th e world for the past 
several generations”.  
President Obama also recognized the 140th anniversa ry of Gandhi’s birth saying 
Americans owe him “an enormous measure of gratitude ,” including his 
influence on Dr. King and the Civil Rights movement .  He insisted that America 
“has its roots in the India of Mahatma Gandhi and t he nonviolent social action 
movement for Indian independence which he led”. For  Him Americans are to 
join with Indians in celebrating his life, and find  time “to reflect on his message 
of nonviolence, which continues to inspire people a nd political movements 
across the globe,”   
We can give the examples of how Gandhi influenced O bama. Prior to becoming 
President of the United States, then-Senator Obama noted that: 
throughout my life, I have always looked to Mahatma  Gandhi as an 
inspiration, because he embodies the kind of transf ormational 
change that can be made when ordinary people come t ogether to 
do extraordinary things. That is why his portrait h angs in my 
Senate Office: to remind me that real results will come not just 
from Washington - they will come from the people.40  
Not even nine months as a President, He won the Nob el Peace Prize in October, 
2009 for the hope that he will improve the global c ommunity. He was the 
fourth U.S. President to receive one, and the third  President to win the Nobel 
Peace Prize while still in office. In a speech as h e formally accepted his Nobel 
Peace Prize, the president said that the nonviolenc e practiced by such leaders 
as Gandhi and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. shoul d be a guiding force. Their 
pacifism may not have been practical or even possib le in every circumstance. 
The love they showed and their faith in human progr ess must always be a 
guiding force for any human being. In awarding the prize to Obama, the Nobel 
panel cited his call for a world free of nuclear we apons, for a more engaged 
U.S. role in combating global warming, for his supp ort of the United Nations Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 83 and multilateral diplomacy and for broadly capturin g the attention of the world 
and giving its people “hope.” 41  
Although Mahatma Gandhi was not awarded the Nobel P eace Prize but the 
coveted honour has gone to several individuals who believed in and propagated 
the Gandhian philosophy of peace and nonviolence gl obally. Barack Hussein 
Obama is latest in this club of Gandhian followers to have been awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize.  As demonstrated above, the firs t African American 
president of the United States has been an avid adm irer of Mahatma Gandhi. 
The Father of the nation Gandhi’s contribution and influence in the rise of 
Obama is being acknowledged too. 42  
U.S. President Barack Obama extends his nonviolent nation by personally 
advocating on the behalf of all political prisoners  in most countries, especially 
in Burma. He has been working towards the release o f Aung San Suu Kyi. 
However, saying that Gandhi was his hero and gettin g prizes are all very good, 
but Obama really needs to be more practical than th eoretical.  Gandhi, in 
contrast to Obama, never accepted public office – b ut accomplished so much! 
The presentation here on Gandhi’s influence on Obam a does not in any way 
mean we are canonising him. Many will obviously cri ticise his war theory. In an 
e-mail discussion with Professor Wahlrab Amentahru (Instructional Assistant 
Professor, Department of, Politics and Government, Illinois State University), 
he made a comment on this, by insisting that it’s n ot a problem to say that 
Obama was influenced by Gandhi.  He has talked abou t Gandhi enough for 
sure.  He has also been influenced by Martin Luther  King Jr. who was also 
influenced by Gandhi.  However, Obama has a tense r elationship with these 
pioneers of nonviolence because they would surely d isagree with his continued 
wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and they would oppose his  use of Drones to kill people 
in Pakistan, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and now the grea ter Middle East. Unless 
Obama turns away from this vice, he will not be pra ctically influenced by 
Gandhi.  
Below is a constructive criticism for Obama during his acceptance speech for 
the Nobel Peace Prize written by Michael Nagler 43  in the YES Magazine: Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 84 There were many noble thoughts resounding throughou t President 
Obama’s acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize . The 
knowledge he revealed of some of his great predeces sors, 
particularly Martin Luther King and Aung San Suu Ky i, was 
astounding for someone in his position; but then he  made a fatal 
mistake, and it is essential to recognize that mist ake and to 
correct it—to make sure that it does not happen aga in. Obama 
said, “A non-violent movement could not have halted  Hitler's 
armies.” He is wrong. In March of 1943, Gestapo headquarters in 
Berlin ordered the arrest and deportation of the re maining Jewish 
men who had been left out of the roundups so far be cause they 
were married to ‘Aryan’ wives. But then a totally u nexpected thing 
happened. First one, then another of those wives be gan to 
converge on the detention center on Rosenstrasse de manding their 
men be released. By the end of the weekend, they we re nearly 
6,000 strong and refusing orders to disperse though  Gestapo 
headquarters was only a few blocks away. And the Ge stapo caved 
in—they released the men. Moreover, as we have lear ned only 
recently, in Nazi-occupied capitals all over Europe , officials 
carefully watched the failed experiment and decided  to leave their 
own Jews who similarly had Aryan spouses alone. In other words, 
an unorganized form of nonviolence carried out spon taneously by 
untrained people with no organization and no follow -up “stopped 
Hitler’s armies” in their most virulent form, savin g tens of 
thousands of people. On one level, it should come a s a surprise 
that such a sophisticated president, who speaks kno wledgeably 
about King and Gandhi, should come out with the old est objection 
in the book, "it wouldn’t have worked against the N azis" — the 
most frequently heard cavil, the most knee-jerk rea ction that 
people like me, who advocate the "sweet reasonablen ess" of 
nonviolence, can hear in our sleep.  There are several problems 
with the logic of this apparently imperishable argu ment, but it will Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 85 do for now to simply say that it is patently false:  nonviolence did  
work against the Nazis—when it was tried. The issue  is not just 
philosophical.  
Other statements he used in his speech like “Negoti ations cannot convince Al 
Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms.” And “We mu st begin by acknowledging 
the hard truth that we will not eradicate violent c onflict in our lifetimes,” are 
really pure speculations! Again, Nagler hammers in the same article:  
President Obama displays more awareness of the nonv iolent 
alternative than anyone who has held that high offi ce in our 
lifetime. From what other President could we expect  to hear these 
words in a public speech: “As someone who stands he re as a direct 
consequence of Dr. King's life's work, I am living testimony to the 
moral force of non-violence. I know there is nothin g weak—nothing 
passive, nothing naïve—in the creed and lives of Ga ndhi and King.” 
And yet, as he follows out of this logic he runs in to a tragic block. 
He declares without evidence that nonviolence would  not have 
stopped Hitler’s armies and cannot stop a ruthless and determined 
opponent, although it stopped Ferdinand Marcos in 1 986, Slobodan 
Milosevic in 2000, and about a dozen other ruthless  dictators. He 
likewise bemoans the fact that when a Darfur or a R wanda 
happens we have only two choices, to stand by and d o nothing or 
to use deadly force, because “inaction tears at our  conscience and 
can lead to more costly intervention later. That is  why all 
responsible nations must embrace the role that mili taries with a 
clear mandate can play to keep the peace.” 
Nagler does not want to criticise Obama at such, hi s aim is to condemn the 
culture that has entrapped him, forcing him to betr ay his high intelligence. So 
Nagler wants to  alert every one of us to the dange r it poses—to encourage each 
of us to learn all we can about nonviolence and per sonally begin the shift, as 
Martin Luther King urged, from a ‘thing oriented’ c ivilization to one based on 
the infinite potential of the human being. No doubt  he concludes his article by Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 86 portraying that the election of Barack Obama to the  Presidency of the United 
States opened a door to a much brighter, nonviolent  future. We have to pluck 
up the courage to walk through that door before it closes once again. 
 
4.3.9. John Okwoeze Odey, the Gandhi Expert of Afri ca 
This icon is a catholic priest born in the Early 19 50s in Ngbo in Oha-Ukwu Local 
Government Area of Ebonyi State Nigeria. After his seminary formation in 
Augustines Senior Seminary Jos from 1977-1984, he w as ordained a priest on 
July 7, 1984. John Odey holds a doctorate degree in  Moral Theology from 
Academia Alfonsiana in Rome. He is a writer of many  books revolving around 
politics. His 37 th  book entitled “My life and my commitment” 44  is his 
autobiography in which this icon talked about himse lf. His numerous writings on 
the great nonviolent leaders Gandhi and Martin Luth er King Jr, coupled with his 
heated criticisms of the deploring political situat ion in his country ranks him a 
great nonviolent prophet of our time. His boldness and frankness towards 
authorities trying to bend the rules shows someone following the footsteps of 
Gandhi. This is a man who does not mince words as S tephen Elem would say to 
remind Nigerians (and I would add Africans) of thei r maladies:  
... corruption in both high and low places, poverty , indiscipline, 
hunger, underdevelopment, selection instead of elec tion, artificial 
fuel scarcity, abduction, strike, ethnic clashes, c ultism, 
examination malpractices, internet fraud, network p roblem, 
power outage, marginalisation bad roads, rigging of  election, 
injustice, jungle justice and the celebration of HI V/AIDS 45. 
I certainly agree with Elem’s conclusion to the abo ve article that it takes a man 
like Odey to stand up and fight for the rights of c itizens in a country where 
freedom of speech is not free. In effect Odey offer s constructive criticisms to 
the government to make the latter realise its short comings and improve. 
Eugene Song urged Africans and especially Camerooni ans to follow the example 
of this prominent figure who is a courageous and co mmitted man of God trying Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 87 to bring about changes in his country. He praised t he effort of Odey whom he 
identified as:  
…the vociferous and indefatigable Catholic Priest o f Abakiliki 
diocese…who challenges the vices that have crept in to the socio-
political and economic landscape of his country. He  feels Nigeria 
has been plunged into a pool of bribery and corrupt ion and 
something has do be done quickly so as to ransom th e 
situation…Fr. John Odey believes that criticizing t he vices ravaging 
the land must go beyond the pulpit. He holds that 
theologians/pastors should stand at the forefront l eading the 
people in the fight against injustices.46 
What motivated John Odey to be interested in Gandhi ’s nonviolence? He 
outlines it himself: 
Beginning from the year, 1979, when as a Seminarian , I first read 
some works of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King , I have 
continued to grow in the conviction that to fight a gainst social 
injustice is a compelling moral obligation. It is n ot enough to frown 
at social injustice and do nothing about its possib le elimination. 
More importantly, I have since then equally lived i n the conviction 
that nonviolent resistance provides the best soluti on to human 
conflicts. 47 
The unstable socio-political situation of Nigeria w as also a determining factor 
to opt for nonviolence:  
…the increasing incidents of violence in Nigeria, t he efforts of 
some Nigerians to counteract violence by disseminat ing the 
philosophy of peace and nonviolence, and my persona l interest in 
and conviction that nonviolent resistance is the be st and the most 
morally refined form of protest against social ills , combined 
motivated my choice… 48 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 88 Seeing that no serious study of the nature and mean ing of peace and 
nonviolence can afford to ignore the role of Mahatm a Gandhi, he hopes to 
throw more light to Nigerians ( and I will add to A fricans), who are interested in 
the nature, meaning and practice of nonviolent resi stance. John Odey is of the 
serious opinion that when those who can talk, choos e to remain silent in any 
situation, it is a great form of violence which he coined “violence of silence”. 
What does he mean by this? It is “the violence of t hose who are in the position 
to speak for the oppressed and whose voice could be  heard and hearkened to, 
but who have decided to keep quiet and watch the pr edators destroy the nation 
and the people. Like the violence of Pilate who was hed his hands after 
condemning Jesus, thinking that he had become innoc ent of his blood”  49. 
In his autobiography, Odey insists that the commitm ent to truth and justice is 
his like. In the last paragraph, he outlines the raison d’etre  of his mission as a 
prophet: 
Whether I am alive or dead, I will be glad if it is  said that 
somewhere, sometime and someday that as a Catholic priest, I did 
not shy away from playing my prophetic role, no mat ter how 
feeble, to save Nigeria when our leaders went on ra mpage in their 
blind pursuit of wealth and power at the expense of  the country 
and the people. If at the end of my earthly sojourn  a good number 
of people will honestly say that I struggled to liv e the good life, to 
give hope to the poor and the hopeless, to set the oppressed and 
the downtrodden free, to speak for those who are en slaved by our 
so-called leaders, to defend the defenceless, to be  the mouthpiece 
of those who have mouths but cannot speak, to open the eyes and 
minds of leaders blinded and distorted by the allur e of power and 
money and that I tried to make our leaders understa nd that all the 
money they steal from the nation and in the process  make life 
unbearable for millions for their fellow men and wo men have no 
value beyond the grave, I will pass on to the yonde r world a happy 
man in the hope that God’s grace will take care of my many Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 89 shortcomings. But before then, the commitment to tr uth and 
justice is my life 50  
 
4.3.10. Christian Cardinal Tumi:  Man of God, Vocif erous Prophet and True 
Patriot  
Born on 15 October 1930 in Kikaikelaki, North West Region of Cameroon, 
Cardinal Christian Wiyghan Tumi is the Emeritus Arc hbishop of Douala. He 
trained as a teacher in Nigeria and London, and the n went on to earn a 
licentiate in theology in Lyon and a doctorate in p hilosophy at the University of 
Fribourg, Switzerland. He was ordained a priest on 17 April 1966 in Soppo, 
diocese of Buea and from 1966 to 1967 he carried ou t his ministry as curate at 
Fiango (Kumbo). On 6 December 1979 he was elected t he first bishop of the 
diocese of Yagoua, erected the same day. He receive d Episcopal ordination on 
6 January 1980 in St. Peter's Basilica. On 23 April  1982, he was elected vice-
president of the Episcopal Conference of Cameroon, on 19 November 1982 he 
was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Garoua and on  17 March 1984 he was 
made Archbishop. In 1985 he was elected as presiden t of the National Episcopal 
Conference of Cameroon a position he held until 199 1. In 1990 he was President 
Delegate to the 8th General Assembly of the Synod o f Bishops. He became the 
Archbishop of Douala on 31 August 1991 and in 1994,  President Delegate to the 
Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops .  He was one of the cardinal 
electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclav e that selected Pope 
Benedict XVI.  
Cardinal Tumi is one of the rare prelates to public ly denounce the political 
situation of Cameroon where so many of his kind see m to be silent! As a priest 
of God, he clamours for justice and peace and fight s for the human rights of his 
compatriots 51 . His public pronouncements have led people think t hat he is 
interested in taking over the presidency of the cou ntry. There is an impression 
in the political world of Cameroon that pastors hav e always been silent or 
indifferent to the political situation. Eugene Song  corrects this impression when Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 90 he says: “It will be a gross understatement to clai m here that pastors of 
Cameroon have been wholly silent in the face of inc reasing corruption and 
injustices prevalent in the country” 52 . To add more flesh to this proposal, 
Eugene Song continues: “A prominent Cameroonian Sta tesman and a true 
patriot who has never been silent in the face of in justices and oppression in 
Cameroon is Christian Cardinal Tumi, Archbishop eme ritus of Douala” 53 . Tumi’s 
time bomb exploded when he published a book entitle d “ The political regimes 
of Ahmadou Ahhidjo and Paul Biya, and Christian Tum i, priest ”. The effect of 
this book could be seen during the lunching. Irenea us Chia Chongwain depicted 
well the scenario during the lunching.  
It is understood when sports in general and footbal l in particular, 
draw huge crowds in  Cameroon, but when the launchi ng of a book 
releases a human avalanche to the event, it can onl y be put down 
as the exception to every rule. That was the case o n Tuesday, 
April 17, when a healthy portion of the Yaounde pop ulation 
trooped to the Djeuga Palace Hotel to witness the l aunching of 
Cardinal Tumi's latest publication… The book chroni cles the past 
and present regimes governance excesses, their obse ssion for 
power and the mechanisms used to keep a tight rein on dissenting 
voices and remote-control the citizenry. One indisp utable 
conclusion cuts across the book the obsession for p ower breeds 
limitations in judgment 54 . 
Tumi in this book exposes in clear terms his experi ence with political leaders of 
both the Ahhidjo and Biya regimes. In it he also re lates the plots and threats of 
his life. Some people prefer to call this book Card inal Tumi’s Autobiography 
because he gives experience of his life. He has alw ays loved to fight against 
corruption.  
Just like Gandhi, Tumi opines for freedom of everyo ne. Therefore, the Catholic 
Church firmly believes in religious freedom for eve ry human being. That is 
every man’s inalienable right. The Church must prom ote the right of every 
individual and community to social and civil freedo m in matters of religion. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 91 Such freedom is willed by the Creator of all things . It is therefore embedded in 
every man’s nature and should not be curtailed by a nyone whosoever. Any 
coercion in religious matters must be avoided. Quot ing the Compendium of the 
Social Doctrine of the Church  (num. 155), he insists that all men should be 
immune from coercion on the part of individuals, so cial groups and every 
human power so that, within due limits, nobody is f orced to act against his 
convictions in religious matters in private or in p ublic, alone or in association 
with others.  This freedom is the power that the wi ll possesses to determine for 
itself and by itself to act or not to act, without being forced by any external or 
internal force 55 . The cardinal was by this, reacting to a situation  in the north in 
which non-Moslems of the North of Cameroon believed  they could get work with 
the government if they become Moslems; or at least,  bear Moslem names.  The 
cardinal never minced words to insist: “That is a m oral pressure that violates 
the individual’s freedom to choose a moral pressure  that violates the 
individual’s freedom to choose in conscience his ow n religion. It is even anti-
constitutional”56 . 
When the Lamibe in Garoua wanted to oblige Christia ns to pay the Zaka, a sort 
of tax Moslems pay to their religious chiefs, it wa s Tumi who sent a letter to all 
Christian communities telling them that they had no  obligation to pay the said 
tax.  
In his exercise of function as the President of the  National Episcopal Conference 
of Cameroon, the Bishops reacted to the economic cr ises in Cameroon in 1990 
recognizing the external causes of it but insisted on causes for which Cameroon 
was responsible. The government reacted bitterly. A s a result this was said of 
Tumi: “He has become by this fact, the pet hate of the regime!” 57 . Despite 
this, he never relented in his duties in forming pe ople’s consciences. 
The Cardinal has always been a precursor of the rig ht formation of conscience 
“…the formation of the conscience is vital for the Human person” 58 . His stand 
on issues touching the political life of the countr y led some to think that the 
Cardinal was against Biya. The Cardinal’s statement : “you can be against Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 92 someone’s political thoughts and still love him”59  is in line with Gandhi’s 
thoughts. 
Like Gandhi, Cardinal Tumi has always been an advoc ate of Justice. In the 
concluding pages of his book he invites all to refl ect on justice:  
I believe there are many people in our society who have been 
gravely hurt by all forms of injustice: the injusti ce of parents 
towards their children-not sending a child to schoo l is unjust; 
injustice towards workers-workers deserve a just wa ge…in the 
absence of justice, nothing good can be expected fr om the 
citizens. It would be asking them for the impossibl e. This is the 
time to say loud and clear certain things, which co uld shock some 
who refuse to leave the already beaten path. Once l eaders of a 
nation raise injustice into an instrument of govern ment rule, the 
people and all men and women of good-will, who arde ntly yearn 
for peace, must not fold their arms. Otherwise, thr ough their 
silence, they become accomplices to injustice 60 .  
In effect, Tumi is giving us a lesson great nonviol ence leaders including Jesus 
have already given. We must not remain silent in th e face of injustice. Cardinal 
Tumi is as Eugene Song insists “A glaring example o f a vociferous prophet and a 
critical pastor of the regime in Cameroon” 61 .   
From his words, we can deduce that Tumi is a harbin ger of truth he thinks it is 
a virtue which politicians, in general, and in espe cially Cameroonian politicians 
lack:  
The Cameroonian politician does not like the truth.  He refuses to 
objectively analyse the opinion of the other person  for fear that 
the other person might be right. Truth is the light  that exposes 
everything; it resists all attempts to cover it up because what we 
strive to cover it with is called a lie. The man wh o lies goes against 
his sacred nature… I, insist on the love of the tru th because I 
believe that is what Cameroonian politicians lack. Truth does not 
call for any defence because it is already by its v ery nature strong, Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 93 and it can never be defeated. It is only swindling and lie-telling 
that have no force before the truth, that need arms , soldiers and 
prisons to prolong their domination. A partial gove rnment digs its 
own grave. What is most important in the life of a politician, in the 
true sense of the word, is to free the heart and th e mind from the 
fear of truth because it is a grave sin to give in to the evil of lies. 
He who is afraid has something to hide; that is obv ious 62. 
With this, Tumi brings to the contemporary world a message of nonviolence 
which should be the option of all the prelates.  
If nonviolence has been so effective, it can be app lied to the African 
democracy.  As late as the end of the sixties, the West African nationalist 
pioneer, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe wrote in the light of h is own experience: “On 
Gandhi’s teachings of satyagraha, history has prove d Gandhi right…” And we 
can add that Gandhi will continue to be proven righ t in Africa. 63  In other words, 
Africa needs Gandhi.

CHAPTER FIVE 
 
5.0. AFRICA NEEDS GANDHI!  1 
It is the desire of any rational being to live in a  good and sound social and 
political system. For harmony and peace to reign in  any country, it must be 
governed by competent leaders in a good political s ystem. All through history, 
think-tanks have sought to formulate social and pol itical theories and systems 
most fit for any country. While Plato and Aristotle  had a pejorative view of 
democracy, and viewed it as a system of rule by the  masses at the expense of 
wisdom, it is clear that our contemporary era in co ntrast with the ancient 
period has opted for democracy as the ideal politic al system. In this chapter, 
we will analyse the democracy in Africa and make al lusions to Gandhi in order 
to propose some solutions to the African political problem.  
Before delving into the core of this chapter, some pertinent questions run 
through the mind of any rational being: Why is demo cracy which seems to be a 
widely accepted political system so problematic for  Africans? Can Gandhi in this 
contemporary era meddle into state affairs here in Africa in order to shape its 
democracy? This chapter attempts to unveil our mind s of the above queries in 
four stages. We will first of all succinctly define  democracy and its general 
understanding, Secondly; we will try to make a herm eneutics of the problem 
with democracy in Africa. Thirdly, we shall navigat e succinctly into the 
Cameroonian democracy. With the problem exposed, we  will in the fourth stage 
of the essay make recourse to Gandhi’s vision of De mocracy to support the 
efforts of installing true democracy in Africa, esp ecially in Cameroon. But what 
is this democracy all about? 
 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 100 5.1. Towards Defining Democracy 
Democracy is derived from the Greek word Kratos , meaning power or rule and 
Demo  referring to “the people”. Democracy thus means “r ule by the people”. 
The problem with defining democracy is that it seem s to have no agreed 
meaning. It can mean anything to anyone and therefo re risks having no meaning 
at all. Some see democracy as the most promiscuous word in the world of 
public affairs. North Korea is a “democracy” – and its official name is the 
Democratic Peoples’ Republic of Korea. Libya practi ses its form of democracy. 
Uganda, under the single party rule when political parties were banned was 
also a democracy; today, it is a democracy as well.  Robert Mugabe has regularly 
held elections in Zimbabwe for the past years, a st andard democratic practice 
but we are still to hope for a true democracy there .  2 Democracy seems to 
sound right and good, even the most authoritarian t yrant would wish to 
associate with it. As shown above, in ancient Greec e, democracy tended to be 
viewed in negative terms. Well into the 19th centur y, the term continued to 
have a pejorative connotation, suggesting a system of “mob rule”. Now, 
suddenly, we are all “democrats”. Indeed, as the ma jor ideological systems 
have faltered and collapsed in the late 20th centur y, the flame of democracy 
has appeared to burn yet more strongly. One can thu s insist that:  
The most important development of the past century has been 
both.....simple and profound. It has been the sprea d of 
democracy.  Democracy hardly makes the world perfec t, but it 
tends to engender open economies and more respect f or human 
rights. Ultimately, democracy promises to make the world more 
peaceful, for democracies are less likely to go to war against 
each other than are totalitarian regimes. 3 
Today, the classical definition of democracy is fou nd in Abraham Lincoln’s 
words: “The government of the people, by the people  and for the people”. 
It has not really been easy for African countries t o practice democracy. When 
asked what he thought of elections in Africa, Fela Anikulapu Kuti quickly fumed Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 101 “Democrazy? Dem all crazy, what a crazy demonstratio n !” 4 This will be 
demonstrated in the succinct presentation of the de mocratic situation of some 
African Countries. 
 
5.2. The political situation in some African nation s  
During the first three decades of post independence  (1960 - 1990), most of the 
African states experimented variations between auth oritarian rule and 
liberalisation. It was hard to find a political par ty using the reference to multi-
party system. The perspective from 1990 was shaped by two different facts 
which occur simultaneously. The first is the claim for ‘’full’’ democracy, 
including multi-party system and human rights. The second consists in the 
extension of this project all over the continent. T he exceptions are countries 
involved in “old” democratisation experiences (Sene gal, Botswana, 
Zimbabwe...) or affected by civil war (Sudan, Liber ia ...) 
In Africa, the debate on liberal democracy was poor  before 1990. There were 
many dictators like Mobutu Sese Seko of DR Congo an d Mengistu Haile Mariam 
of Ethiopia. Different versions of “africanized” de mocracy existed in 
experiences tested by leaders like Nyerere or Kaund a. Some other regimes 
defined themselves after the Marxist notion of “pop ular democracy’’ as in 
Benin or Congo-Brazzaville. However, the references  to the rule of majority, to 
the existence of a legal opposition, to more than o ne party or to free elections 
were unknown out of the circle of intellectual elit e. These notions were not 
part of local political cultures.  
The high point of African democracy was doubtlessly  reached on the 27 th  of 
April 1994 when South Africans trooped to the polls  to elect a government led 
by Nelson Mandela in the country’s first democratic  elections. In fact, a decade 
ago, it seemed democracy in Africa would have a bri ght future. Tyrannies in 
Benin, Ethiopia, Liberia, DR Congo, Congo Brazzavil le, Ivory Coast and Mali had 
been ousted and many more were under threat.  Oppos ition activists in 
Francophone Africa organised national conferences h olding leaders to account Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 102 on claims of corruption and brutality. Pro-democrac y activists in Ghana and 
Nigeria stepped up their campaigns. Nowadays, it se ems clear democracy has 
not come to stay in Africa. The reason is clear: In cumbents have become adept 
at winning polls: doctoring voters’ rolls; stuffing  ballot boxes and using violence 
against opponents. Has democracy succeeded or faile d? Can we say that the 
democracy glass is at least ‘half full’? It is clea r that there have been outright 
successes thanks to the efforts of opposition parti es, quest for press freedom 
and above all, the presence of election observers. There have equally been 
many setbacks. A few countries will be taken as cas e studies here for better 
understanding of how bad leadership and dirty polit ics under the canopy of 
democracy have done a great blow on the African con tinent and is still doing.  
 
5.2.1. Uganda 
 In Uganda on the 25th of January 1971, Idi Amin ov erthrew the government of 
Milton Obote and became president through a very bl oody coup d´etat . He 
formed a squad with whom he carried out his brutali ty on the innocent Ugandan 
citizens.  Killing for him was a hobby. He ruthless ly killed the Archbishop of 
Luwun. He heartlessly massacred and humiliated peop le. It is on record that 
within three months of assuming power, he massacred  ten thousand people. In 
two years it was about eighty thousand and after ei ght years the figure reached 
three hundred thousand. He ruined Uganda and later on fled into exile. Thank 
God that today, there is apparent peace. Neverthele ss, much has to be done to 
checkmate the present democratic government.   
 
5.2.2. South Africa 
Back in South Africa, Apartheid ravaged the black r ace seriously till the early 
1990s. They were discriminated against by the white  people who saw 
themselves as having the full political right. It r eached a stage where, black 
people were forced to live away from white people, to go to separate schools, 
not to intermarry, etc. defaulters were maltreated subjected to torture and Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 103 even killed. This was the case with Nelson Mandela who suffered imprisonment 
for 27 years! 
 
5.2.3. Chad 
Tension interspersed with bloodletting has been the  norm in Eastern Chad for 
the past years, and policymakers most often view th e crisis in Eastern Chad 
through a Darfur lens. Consequently, conflict resol ution efforts have thus far 
focused principally on the tensions between N’Djame na and Khartoum. It is 
believed that Chad is fuelled by weapons and suppor t from an external patron. 
The rebellion in Chad is the latest chapter in a de cades-long internal power 
struggle. Chadian rebels’ lightning strike on the c apital N’Djamena in late 
January and early February of the year 2008 is one of the most dramatic 
consequences of two combustible situations that rem ain on collision course. 
The first is the continuous tragedy in neighbouring  Darfur and the support for 
Chadian rebel groups by the government of Sudan, to  topple the Chadian 
President Idriss Deby. The second combustible situa tion is the internal political 
crisis of Chad. Despite the Chadian government’s as sertions that all of Chad’s 
problems emanate from Sudan’s capital Khartoum, Cha d’s government is among 
the world’s most venal and its citizens are among t he world’s most destitute 
and disenfranchised.  
Chad provides an accommodating theatre for regional  conflict and proxy war 
because it is grappling with its own very serious i nternal crisis. In the wake of 
the most recent coup attempt, the Chadian governmen t has cracked down hard 
on the unarmed political opposition. Some oppositio n leaders have been 
arrested, some have fled to neighbouring countries,  while others have been 
driven underground. Refugees from Chad fleeing from  the situation fill the 
neighbouring countries like Cameroon and Central Af rica. Chadian politics for 
the last 40 years have become synonymous with viole nce, political 
assassinations, military intimidations, insecurity,  etc. 
 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 104 5.2.3. Democratic Republic of Congo  
In Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the  former president Mobotu 
Sese Seko held a military rule for 32 years. “32 ye ars of Terrorism”. According 
to John Odey, Mobutu ruled as a megalomaniac and as  a kleptomaniac. He 
ruled his people from the throne and from the bunke rs through the brutality of 
his mercenaries. He embezzled the country’s funds. According to the IMF in 
1984 and the US treasury, Mobutu’s personal money h ad risen to the tune of 4 
billion dollars. Mobutu died leaving behind an inst itutionalised kleptocracy, 
corruption, violence, a senseless plunder of a nati on’s resources and the 
impoverishment of the country and everyone in it. 5 Under the regime of the 
young Joseph Kabila, one would expect a messianic c hange. However, the 
situation in the Goma region of Congo, which occupi es a special place in 
international news, is an eyesore.There is an urgen t need as Professor Ka Mana 
will put it for Congo to invent a new Independence.    
 
5.2.4. Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) 
We were about praising Ivory Coast in a few lines a bove but ever since the last 
elections this December 2010 the stories have been gradually changing. A 
decade ago, Ivory Coast was seen as a haven of peac e and prosperity in West 
Africa.  This country however had internal divisions accordi ng to ethnic, 
religious and economic lines. Because of the Cocoa people from neigbouting 
countries fluxed in to earn their living and they s tayed mostly in the North. 
Because of this some Ivorians portrayed northerners  as not being real Ivorians. 
Ivory Coast has been called a Country of Two Presidents. On the one hand we 
have Laurent Gbagbo: 65-year-old former history tea cher, southern Christian; 
president since 2000; backed by security forces. An d on the other hand, we 
have Alassane Ouattara: 68-year-old economist, nort hern Muslim; prime 
minister 1990-1993; backed by former rebels, UN, Af rican leaders and the 
West. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 105 The Independent Electorial Commision declared Ouatt ara winner and almost 
silmultaneously, the Court declared the incumbent p resident Gbagbo winner. 
Here are the results after the elections: 
• Constitutional Council: Laurent Gbagbo 51%, Alass ane Ouattara 49%, 
annulled results in seven northern regions 
• Electoral Commission: Laurent Gbagbo 46%, Alassan e Ouattara 54%True 
enough, The Ivorian IEC was not supposed to publish  the results of the election 
as stipulated by the Ivorian law. Nevertheless, tha t does not mean the results 
she published were fraudulent. May be the IEC antic ipated the results for fear 
it would be edited and the results given to the peo ple would not be their 
choice. The Constitutional Council, headed by a Gba gbo ally, annulled the 
votes from the north, leaving Mr Gbagbo with a slen der overall majority. The 
UN observer mission says that there was violence in  parts of the north, as well 
as in Mr Gbagbo's home region in the west, but that  overall, the vote was 
democratic and peaceful. 
Did Gbagbo actually win the elections therefore? To  whom do we give 
credibility: Gbagbo or Ouatara? The main question i s this: was the vote in the 
north free and fair? People are loosing their lives , homes and country because 
two old men in their sixties, nearing 70 cannot and  do not want to doff their 
caps to each other. We have an impression that some  of the international 
bodies supporting either of the parties do so not o nly for peace sake, but to 
support their private interests. The only way forwa rd for Ivory Coast is Peaceful 
Dialogue between the two parties. Thousand of natio nal and international bans 
will not solve the issue. If force is applied, to r emove one of the parties, the 
country will continue to wallow in a situation of u nrest. Real peace must come 
through Dialogue in a Nonviolent atmostphere.  
 
5.2.5. Sudan 
The political situation in Sudan cannot be left out . After a 21-year war in the 
south, the Sudanese government and the Sudan People ’s Liberation Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 106 Movement/Army (SPLM/A) hoped for a peaceful situati on only to see a new war 
erupting in Darfur in February 2003 after years of skirmishes over land and 
water between ethnic groups that identify themselve s mainly as “African” or 
“Arab”. The two main rebel groups, the Sudan Libera tion Army (SLA) and the 
Justice and Equality Movement, accused the central government in Khartoum of 
supporting Arab pastoralists in their disputes with  African farmers. Most 
observers have blamed the Sudanese armed forces and  a pro-government 
militia, known as the Janjaweed , for most of the atrocities in the war, 
including killing and raping civilians and destroyi ng homes, wells and crops. The 
situation in Sudan has been described as “A complex  conflict which brings 
mixed responses.”6 Unlike Southern Sudan where the majority are Chris tians, 
almost all the people of Darfur are Muslims. This i s one of the reasons why 
Darfur conflict is arguably more complex. No doubt,  Alfred Taban comments: 
“followers of the same faith living in the same reg ion are fighting each other 
over resources, and ‘outsiders’- including northern -based Islamist opposition 
groups, the government and SPLM/A-are either giving  tacit or open support to 
one faction or another.”7 Crime has always been a problem in Darfur but it h as 
increasingly taken on political overtones with gove rnment vehicles being 
hijacked or businessmen associated with the governm ent being targeted for 
attack. On a more general note, Sudan has suddenly become a land akin with 
moving corpses, kwashiorkor children, children sold iers, hunger, sickness and 
all forms of political unrest. 
 
5.2.6. Central African Republic 
 In a continent beset with bloody conflicts often t riggering banner headlines, 
the Central African Republic (CAR), located in an u nstable triangle bordering 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Southern Suda n and Chad, is a silent 
crisis crying out for increased international donor  support and media attention. 
In March 2003, with the world’s eyes riveted on Ira q, CAR suffered another 
political unrest in a long history of coups and upr isings when General Bozize led 
an army of insurgents to topple elected President A nge-Felix Patasse. The Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 107 situation in CAR remains fragile and volatile. In s pite of its economic potential - 
rich in timber, gold, diamonds and uranium. The Cen tral African Republic (CAR) 
is one of the least known countries in Africa and t he world. Because of its 
relative obscurity, it is often overshadowed by its  better-known neighbours 
such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Su dan. Recently, however, 
internal conflicts stemming from its historical pas t and its present realities, as 
well as the spill over of political unrest and viol ence from Sudan and Chad, 
have given the CAR more prominence on the internati onal map. 8 
 
5.2.7. Zimbabwe 
The situation in Zimbabwe is a pitiable one because : 
The popularity of opposition parties and the unpopu larity of the 
incumbent regime do not guarantee political change.  
Zimbabwe’s opposition Movement for Democratic Chang e (MDC) 
party, widely reckoned to have won two much-critici sed 
elections against President Robert Mugabe’s Zanu-PF  party, 
languishes in opposition without effective regional  or 
international backing. 9 
This situation persists till this present date. It is hard to listen to any news 
focussing on the African situation without any ment ion of Zimbabwe. The 
population of Harare is victim of terrible economic  crises and is turning more 
and more towards religion. They are much monitored by Mugabe’s regime. He 
has always sought to corrupt even religious leaders . The Baptist pastor 
Raymond Motsi and the Catholic Bishop Emeritus of B ukwayo Mgr Pius Naibe 
have “paid it hot” for challenging Mugabe’s regime.10  The country is presently 
undergoing a high rate of political unrest coupled with its almost crumbling 
economic situation. 
 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 108 5.2.8. Cameroon  
In the Republic of Cameroon, we are living in a sys tem where leadership seems 
to be stagnant and reserved for some privileged few . Cameroonians are said to 
be practising democracy with many political parties  (multi-partism) like the 
Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM) which happens to be the 
ruling party and the Social Democratic Front (SDF) the main opposition party 
among many others. We see democracy as a common den ominator while 
paradoxically speaking, ever since independence in 1960, Cameroonians have 
experienced just two presidents, Ahmadou Alhidjo an d Paul Biya. The latter 
will be celebrate on the 6 th  of November 2010 his 28th  anniversary as the 
president of Cameroon and has done all in his capac ity to modify the 
constitutions and remain forever as an everlasting monarch in ‘democratic 
Cameroon’.  
It is true that there are no civil wars in Cameroon ; neither do we have frequent 
strikes like in other African countries.  There is ‘apparent peace’. The peaceful 
atmosphere in Cameroon was polluted by violent demo nstrations and riots in 
the month of February 2008. These riots paralyzed Y aoundé, Cameroon’s 
capital, and Douala, the economic capital and a maj or port city, as popular 
anger exploded over high fuel and food prices and a  move by President Paul 
Biya to extend his rule.11 As if to flare up anger, Cameroonians were named 
“apprentice sorcerers” by the president during his speech and military men 
filled the streets, leading to destruction of life and property. The ruling party 
used the pretext to say that opposition parties whe re at the base of all these 
rioting. During the strike, TV stations and Radio s tations like Equinox TV  and 
Magic FM Radio Station  who dared to speak were banned with the accusation  of 
not meeting up to the current standards.  
Many artists who sang anything against the Governme nt tasted the koboko  (a 
Yoruba word which means whip) and still taste it no w. This is the case of the 
great musician LAPIRO who sang against the change o f the constitution. He was 
thrown into prison with the charges of “inciting vi olence, simple rebellion and 
extortion of funds”. The musician himself feels tha t “the CPDM is at the bay Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 109 and is bent on reducing to silence all those who op posed this catastrophic 
project ‘constitution change.’” 12 In his last album, “ Constitution Constipée ” 
(Constipated Constitution) he denounced the project  of Biya to change the 
constitution and accused him of trying to remain in  power despite his old age.  
The political agendum in Cameroon as seen by most A nglophones is increasingly 
dominated by what is known as the ‘Anglophone probl em’, which poses a major 
challenge to the efforts of the post-colonial state  to forge national unity and 
integration, and has led to the reintroduction of f orceful arguments and actions 
in favour of ‘federalism’ or even ‘secession’. Some  Anglophones especially in 
Bamenda felt ‘neglected’ by the president who had n ot visited them for almost 
20 years. Hopes of Anglophones were uplifted with t he recent visit of Biya to 
Bamenda. It is the first time in about 20 years tha t Paul Biya comes to Bamenda 
after the visit of 9th February 1983, the 1984 agro  pastoral show, March 1985 
and in 1991 during the operation ghost town. 
Between 1991 and 2010, the distance between the Pre sident and the people of 
the North West was ‘widened’ but recently it has al so been reduced and with 
time it will become better. To the people of the No rthwest Region, the 
President announced the creation of the University of Bamenda, the pursuit of 
negotiations to finance the Ring Road, and the cons truction of a thermal energy 
plant in Bamenda. He equally announced studies for the creation of referral 
hospital in Bamenda and the long-run option of cons tructing a hydroelectric 
plant on the Menchum Falls. We are waiting in hope for the day this will be 
realized. Action as we say speak louder than words.   
What made the visit so interesting was the encounte r with the chief opposition 
party SDF, in the person of Ni John Fru Ndi. Accord ing to the latter, it was a 
time of Dialogue. In an interview granted to The Po st he showed that Dialogue 
was going to be the answer for a better Cameroon. “ But the good news is that 
we finally met and we started dialoguing and by the  time we rounded up we 
agreed that we will continue with the dialogue beca use we realised that 
information was not flowing between the two of us. May be there was a 
blockage somewhere” (http://www.thepostwebedition.c om). This discussion Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 110 was the first time since the historic return of mul tipartism on the 19th of 
December 1990. Biya received Fru Ndi on the 10th of  December. This is very 
symbollic as this is the day which commemorates the  Declaration of Universal 
Human Rights. 
Cameroon just celebrated 50 years of Unity, Stabili ty and Peace. Is there really 
peace? Is everyone in Cameroon really happy? These are unanswered questions 
to tickle our medulla oblongata. 
 
5.2.9. Nigeria 
Nigeria like any other African country is also conc erned with the need of having 
a good and sound political system. It was therefore  all jubilation when Nigeria 
finally adopted democracy in 1999. Nigeria has had a long tortured history of 
dancing around democracy but never quite getting it  right. With the second 
coming of President Obasanjo, it looked like the di vidends of a true democracy 
had come to stay. But so far, what have been the di vidends of this democracy? 
Before delving into this, we shall in a few words a nalyse the political situation 
of Nigeria before and after May 1999. Our aim will not be to sing litanies of 
praises, for “when a hunter is praised, he kills hi s own dog”. We will show that 
in as much as there are positive points in democrac y so far, there is still much 
to be desired. 
Without any intention of presenting a chronology of  activities we may begin by 
saying that Nigeria is among the African countries that have suffered from great 
political mishaps such as slavery, colonialism, the  menace of the pathetic 
Nigeria-Biafra war, and is still suffering from the  phenomenon of Neo-
colonialism. Far back in 1979, Obasanjo made a reco rd of returning the federal 
government to civilian rule. However this “messiani sm” did not last long. There 
was another attempt to return to civilian rule in 1 993 under Babangida which 
became Abortive. He was forced to hand over to Erne st Shonekan whom Abacha 
was to overthrow. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 111 Nigeria for a long period has been under the pangs of military rule which many 
would agree was a very tragic period. The military rulers had a growing affinity 
to violence, injustice and in most cases as Onyeoch a would put it: “terrorised 
their people with arbitrary laws…those who succeede d them have invariably 
had to resolve to the case of force.”13  Under the military regime, not only were 
the rulers dictators, the people had little or no s ay in the government. People 
lived in fear and the future remained always blurre d. There were many political 
killings and brutality of Heroes like Alfred Rewane  (An icon of Nigeria's pro-
democracy movement during the dark days of the late r dictator General Sani 
Abacha. He campaigned tirelessly democracy and huma n rights, true 
federalism, honesty, transparency and accountabilit y in public office, and 
ethics in business. His murder on October 6, 1995 i n suspicious circumstance 
provoked national and international outcry.), Alhaj i Moshood Abiola (who won 
the elections that were annulled on June 12 1993), Ken Sarowiwa (Born on 
October 10, 1941, he is of the Ogoni People of Nige ria. At the peak of his non-
violent campaign he was arrested, hastily tried by a special military tribunal, 
and hanged in November 10, 1995), etc. The authorit ies grafted corruption as 
the modus vivendi  of any Nigerian. Schools were seized by the govern ment.  
The Church resorted to prayers like “A Prayer for N igeria in Distress”, “A Prayer 
against bribery and corruption in Nigeria”. Everyon e hoped for a hay day, for a 
political leader - A Moses who would lead Nigeria t o her promised land. As if 
heaven answered our prayers, there was finally a ch ange. In effect, a new 
course seemed to have been mapped out with the deat h in June 1998 of former 
military dictator, Sani Abacha, and the subsequent reforms of General Abdul 
Salaam Abubakar. Nigeria was therefore led into the  promised land of 
DEMOCRACY under the distinguished leadership of Chi ef Olusegun Obasanjo. 
Nigerians and other citizens of foreign countries w ere very happy with the forth 
coming of Obasanjo. Hopes were very high. People ex pected a better situation 
under the democratic government. No wonder, Obasanj o did wet the appetite 
of many with his “rhetoretical inaugural speech” ma de on the 29 th  of May 1999. 
We are still waiting to see the results of his spee ch. He began by accusing the Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 112 former governments of so many atrocities, and from there made so many 
promises. The ‘dividends’ of his democracy are clea r. Elections are not only 
rigged, but conducted under bloodshed and violent c onditions. John Odey did 
not waste time to say “ This Madness Called 2003 Elections ”. Despite Obasanjo’s 
condemnation of violence as “an ill-wind that blows  no one any good” 15 , the 
elections that took place a few months later did no t reflect this. Despite the 
fact that a few years ago, Nigeria, the giant of Af rica, became crippled by 
corrupt, aimless and inept military dictatorship, J ohn Odey still insist that we 
have not reaped positive dividends from the democra cy under Obasanjo. This is 
because today, and for eight years at a stretch, Ni geria “has been suffering 
under the heavy yoke of President Obasanjo’ democra tic tyranny, moral 
insensitivity and executive rascality.”16  In a nutshell what we are trying to bring 
out here is that: “when President Obasanjo took ove r the leadership of the 
country in May 1999, we thought that he had come to  put things in order. We 
have ever since then discovered how mistaken we hav e been…” 17   
Professor Onyeocha, reflecting on the political sit uation of Nigeria presents to 
us these striking words:  
Nigerian politics is one of acrimony, dissension, d ivision, 
sectionalism, and political sleight of hand…Nigeria n politics has 
as its permanent feature, the unwholesome and unsav oury 
epilogue of vitiation and vilification for anyone w ho ever dared 
to participate in it….It is quite an interesting sp eculative 
question whether at all it is possible to foster de mocratic 
principles in Nigeria. 18  
Interestingly, Onyeocha does not end in woes he ins ists on a more positive note 
that:“ Nigeria is our country….We must tidy it up a nd clean up whatever mess 
there is…Our situation is not hopeless but hopeful. ” 19  On this positive note, we 
praise the efforts of the new president of Nigeria so far. Nevertheless, we will 
not go deep into analysing the situation now. We gi ve him enough time to see 
to the workability of his strategies. What actually  prevents Africans from 
reaping the positive dividends of democracy? Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 113  
5.3. The Problems with African Democracy 
If after almost an average of 40 years of Independe nce in many African Nations, 
we cannot boast of sufficient dividends of governan ce, then there is something 
wrong. One of the characteristics of Democracy is t he capacity to change 
leaders after a certain period of time. It is worth y to note that in Africa, most 
countries practicing democracy do not meet up to th e standards required. 
Presidents in Democratic regimes remain on seat for  many decades, for 
example, Paul Biya of Cameroon, Mugabe of Zimbabwe,  Gadafi of Libya, Dos 
Santos of Angola, Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guine a etc. African countries 
have been turned into political states where those who cry for justice are 
arrested, detained, tortured, imprisoned and even k illed, but yet claim that 
these countries are oases of freedom. The following  can be outlined as 
problems with our African democracy.  
 
5.3.1. Bad Leadership  
African leaders seek always their personal interest s; their eyes are always on 
the material things of life, on opportunism, on wha t can be taken from the 
proverbial “national cake” 20 . This is a general sickness of African leaders. 
Billions of African dollars are daily being moved i nto private accounts overseas 
by African leaders to feed the already overflowing economies of the West. In 
effect, for democracy to succeed, we must take a se cond look at our leadership 
formation and succession processes. In the past yea rs, we have been rendered 
miserable, hopeless and have fallen from grace to g rass because of corrupt 
leadership.  21   
 
5.3.2. Corruption 
CORRUPTION is a canker worm which eats deep into ou r politics. Commenting 
on the situation in Nigeria, John Odey insists:  Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 114 today in Nigeria, corruption has become a structura l sin so 
contagious that it hardly leaves anybody without a smear. And 
since the country was justifiably stigmatized as a den of 
corruption, all Nigerians, both the guilty and the innocent, have 
been paying very costly for it. Everywhere in the w orld, 
Nigerians are generally feared like mad dogs, dread ed like 
criminals, cautiously approached like dangerous sna kes and 
watchfully avoided like lepers.  22   
Cameroon keeps on ranking year in, year out as the world’s most corrupt 
country. When one listens to international news on Africa, one notices that 
corruption remains at the base of our dwindling dem ocracy in Africa. 
 
5.3.3. Economic fragility 
The biggest obstacle to Africa’s democratisation is  its economic fragility. On 
this note, the former secretary-general of the Orga nisation of African Unity 
(OAU), Dr. Salim Ahmed remarked: “Political reform cannot raise the world 
prices for Africa’s commodities.”23 Spoils of office are always being shared 
between members of the same elite wearing different  political colours. In 
effect, the situation has reached a level where eco nomic uncertainties chip 
away at idealism and new style regimes find it easi er to co-opt and corrupt 
rather that to bludgeon their opponents. 
 
5.3.4. Neglect of the Children, the Aged and the In firm.  
Njoku Francis, in the opening pages of his work Philosophy in Politics Law and 
Democracy (Owerri: Claretian Institute of Philosophy, 2002) d wells on Hubert 
Humphrey’s famous statement as a litmus test for a true government. The 
latter insists that the moral test for government i s how it treats those who are 
in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in  the twilight of life the aged; 
and those who are in the shadow of life, the sick, the needy and the 
handicapped. The pitiable condition is that the chi ldren are not sure of their Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 115 future. Some cannot go to school because of the hig h prices needed for good 
education. Children suffer the effects of child tra fficking daily. The lack of 
proper care of children leads to juvenile delinquen cy and stagnancy of future 
progress. What then is the essence of the so-called  children’s day? The aged 
and infirm are simply at the mercy of their family members. There is need for 
proper amenities. Most old and sick people take to begging and this becomes an 
eyesore for the Africa and for Cameroon in particul ar.  
Seeing the few points above and many more, it is al most a consensus that most 
African countries have not yet achieved the require d democracy. On this note, 
John Odey was bold enough to affirm that “Democracy  is an illusion not a 
reality in Nigeria.”24  We can modify this by saying that, democracy remai ns an 
illusion in most African Nations.   
It is not our wish to remain only on woes. The inte ntion here is to propose a 
solution, a proposal which will seriously help the African to see more positive 
dividends of Democracy. At this juncture, we look u p to what Gandhi has to 
offer. 
 
5.4. Any hope from Gandhi? 
Gandhi (1869-1948) gave the world a simple message,  though held no political 
office.  A lean, frail, ‘half-naked fakir’, It was just the moral grandeur of his 
soul which enabled him to fight against brute power , in any form. No doubt, 
Einstein said this of him: “Generations to come wil l scarce believe that such a 
one as this in flesh and blood walked upon this ear th”. His message was based 
on “a series of his experiments with truth” 25, touched upon every domain of 
human life: social, economic, moral/spiritual, cult ural, political.  
Gandhi considered the system based on nonviolence s upreme and essential. 
Now, a question may arise. What is the system which  is based on nonviolence as 
conceived by Gandhi? Dr. Ravindra Kumar insists tha t according to Gandhi: 
that system can only be the real and pure democracy  as 
Ramarajya . Whatever the basis of the democratic system of Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 116 governance that exist in the countries all over the  world 
including India may be, the real democracy i.e. Ramarajya  is 
altogether different. This kind of democratic syste m can be 
introduced in the present ones by evolving nonviole nce with all 
its other facets. Democracy is the government of th e people. In 
fact, justice and freedom for every citizen are pos sible only 
under this system. There is also every possibility of having 
opportunity for progress. It is a source of general  welfare too. 
Gandhi has also said, “Democracy must be in essence …meaning 
the art and science of mobilizing the entire physic al, economic 
and spiritual resources of all the various sections  of people in 
the service of common good of all.”26  
For Gandhi, democracy necessarily means a conflict of will and ideas, involving 
sometimes a war to the knife between different idea s. The very essence of 
democracy is that every person represents all the v aried interests which 
compose the nation. Nevertheless, democracy is a gr eat institution and, 
therefore, it is liable to be greatly abused. It re mains an impossible thing until 
the power is shared by all, but let not democracy d egenerate into mobocracy .  
In most cases, people feel violence can be included  into democracy. Gandhi 
insists that, democracy and violence can ill go tog ether. We can say that 
Gandhi supports a Democracy, disciplined and enligh tened, is the finest thing in 
the world. Gandhi insists that “My notion of democr acy is that under it the 
weakest should have the same opportunity as the str ongest” ( Harijan, 
27.5.1939 ). To safeguard democracy the people must have a ke en sense of 
independence, self-respect and  oneness. In true de mocracy every man and 
women is taught to think for himself or herself. Th e spirit of democracy cannot 
be established in the midst of terrorism, whether g overnmental or popular. To 
this effect, Gandhi defends the place of freedom in  democracy. Thus, Ravindra 
Kumar  insists that  “Gandhi has given prominence t o freedom in democracy 
and in human life as well. He has laid emphasis on decentralization of power as Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 117 guarantee for freedom. Indeed, it is very important  and worth giving a thought 
and acceptable for maturity of democracy.”27  
 
5.5. Is Gandhi Really Relevant For Africa?  
After all said and done, a pertinent question remai ns: Is Gandhi really relevant 
for Africa? This is a question which remains very p ertinent in this our continent 
in which Democracy has become another form of DEM A LL CRAZY. It is worth 
seeing how Tabu Mbeki, the former South African pre sident 15  described Gandhi 
as a great human being. Mbeki said it was not possi ble some years back for an 
Indian Prime Minister to put foot on “our shores”. Gandhi, he said, was “a 
beloved son of South Africa” and provided the leade rship for “this country’s 
triumphant march to freedom”. Noting that India had  in 1946 at the UN put on 
the global agenda the need to end apartheid in Sout h Africa, he said, Gandhi 
had championed the cause of peace with his tenacity . Gandhi may not be here 
physically to do the same in other African countrie s.  However, he remains a 
great soul whose ideas remain a panacea for the Afr ican/ Cameroonian 
democracy. It is a pity that most African countries  spend time propagating 
Marxist theories in Africa. Avijit Ghosh does not m ince words to say that 
“Gandhi is more relevant than Marx today in Africa  (words in italics are 
mine).” 28  
In any country practising democracy, the populace m ust benefit from the 
dividends accruing from it. To this effect, in Afri can countries, after having 
suffered and are still suffering political mishaps,  the word democracy should 
not be only a meaningless sound or an aberration. T he values of the democratic 
system should include the dignity of every human pe rson, the respect of human 
rights, commitment to the common good as the purpos e and guiding criterion 
for political life must be felt. There have truly b een some good points in 
democracy, though not good enough. Democracy is sti ll in a process of 
maturation. We cannot expect that after years of mi litary rule and oppression, 
democracy will appear on a platter of gold. Despite  setbacks and thwarted Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 118 hopes, we can say that democracy in Africa is at le ast half-full. Everyone must 
work to foster democracy. It is not only the proble m of African leaders or the 
church. In our offices, we can refuse bribery. A jo urney of hundred miles begins 
with a step. Here is a message for all Africans and  Cameroonians: We may 
ignore Gandhi at our own risk. Africa needs Gandhi!

CHAPTER SIX 
 
6.0. GANDHI’S MESSAGE TO CHRISTIANS  
Our contemporary world is in need of true witnesses  and not just noisemakers 
or orators whose theories do not reflect their acti ons. The Bible exhorts all 
Christians to translate what they hear into what th ey practice. “Be doers of the 
Word and not just mere hearers lest you deceive you rselves” (Jas 1:22). 
Continuing in this same vein, an adage goes that: “ actions speak louder than 
words”. All these imply that it is not just enough to say “I am a Christian”. “By 
our way of life, people should be able to say: “thi s is a follower of Christ”. 
Jesus himself insists that people will be known by their fruits (Mtt 7: 15-20). It 
is interesting to note that “it was in Antioch that  the disciples were first called 
Christians” (Cf. Ac11:26). The word Christian means  follower of Christ or being 
like Christ. In other words, a Christian is one who se life is based on the 
teachings of Christ. With such a definition, any no n-Christian who has read the 
life of Jesus Christ, especially as presented in th e Gospels and other biblical 
references, will expect to see Christians living up  to, if not nearer to, such 
principles. Gandhi, a non Christian had this same e xperience. 
After reading the life of Christ as presented in th e Bible and in the writings of 
some renowned Christian authors, Gandhi admired the  Sermon on the Mount 
(which shaped his whole philosophy of life) and hop ed to see Christians live up 
to its standards. While living with Christians in E ngland, South Africa and India, 
Gandhi expected to experience qualities like uncond itional love, forgiveness, 
willingness to sacrifice, meekness, etc (Qualities of Christ). To his utmost 
dismay, Christians in his era never lived up to the  standards preached by Christ 
in the Sermon on the Mount and on the Cross.  
Seeing Gandhi live, the Christian missionary E. Sta nley Jones asked him: “Mr 
Gandhi, though you quote the words of Christ often,  why is it that you appear 
to so adamantly reject becoming his follower (Chris tian)”? The latter’s reply Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 122 was clear: “Oh, I don’t reject your Christ. I love your Christ . It is just that so 
many of you Christians are so unlike your Christ” . At this juncture, many 
questions pass in our mind: What led Gandhi to make  such a statement which is 
at the same time a call for concern and an eye open er for any contemporary 
Christian? What can we take from this statement and  what are our fears?  In a 
very succinct presentation, we will see the implica tion of this affirmation to 
our contemporary Christians. On this note, we will see the criticisms and advice 
given by Gandhi on Christianity. Drawing from these  premises, we will evaluate 
the importance of this affirmation to our contempor ary Christians. The 
intention in the last part of this paragraph is to show that with the current 
situation of Christians in Africa and especially in  Cameroon, the Gandhian 
affirmation remains a pertinent interpellation.  
 
6.1. Gandhi’s Contact with Christ: Jesus was for Ga ndhi, a nonviolent 
prophet 
During his studies in England, Gandhi became intere sted in the Christian faith. 
He had been reading the Bible to keep a promise he had made to a friend. He 
had difficulties understanding the Old Testament be cause in it, “he found out 
so much that he could not reconcile with the biddin g of returning good for 
evil.”1 He was studying for the bar exams in London when h e was given the New 
Testament to read. This made a positive impression on him. The Sermon on the 
Mount as he said “went straight to my heart”. In th is sermon, he was fascinated 
by these words: “But I say to you, that ye resist n ot evil: but whosoever smite 
thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also .”2 He insisted always that 
Jesus occupied in his heart the place of one of the  greatest teachers who have 
had a considerable influence in his life…the messag e of Jesus as he understood 
in the Sermon on the Mount unadulterated and taken as a whole. Gandhi got 
two key words from Christianity: the teaching in th e Sermon on the Mount and 
the Symbol of the cross.3 Gandhi described the Sermon on the Mount as the 
whole of Christianity for him who wanted to live a Christian life. Gandhi often Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 123 affirmed: “It is that sermon which has endeared Jes us to me. 4 But what does 
Jesus mean to Gandhi? He revealed this to us in the se words: “I regard Jesus as 
a great teacher of humanity” 5. What really attracted Gandhi to Jesus’ life and 
message is the aspect of Jesus’ suffering.  Sufferi ng for others form one of the 
pillars of Gandhi’s Message to the world. It is wor th noting  that Gandhi’s 
philosophy of nonviolence – satyagraha  as already affirmed above has three 
principles: Truth-  Sat/Satya , Nonviolence-  Ahimsa  and self-suffering-  Tapasya . 
These are called the pillars of Satyagraha. Failure  to grasp them is a handicap 
to the understanding of Gandhi’s nonviolence.  
Gandhi saw all these principles in Jesus’ life and the one that really attracted 
him was the third aspect that is Tapasya  – willingness to self-sacrifice or 
suffering. On this note Gandhi declares: “the examp le of Jesus’ suffering is a 
factor in the composition of my undying faith in no nviolence which rules all my 
actions, worldly and temporal.”6 He kept hanging in his little hut a black and 
white print of Christ on which was written “he is o ur peace”. The picture of the 
crucified Christ wearing only a loin cloth such as is worn by millions of poor 
men in Indian villages, had touched Gandhi’s heart very deeply. It was in the 
Vatican in 1931, after returning from the Roundtabl e conference in London that 
Gandhi saw a life size crucifix and immediately had  an emotional reaction 
towards it.  After gazing at it, he declared: “I sa w there, many nations, like 
individuals, could only be made through the agony o f the cross and no other 
way. Joy comes not by the infliction of pain on oth ers, but the pain voluntarily 
borne by oneself.”7 He understood the cross and believed that when one  lived 
the life Jesus lived, he would probably end up in c onflict with the powers that 
be. For him, Jesus died because of the way he lived . The cross of Christ was 
therefore the result of his living out his way of l ife to the end. On the cross, 
Gandhi saw the perfection of virtue. Living like Ch rist means a living a life of 
the cross, without it, life is long dead. For Gandh i, JESUS DIED IN VAIN if he did 
not teach us to regulate the whole of life by the e ternal law of love.  
Without going too deep into his many points of dive rgence with Christ, it is 
good to insist that he found in Christ the greatest  source of spiritual strength Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 124 that man has never known. For him, Jesus Christ is the highest example of one 
who wished to give everything, asking for nothing i n return. Jesus Christ 
belongs not sorely to Christianity but to the entir e world. Jesus was for him the 
prince of satyagrahi  (a nonviolence activist) . His suffering is a factor in the 
composition of his undying faith in nonviolence. Ju st as Christ passed through 
the test of nonviolence through his virtues of merc y, nonviolence, love, truth, 
forgiveness of his murderer etc., Gandhi’s follower s were trained to forgive and 
thank the jail keeper for performing the arrest. Ga ndhi equally admired the 
gentle figure of Christ, so patient, so kind, so lo ving, and so full of forgiveness 
that he taught his followers not to retaliate when abused but turn the other 
cheek.   
 
6.2. The basis of Gandhi’s hate for Christians  
I love your Christ but I hate your Christians becau se your Christians are unlike 
your Christ . After such a doctrine well founded doctrine on Ch rist, Gandhi will 
obviously expect Christians to be like Christ. Unfo rtunately, he never got it. 
The bone of contention here is to get the hermeneut ics of what Gandhi meant. 
In fact, it is necessary to have faith to be saved but following Christ cannot be 
theoretical. It must be shown in action and in deed s. Before continuing, it is 
worth noting at the back of our minds that  Jesus h ad warned in Mt 7: 21-23 
that: “Not everyone who says to me, `Lord, Lord,' s hall enter the kingdom of 
heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who i s in heaven. On that day 
many will say to me, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophe sy in your name, and cast 
out demons in your name, and do many mighty works i n your name?' And then 
will I declare to them, `I never knew you; depart f rom me, you evildoers”. 
Where can we situate the terminus ad quo  of Gandhi’s rejection of Christianity? 
His rejection grew out of an experience he had in S outh Africa. After reading 
the Bible and the life of Jesus, he was eager to ex ploring becoming a Christian. 
He decided thus to attend a church service. When he  reached the door, the 
church elder asked “where do you think you are goin g, kaffir ....There is no Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 125 room for kaffirs in this church. Get out of here or I’ll have my ass istants throw 
you down the steps”. This is one who was just from reading the life of Christ as 
an epitome of love, unity, etc. Gandhi did not hesi tate to confront Christendom 
with the principles of Christ.  What is the Basis t herefore of Gandhi’s hate for 
the Christians? They are unlike Christ, they do not  put into practice their 
religious principles, they do not favour inculturat ion and enculturation, they 
are more westernised etc. Gandhi does not end in cr iticisms. He presents a 
package of advice to contemporary Christians! 
 
6.3. Gandhi’s Advice to the contemporary Christian 
“You Christians, especially missionaries, should beg in to live 
more like Christ. You should spread more of the gos pel of love 
and you should study non-Christian faiths to have m ore 
sympathetic understanding of their faiths.” 8  
This citation summarises Gandhi’s advice for the co ntemporary Christians. We 
ought to be true imitators of Christ and by so doin g; we should also seek to 
understand other religions. The Catholic Church is really doing so today through 
her clarion call for ecumenism and inter-religious dialogue. Most of the 
Christian groups that preached to Gandhi quoted Joh n 3:16 and forced people 
to believe. Gandhi felt that Christians should not just preach, but should put 
into practice what they preached. 
 to live the gospel is the most effective in the be ginning, in the 
middle and in the end…a life of service and uttermo st simplicity 
is the best preaching…you quote instead John 3:16 a nd ask them 
to believe it. That has no appeal to me… where ther e has been 
acceptance of the gospel through preaching, my comp laint is 
that there has been some motive…A rose does not nee d to 
preach. It simply spreads its fragrance. The fragra nce is its own 
sermon.9 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 126 For Gandhi, how we treat other tells the people mor e about what we believe. A 
better Christian follows Jesus in words and deeds. It is thus not just enough to 
distribute tracts or deliver sound sermons. 
Pastor Mike Powel in his sermon insisted that Gandh i loved the teachings of 
Jesus Christ and the wisdom contained in the Bible,  but he did not feel 
Christians lived up to these standards. The feeling  that Christians do not 
measure up to the Golden Rule they extol, causes no n-Christians to see them as 
hypocrites. Christians by the nature of bearing tha t name are expected to be 
righteous, kind and pure. When Christians do not sh ow those qualities, it is a 
disappointment to everyone.  Christians need to rea lise that they are as 
imperfect as everyone else and as a result of this,  they should truly repent. In 
the past, Christians have not measured up to the id eals set forth by Jesus 
Christ. Sometimes, Christians have fallen short of ideals that it fills an onlooker 
with embarrassment. 10  In essence, Gandhi accepted Christianity but rejec ted 
“churchianity” in a very vocal manner. 11  
From his childhood, Christian missionaries stood on  the corner of his grade 
school loudly deriding the gods and beliefs of Hind uism. Converts to Christianity 
were “denationalised”, “Britishised”. Christianity was “beef and brandy” (most 
Hindus are vegetarians). He was greatly disturbed w hen he heard Christians put 
aside the Sermon on the Mount as impractical or a d reamy idealism. He 
believes that, what is lived as Christianity is a n egation of the Sermon on the 
Mount. He criticised mostly Christianity as practic ed by Europe and the rest of 
the West. He criticised Christianity’s cultural imp erialism. He perceived this 
phenomenon to be a destroyer of the Indian culture with its aggressive 
missionary work. His plea was for Christians to bec ome more Christian. For 
Gandhi, Christianity became disfigured when it went  to the West. The frightful 
outrage that was going on in Europe during his time  ( war, colonialism ) showed 
that “the message of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of peace has been little 
understood in Europe, and that light upon it may ha ve to be shown from the 
East.”12  In Gandhi’s era, those who called themselves Chris tians (Europe) were 
just from taking part and consenting into two World  Wars! This is a very big Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 127 scandal for a nonviolence activist. “It is a very c urious commentary on the West 
that although it professes Christianity, there is n o Christianity or Christ in the 
West or there should have been no war.”13 Here is his clear criticism for 
Christianity: 
I ask my Christian brethren...not to take their Chr istianity as it 
is interpreted in the West. There, we know, they fi ght with one 
another as never before. After all, Jesus was an As iatic depicted 
as wearing the Arabian flowing robe. He was the ess ence of 
meekness. I hope that the Christians of India will express in their 
lives Jesus the crucified, of the Bible, and not as  interpreted in 
the West with her blood-stained fingers. I have no desire to 
criticize the West. I know and value the many virtu es of the 
West. But I am bound to point out that Jesus of Asi a is 
misrepresented in the West except in individuals. 14 
Thomas Merton bought Gandhi’s idea when he constant ly asked himself: “What 
has Gandhi to do with Christianity?” From this ques tion, he insisted vehemently 
that everyone knows that the Orient has venerated C hrist and distrusted 
Christians since the first colonizers and missionar ies came from the West. 
Western Christians often assume without much examin ation that this oriental 
respect for Christ is simply a vague, syncretistic and perhaps romantic evasion 
of the challenge of the Gospel: an attempt to absor b the Christian message into 
the confusion and inertia which are thought to be c haracteristic of Asia. It is 
true that Gandhi expressly dissociated himself from  Christianity in its visible 
and institutional forms. But it is also true that h e built his whole life and all his 
activity upon what he conceived to be the law of Ch rist. In fact, he died for this 
law which was at the heart of his belief. Gandhi wa s indisputably sincere and 
right in his moral commitment to the law of love an d truth. A Christian can do 
nothing greater than follow his own conscience with  fidelity. Gandhi obeyed 
what he believed to be the voice of God.15 
 Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 128 6.4. Relevance of Gandhi to the Contemporary Christ ian  
It is worth noting that Gandhi influenced and keeps  influencing Christians. We 
shall not propose that the contemporary Christian b ecomes a Hindu like Gandhi 
before becoming “like Christ”. The ball has already  been set rolling by Gandhi’s 
life and message. If a non Christian can honour and  imitate Jesus in this way, 
what more of those who call themselves, and really are, Christians? 
Gandhi’s relevance for the contemporary Christian c an be shown from what 
happened at the Westminster Abbey in London on the 17 th  of February 1948. 
Just like John Paul II whose funeral mass saw unite d together around his 
remains political and religious leaders whom he had  been trying to put together 
during his lifetime, the message of Gandhi to imita te Christ and to unite was 
well understood. The cathedral was full and in a fe stive mood. The rector of 
the cathedral took up the floor and said “today thi s service is in memory of 
Mahatma Gandhi who has just been assassinated. He i ntoned a hymn and the 
populace responded. Here is a paraphrased translati on from the French version 
of what he said: 
We give thanks to you O lord for the witnessing 
Of Mahatma Gandhi to the Truth 
Of the Sermon on the Mount 
And for his life of service 
And for his defence of the poor … 
And for his action of peace 
And for his hatred of violence 
And for the witnessing which he has given 
That love and sacrifice 
Have a saving power . 16 
I am sure, without renouncing in any way any cathol ic dogma, that if Gandhi 
were to be a catholic Christian, we should have bee n thinking of calling him Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 129 “Saint Gandhi”. This thinking is not supported by a ll. Robert Ellsberg criticises 
Gandhi on the grounds that the latter only “accepts  the Sermon on Mount 
thinking it supports his principle of nonviolence a nd denies the rest of Jesus’ 
teachings and claims.”17 Nevertheless, what we can learn from Gandhi is how  to 
put to practice what we profess. In fact his life s hould be a painful reminder to 
Christians. His’ was not mere intellectual apprecia tion of the teachings of 
Jesus. His understanding was grounded in the ethics  of the Sermon on the 
Mount where some of this partners and adversaries p rofessed to be Christians 
with whom he was engaged for over fifty years. In t he process, he has left us 
two edited works: “ What Jesus means to me ” and “ The Jesus I love ”. 
What is certainly true is that Gandhi not only unde rstood the ethic of the 
Gospel as well, if not in some ways better, than mo st Christians, but he is one 
of the very few men of our time who applied Gospel principles to the problems 
of a political and social existence in such a way t hat his approach to these 
problems was inseparably religious and political at  the same time. Christians 
understand the theology of the cross, while Gandhi puts it into practice. The 
missionary, Stanley Jones gives his own personal vi ew of what he learned from 
Gandhi: “Gandhi has taught me more of the Sprit of Christ than has others in 
the East or West…The world which calls itself Chris tian talk of truth but Gandhi 
puts it in practice. Here is the difference…Never i n human history has much 
light been thrown on the cross. It is only through this man who was not a 
Christian.”18  
 
6.5. Criticisms of the affirmation: “I love your Ch rist but I hate your 
Christians...”  
All what we have been trying to put together concer ning the relevance of the 
Gandhian affirmation “ I love your Christ but I hate your Christians becau se 
your Christians are unlike your Christ” to  the contemporary Christian  boil down 
to  the fact that, the contemporary Christian should im bibe and synthesise the 
dialectic between discourse  (thesis) and praxis  (antithesis). This implies putting Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 130 into practice the words which we profess vocally. I t is not enough to say Christ. 
It is better to be like Christ and by our fruits pe ople will say “these are 
Christians”!  
What does the contemporary Christian interpret in t he word sacrifice? We are 
in a society where capitalism and egoism cut throug h the fabric of 
Christendom. How many of us can sacrifice ourselves  for others in this 
contemporary world. True enough Maximillian Kolbe d id so in Poland. Martin 
Luther King Jr. did same in the USA. Oscar Romero d id so in El Savador. 
Contemporary Christians should follow suit. The cro ss of Christ should be our 
guide. In a contemporary world where revenge and un forgiveness even among 
Christians remain the order of the day, Gandhi teac hes us to imitate Christ 
teachings in the Sermon on the Mount. If we do so t hen Gandhi can give the 
following message to Christians: “ I love your Christ and I LOVE your Christians 
because your Christians are making efforts to be li ke your Christ”. 
Gandhi essentially came to view Christianity, espec ially Western Christianity, as 
a betrayal of everything that Christ stood for.  He  saw someone such as Tolstoy 
as embodying what he understood to be the teachings  of Christ; after 
Constantine, it is Gandhi's view, the institutional ization of Christianity 
delivered a death blow to Christ's teachings 
 
6.7. The Catholic Church and Nonviolence. 
The Catholic Church has always tried to defend the rights of the poor and 
defend the world against violence. Despite its pers ecutions on some individuals 
in the medieval era, the Catholic Social Teaching t oday consists primarily of a 
theology of peace. The Church is gradually embracin g nonviolence. Through her 
catechisms and other documents, the church promotes  virtues like peace, 
justice, inter-religious dialogues, Ecumenism, etc.  The Papal Encyclical Pacem 
in Terris  of Pope John XXIII regarded the need for a new wor ld order based on 
peace and common good. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 131 The Pope John Paul II commenting on the Pacem in Terris  commended the U.N. 
and called for a new constitutional organization of  the human family, truly 
capable of ensuring peace and harmony between peopl es as well as their 
integral human development. Pope John Paul II has a lways preached 
nonviolence. He is of the opinion that “Those who b uilt their lives on 
nonviolence have gives us a luminous example of int egrity and loyalty, often to 
the point of martyrdom, have provided us with rich and splendid lesson”.  19 
In his address on January 1 st  2005, the Holy Father exhorted us to abandon 
violence and embrace nonviolence, in order to build  a society based on peace 
and common good. He puts it thus: 
To attain the good of peace, there must be a clear and conscious 
acknowledgement that violence is an unacceptable ev il and that it 
never solves problems…. Fostering peace by overcomi ng evil with 
good requires careful reflection on the common good  and on its 
social and political implications. 20 
 
The Catholic Bishops of many dioceses have preached  nonviolence either single 
handedly or collectively. One has to admire with aw e Arch Bishop Oscar Romero 
who fought vigorously and nonviolently for the caus e of the poor. 
The U.S. Catholic Bishops acknowledge the impact of  Gandhi on Christian 
thoughts thus: “In the twentieth century, presiding  from the non-Christian 
witness of a Mahatma Gandhi and its worldwide impac t, the nonviolent witness 
of such figures as Dorothy Day and Martin Luther Ki ng has had profound impact 
upon the life of the church…” 21 
Back here in Africa, the Church has been highly con cerned with the use of 
nonviolence. In Cameroon, the efforts of Christian Cardinal Tumi, in opposing 
the wrong deeds of Presidents Ahmadou Ahhidjo and P aul Biya nonviolently 
cannot be neglected. The Cameroonian Bishops have n ot failed in their duties 
to ring a correction bell to the government. Since 1977, the Bishops of 
Bamenda and Buea had charged Cardinal Tumi, then Re ctor of the Major 
Seminary in Bambui to form an ecumenical group call ed “Christian Study 
Group” with aim to analyse the socio-political even ts in Cameroon in the light Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 132 of the Gospel of Christ. As a result of their findi ngs the Bishops, on the 27 th  of 
February 1977 published a pastoral letter entitled:  “The Fight against 
Corruption in Cameroon” 22 . They willingly showed that there exist in Cameroo n 
a high rate of Bribery and corruption. Material wea lth has become the supreme 
and highest good for some of us camerooninans.  
In recent years, Cardinal Tumi as shown in the prec eding chapters has been one 
of Cameroon's most outspoken voices, demanding an e nd to government 
corruption and restrictions on press freedoms. He a lso has accused the country's 
police force of torture and carrying out summary ex ecutions. In a September 
2004 speech delivered in Milan, Italy, the cardinal  said his country was ruled by 
“the law of the strongest” and that elections were continually marred by ballot 
rigging. He said “the facade of democracy” in Camer oon “exists more for 
creating a pleasing, external image than for promot ing individual and collective 
liberties. The proof is (found in) electoral fraud. ” 22  Soon after the election 
results handed President Biya a third consecutive t erm of office in October 
2004, Tumi fumed that since independence from Franc e and Great Britain in 
1961, Cameroon has never had transparent elections.  The cardinal, along with 
the nation's other bishops, has repeatedly called o n Biya -- in power since 1982 
-- to let the country move toward political plurali sm. Cardinal Tumi has always 
hammered that it is the duty of the church to denou nce the dishonesty of some 
government officials since the church has a duty to  educate people about 
honesty.  
There is real need for Justice and peace perpetrate d by the Christians here in 
Cameroon. Song Eugene observes that: 
 Such an image is a far-fetched dream in Christian Cameroon if one 
were to go by the alarming cases of injustices, vio lence, 
discrimination, corruption and “god-fatherism” that  have eaten 
deep into the fabrics of the society. This shows ho w shallow 
Christianity has penetrated the life of this people …they have not 
yet learnt to live as brothers and sisters in a chu rch family of God. 
There is deep rooted hatred amongst the people….Wit h this Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 133 gloomy picture, we have the impression that the chu rch as family 
in Cameroon is not a hamlet of peace, love and care . 23 
An immediate reaction to this is to say, Fr. Eugene  Song is too hard on the 
Cameroonian Christians. Looking at it from another perspective however, one 
notices that he proves there are rivalries and squa bbles among tribes and 
ethnic groups which have eaten into the fabrics of the Church. A glaring 
example which he potrays is the event that took pla ce on the 17 th , July 1999 
when Mgr. A. Wouking (RIP) from the Bamileke  tribe was appointed as 
archbishop of Yaoundé. As Fr. Eugene Song observes,  there was open rejection 
by the “Christians of Yaoundé under the conspiracy of some diocesan priests 
and politicians…Priests claiming to be indigenes of  the archdiocese wrote to the 
Vatican saying ‘le pape a fait une erreur’, that is , the Pope has made a 
mistake.” 24 Cameroonian Christians need Gandhi’s! The situation  of our country 
is really deplorable. We need a nonviolent prophet who will stand up and fight 
the alarming rate of Bribery and corruption, ethnic  and tribal wars which 
invade our country.  We need Gandhi in Africa as sh own by the AECAWA.  
The inter-religious Dialogue Commission of the Asso ciation of Episcopal 
Conference of Anglophone West Africa (AECAWA) has p resented many study 
papers to preach inter-religious Dialogue and the n eed for nonviolence in 
Africa. They are: 
(1) Inter-religious Dialogue and Nation Building Ibadan , 3-6 October 2000. 
(2) Religion, Violence and Peace in West Africa Accra, 7-10 October 2002. 
Vincent Boi Nai a member of AECAWA highlighted the role played by great 
figures like Gandhi. He attests that: 
People like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr.,  and Nelson 
Mandela have taken history in a new direction. They  have shown 
the power of nonviolence. Though they did not achie ve their goals 
100%, nevertheless, they showed a way that is worth  following.  25

7.0. THE WAY FORWARD 
 
7.1. Is Gandhi’s Doctrine Possible? 
Gandhi’s doctrine of nonviolence has been shown to be very relevant and 
timely in many situations. He professed a philosoph y, which he himself 
experimented in many situations, especially in gain ing independence for India. 
One begins to imagine the number of lives Gandhi ha s touched. However, it is 
not a bed of roses for Gandhi and his followers.  
Gandhi faced heated criticisms right from the time he was still alive. Those who 
could not contain his innovations had him assassina ted. Jinnah Mohammed Ali 
disagreed most of the times with Gandhi and was ins trumental for the 
formation of what we have today as Pakistan. 
Can Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence be understoo d is Iraq? Can it solve the 
current problems in the Middle East? Mandela found himself unable to continue 
with the application of Gandhian nonviolence and en ded up making use of 
sabotage. Steger accuses Gandhi of sometimes condon ing with what he called 
“conceptual violence.” 1 That is the construction of an “other” who is spiri tually 
inferior or lacks truth. This lapse into conceptual  violence theoretically 
delimitates his theory of nonviolence. Earlier on i n 1920, Gandhi claimed that 
his nonviolence was a universal philosophy. He clai med that “my religion 
(nonviolence) has no geographical limits. If I have  a living faith in it, it will 
transcend India herself.” 2 Gandhi however sacrificed at times his nonviolence 
principles in favour of nationalist power. 
Any Universalist theory must be accessible to all w ithout exception. It shuns 
inequality. Gandhi’s concerns for his nationalist p rinciples have plunged him 
into so many criticisms and have many moral implica tions. His critics claim that 
he tended to represent a theory of community based on the exclusion of others. 
Steger further notes that Gandhi made political cho ices in the interests of 
nationalist power and tainted his universal moral p hilosophy of nonviolence. He Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 137 further claims, “By participating in the instrument al process of seizing political 
power from the British, he (Gandhi) risked the dilu tion of his nonviolent 
principles.” 3 Furthermore, Gandhi though claiming a Universalisti c philosophy, 
invited a particular Indian history tied to a parti cular group of people. Even 
within the Indian context, Gandhi tended to speak w ith a predominantly Hindu 
context. Nobody speaks from nowhere.  
On surface view, Gandhi’s interpretation appeared a s a “Manichaean world of 
good and evil with both violence and nonviolence se rving as the main players.” 
4 However, though Gandhi viewed violence as evil and nonviolence as good, it is 
difficult to reconcile his nonviolence with the way  he took part in wars. Four 
times during his life, Gandhi offered his services to the army. Despite efforts to 
defend this attitude of, it still remains controver sial to many people. However, 
the war service was something Gandhi outgrew.  
On another note, some moralist find problem with Ga ndhi’s view of mercy 
killing. In the ashram, there was an ailing calf, w hich lay in agony beyond 
treatment. Gandhi decided to kill it by slow inject ion. When challenged if this 
would be done in the case of man, Gandhi’s response  seems to support 
Euthanasia. He said: 
In practice however, we do not cut short the suffer ings of our 
ailing ones by death, because as a rule, we have al ways means at 
our disposal to help them, and they have the capaci ty to think and 
decide for themselves. But supposing that in the ca se of an ailing 
friend, I am unable to render aid, and recovery is out of the 
question, and the patient is lying in an unconsciou s state in the 
throes of agony then I would not see any himsa in p utting an end 
to his suffering by death. 5 
In another case Gandhi was very absolute by saying,  “should my child be 
attacked with rabies and there was no helpful remed y to receive his agony, I 
should consider it my duty to take his life.” 6 Such views portray mercy killing 
and are negative because it is a usurpation of God’ s lordship over human life. I. 
M. Onyeocha attests that “The initial intention is to put the person to death, Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 138 while the ostensible reason is to make death easier  and less painful and 
agonizing when it is considered that continued life  would be burdensome.” 7 
Gandhi cannot go away un-punctured for his “hate” f or Christians treated in the 
sixth chapter of this book. He seemed to have under stood the Sermon on the 
Mount in a literary way. He tried judging Christian ity with the standards of 
Hinduism. He read only the portions of the Bible wh ich moved in line with his 
frame of thoughts, and without reading all, he trie d universalising the 
particular. The Sermon on the Mount literally under stood is NOT the whole of 
the Bible with 73 books! Even the Ethiopian Eunuch when reading the Old 
Testament Scriptures asked for the help of Philip b ecause the former could not 
understand (Ac 8:26-40). One can quickly conclude i n Gandhi’s case that the 
latter did not understand the Old Testament, so he kept it off from his 
doctrine. He could have asked for explanations from  some biblical scholars.  
We should not rely much on these criticisms lest af ter bathing a child 
thoroughly, we throw away the washbowl and the chil d! We can learn from 
Gandhi’s mistakes and sieve his thinking to take wh at is necessary. After 
reading the Gandhian affirmation which has been our  bone of contention all 
this while, we insist that the contemporary Christi an needs to put into practice 
what he hears and believes. 
It is interesting to note that Gandhi, according to  Vinay Lal is someone 
everyone loves to hate. Lal insists:  
Gandhi has legions of admirers, but he has also bee n the target of 
severe, even virulent, criticism from numerous pers pectives. 
Though Gandhi still commands veneration from many, he is also 
someone everyone loves to hate. Some critics fault him for 
particular positions, such as his support of the Kh ilafat movement, 
his inexplicable views on the Bihar earthquake, his  deployment of 
Hindu imagery or idioms of speech such as ‘Ram Rajy a’, and so on. 
Other critics, arguing from specific ideological po sitions, are 
inclined to find systemic shortcomings in Gandhi’s views 8. Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 139 Many scholars like Vinay Lal ask so many interestin g questions about Gandhi 
that one cannot fail to mention in these criticisms : why did Gandhi's legacy 
have no impact in countries such as Uganda and Keny a, where there were 
substantial Indian populations and yet the Indians faced eviction and 
discrimination?  If even the Indian populations in Africa could not sustain 
Gandhi's teachings, should we expect that African p eople should have done so? 
 
7.2. The Way Forward for Africa 
After such a flamboyant expose on the relevance of Gandhi’s Doctrine of 
Nonviolence to Africa, the chief question remains: What is the way forward for 
Africa to adopt nonviolence? How can Africa, move s tep by step towards 
adopting an African Voice of Nonviolence? This invo lves adopting Peace in 
African Societies in the religious, political, deve lopmental and educational 
hemisphere.  Many African thinkers and theologians like Jean Blaise Kenmonge, 
Kä Mana in the book “Pour la voie africaine de la non-violence”  (Towards an 
African voice of Nonviolence) have recently asked t his question: “Is it possible 
to imagine today an African voice of nonviolence an d propose it to the world 
for a new project of civilisation and of culture?” 9 The expected answer is 
obviously YES. A yes which does not end in imaginat ions but of course, a YES 
which will encourage Africa to incarnate and invent  a nonviolent doctrine to 
fight the chaos that the world order has placed Afr ica into, as reflected in all 
the African calamities. In the preface to this book , Mgr Jean-Bosco Ntep, of the 
diocese of Edea in Cameroon observed that, in terms  of philosophy and practice 
of nonviolence as a necessity for education towards  peace, having as its base 
the construction of a society based on Justice, Pro sperity and Respect of 
Human Rights, Africa has not yet vigorously and dec isively imposed her voice to 
reflect. Despite the presence of so many associatio ns and movements in the 
society which are apt to implement the methods of n onviolent action in many 
African countries, it is a pity that our continent has not yet clearly shown 
clearly and with determination this moving force 10 . Nkrumah dreamt of having a 
united Africa. It is our thinking that nonviolence goes with unity. Gandhi fought Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 140 vigorously to unite people. The best way forward fo r Africa is to be united. 
What happens in some African countries is quite app alling. Many who travel 
complain of the maltreatments received at the embas sies in trying to get visas 
and also of the way they are badly treated in the r eceiving countries in Africa. 
We insist with Nkrumah that“Africa Must Unite!” Mos t African nationssince the 
year 2010 have been celebrating 50 years of indepen dence. One is tempted to 
ask if it is really fifty years of independence or fifty years of neo-colonialism. 
Many think that Africa must adopt a New Independenc e which involves healing 
our selves from this sickeness of neo-colonialism a nd creating a new destiny 
built on African values. Africans need to feel free  in the African continent and 
affirm themselves in the world. Africans will need to quit the consumer stage 
and take their right place in producing in all doma ins of life.  
After about fifty years of African independence whi ch in my own humble 
opinion have failed, it is necessary to adopt the c larion call of professor Ka 
Mana: THERE IS URGENCY! There is urgency in thinkin g of the New 
independence of Africa in terms of grandeur, libert y and creative power. There 
is urgency to reconstruct the future of Africa. The re is urgency in thinking of 
the leadership of Africa in terms of the welfare of  the people. There is urgency 
in putting in place political, economic and cultura l institutions capable of 
bringing up the capacity of Africans inventing and organising themselves. There 
is urgent need of  intergrating the life of each Af rican in a regional dynamic of 
cooperation and political solidarity in order to bu ild a sound political system. 
Since there is urgency, we need to hasten up and or ganise our countries so that 
Africa should succeed. We need to crave the path ev en if it means carving 
roads through solid rocks. In effect the time has c ome to make our countries 
shine with the light of the new independence. There  is urgency! 11  
 Africa is aware of the light great people like Gan dhi, Martin Luther King Jr, and 
a host of others mentioned above have brought forwa rd to show that 
nonviolence is an indispensable necessity and an im perative to bring 
concordance and authentic harmony among humans. The  bishop observes also 
that Africa so far has not taken time to reflect on  her religious treasures, social Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 141 norms and cultural values to offer proposals to the  great barbarity ravaging our 
continent. Africa finds herself in a modernity in w hich, politics, economy 
international relations among religions are confron ted by multiform absurdities. 
Despite this, Africa has not taken enough time to d iscover these modern forms 
of exploitation and domination, Africa has not prop osed any new project of 
civilisation grounded on nonviolence.  
 
7.2. Conclusion  
In spite of all the heated criticisms on Gandhi, it  is worth noting that he 
remains a fallible human being. In effect, “Gandhi may not have been his own 
best critic, his critics have also not done him the  justice of attempting to 
understand how he negotiated the various critical w orldviews that he 
encountered” 12 . It was not by chance that he was given the “Mahatma”  and 
“Bapu”  titles. Anyone who critically examines his theorie s will hurriedly 
conclude that he was saint like. While recognizing his shortcomings, his 
philosophy of nonviolence remains a masterpiece. He  is the emancipator of the 
oppressed, the freedom and the empowerment of the p eople vis-à-vis a 
totalitarian and centralized state which has usurpe d all such freedom and 
power. With his philosophy, politicians will be per suaded to understand the 
dangers of violence.  
Gandhi faced heated criticisms from feminists, Marx ists etc. Nevertheless, he 
opened up himself to criticisms by his frankness in  his autobiography as Vinay 
Lal beautifully puts it: 
Since Gandhi himself never much abided by the disti nction 
between the private and the public, he also opened himself up to 
criticism. It is doubtful, for example, that anyone  would have 
known anything of that very small heap of indiscret ions which he 
describes in his autobiography and later writings –  the theft of a 
few gold coins from the family home; the visit to a  brothel from 
where he emerged, predictably, with his virginity i ntact; the Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 142 wretched encounter, which commenced and ended in hi s mind via 
the belly, with a dead goat; the lust that drove hi m to Kasturba’s 
bed while his father lay dying; and the immense dis appointment he 
experienced in his 60s when he was painfully brough t to the 
awareness that he had not yet mastered the sexual i nstinct – had 
Gandhi not himself rendered his life, in his words,  into an open 
book 13. 
On this note, rather than spending countless hours criticising someone whose 
life remains an open book, well disposed to critici sm, it is better to learn from 
his many virtues. 
Gandhi’s intellectual influence on his countrymen w as considerable. Some were 
attracted by his emphasis on political and economic  decentralization; others by 
his insistence on individual freedom, moral integri ty, the unity of means and 
ends, and social service; still others by his Satya graha and political activism. 
For some students of India, Gandhi’s influence is r esponsible for its failure to 
throw up any genuinely radical political movement. For others it cultivated a 
spirit of nonviolence, encouraged the habits of col lective self-help, and helped 
lay the foundations of a stable, morally committed,  and democratic 
government. Gandhi’s ideas have also had a profound  influence outside India, 
where they inspired nonviolent activism and movemen ts in favour of small-
scale, self-sufficient communities living closer to  nature and with greater 
sensitivity to their environment.  
Gandhi’s moral and political thought was based on a  relatively simple 
metaphysic. For him the universe was regulated by a  Supreme Intelligence or 
Principle, which he preferred to call satya  (Truth) and, as a concession to 
convention, God. It was embodied in all living thin gs, above all in human 
beings, in the form of self-conscious soul or spiri t. Since all human beings 
partook of the divine essence, they were “ultimatel y one”. They were not 
merely equal but “identical”. As such, love was the  only proper form of relation 
between them; it was “the law of our being”, of “ou r species”. Positively, love 
implied care and concern for others and total dedic ation to the cause of Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 143 “wiping away every tear from every eye”. Negatively , it implied ahimsa, or 
“nonviolence”. Gandhi’s entire social and political  thought, including his theory 
of Satyagraha, was an attempt to work out the impli cations of the principle of 
love in all areas of life. 
For Gandhi, the state “represented violence in a co ncentrated form”. It spoke 
in the language of compulsion and uniformity, sappe d its subjects’ spirit of 
initiative and self-help, and “unmanned” them. Sinc e human beings were not 
fully developed and capable of acting in a socially  responsible manner, the 
state was necessary. However, if it was not to hind er their growth, it had to be 
so organized that it used as little coercion as pos sible and left as large an area 
of human life as possible to voluntary efforts. 
As Gandhi imagined it, a truly nonviolent society w as federally constituted and 
composed of small, self-governing, and relatively s elf-sufficient village 
communities relying largely on moral and social pre ssure. The police were 
basically social workers, enjoying the confidence a nd support of the local 
community and relying on moral persuasion and publi c opinion to enforce the 
law. Crime was treated as a disease, requiring not punishment but 
understanding and help. The standing army was not n ecessary either, for a 
determined people could be relied upon to mount non violent resistance against 
an invader. In Gandhi’s view it was a “sin against humanity” to possess 
superfluous wealth.  
A nonviolent society was committed to Sarvodaya, th e growth or uplift of all its 
citizens. Private property denied the “identity” or  “oneness” of all men, and 
was immoral. In Gandhi’s view it was a “sin against  humanity” to possess 
superfluous wealth when others could not even meet their basic needs. Since 
the institution of private property already existed , and men were attached to 
it, he suggested that the rich should take only wha t they needed and hold the 
rest in trust for the community. Increasingly he ca me to appreciate that the 
idea of trusteeship was too important to be left to  the precarious goodwill of 
the rich, and suggested that it could be enforced b y organized social pressure 
and even by law. Gandhi advocated heavy taxes, limi ted rights of inheritance, Africa Needs Gandhi 
 
www.mkgandhi.org Page 144 state ownership of land and heavy industry, and nat ionalization without 
compensation as a way of creating a just and equal society. 
Gandhi touches the lives of everyone both young and  Old. Michael Nagler 
recounts how Gandhi touched him since from the age of 10:  
By the time I came to Berkeley, already a “peacenik ” with the 
rhetoric of the civil rights movement echoing in my  ears, I had of 
course heard of Gandhi—but like most Americans, I k new little 
enough about him. A few days after my eleventh birt hday I saw a 
picture of the Mahatma’s cremation and the wild gri ef of the 
mourners on the cover of Life magazine, which left a distinct 
impression of otherness, even weirdness, about the man and his 
culture, and the little I later heard—about his fas ts, his asceticism—
did little to dispel this first impression. I admir ed his achievements, 
but they seemed almost more than human. I felt that  he was 
probably a great man, and I was not, and that was t hat. But when 
Sri Easwaran began to weave his own reminiscences o f Gandhi into 
his inspiring talks, slowly and from many angles sh edding light on 
who Gandhi really was, an entirely new picture emer ged. I began to 
see that Gandhi was at once much greater and yet mo re relevant—
even to my own little life—than I had imagined 14. 
We still insist that If humanity is to progress, Ga ndhi is inescapable. He lived, 
thought and acted, inspired by the vision of humani ty evolving toward a world 
of peace and harmony. Who is this great man that en vironmentalists, pacifists, 
conscientious objectors, non-violent activists, nud ists, naturopaths, 
vegetarians, prohibitionists, social reformers, int ernationalists, moralists, trade 
union leaders, political dissidents, hunger striker s, anarchists, luddites, 
celibates, anti-globalisation activists, pluralists , ecumenists, walkers, and many 
others have at one time or another claimed as their  patron saint, or at least  
drawn inspiration from him? We may ignore Gandhi at  our own risk. The world 
needs Gandhi, Africa needs Gandhi.

 Africa Needs Gandhi

OUTER COVER 
Mandela puts it that India is Gandhi’s country of b irth and South Africa his 
country of adoption because he began his philosophy  of nonviolence in South 
Africa. The Gandhian influence dominated freedom st ruggles on the African 
continent right up to 1960s because of the power it  generated and the unity it 
forged among the apparently powerless Nonviolence w as the official stance of 
all major African coalitions. Seeing the situation of Africa today, there is a 
special need for an inculcation of the Gandhian Doc trine of Nonviolence. 
In Africa, morality/human rights have been overtake n by the growing tendency 
to violence. Violence reveals itself in the form of  wars (like in Congo D.R., 
Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, etc ), ritual killings, injustices, 
rigging of elections etc. Such violence in Africa s eems to come in most cases 
from rulers who terrorize their citizens. Such lead ers terrorize their people 
with arbitrary laws…. Those who succeeded them have  invariably had to resolve 
to the case of force. Most African Leaders continue  to boast of their might and 
remain dictators.  
In Africa, most countries practicing democracy do n ot meet up to the standards 
required. Presidents in Democratic regimes remain o n seat for many decades, 
for example, Paul Biya of Cameroon, Mugabe of Zimba bwe, Gadafi of Libya etc. 
African countries have been turned into political s tates where those who cry for 
justice are arrested, detained, tortured, imprisone d and even killed, but yet 
claim that these countries are oases of freedom.  Many citizens have started 
appreciating the philosophy of nonviolence. Onyeoch a attests that, in Africa, it 
was not by chance but by conscious choice that nonv iolence was preferred to 
violence.” Freedom fighters in Africa like Nyerere,  Nkrumah, and Mandela, 
have testified the importance of nonviolence in the ir lives, thanks to Gandhi’s 
influence.  
This book treats the relevance of Gandhi’s doctrine  of nonviolence with special 
reference to Africa and Cameroon.  It is recommende d for all lovers of Peace, 
Love and Nonviolence.

Gandhi is loved and celebrated as an apostle of  non-
violence. Yet it is Gandhi’s little-known work on what 
it means to be truly civilized that might be far more 
crucial to the future of  our species.  
Gandhi’s civilizational vision can serve as a new lens 
to understand contemporary global crises – identity-
based conflicts, the failed promise of  universal 
prosperity and the threat of  ecological collapse. 
What we have here are not ready solutions but a 
framework which might help us to forge solutions.8Introduction
A British reporter, the story goes, once asked Mahatma Gandhi 
what he thought of Western civilization � Gandhi replied: “It 
would be a good idea �”
Gandhi’s words were accurately recorded� This moment, when 
Gandhi landed in Britain in 1930, is captured on film. It is the question that was twisted over several decades of  retelling � What 
the reporter actually asked was: “Mr � Gandhi, what do you think of  
modern civilization?” [1]
It is unlikely that replacing ‘modern’ with ‘western’ was a 
deliberate, political act � Since modernity originated as a Western 
project, the terms are often used interchangeably � At times, Gandhi 
himself  did so � And yet, the misquotation is unfair to Gandhi 
and a burden for our present and future � The ‘West’ that Gandhi 
encountered was indeed problematic in many ways � But Gandhi’s 
most incisive insights are about fatal flaws in ‘modern’ civilization. 
Civilization, said Gandhi, is not about technology and material 
comforts � On the contrary, he insisted, true civilization is that 
which shows us the path of  duty and anchors our life to a higher purpose � His radical critique was completely non-sectarian, anti-
racist and trans-national�
A century has gone by since Gandhi dissected and analysed 
modern civilization� For much of  this time, it has been commonplace to either ignore or ridicule his critique � He has been dismissed as a 
back-to-nature faddist who mistrusted machinery � Since the term 
‘modern’ is also associated with human rights, adult franchise, and equality before the law, it seems patently absurd to suggest that the modern is no civilization at all�
So what then were Gandhi’s apprehensions about the ‘modern’ 
and why should that critique matter today?9Introduction
Many of  us are aware that Gandhi’s approach to life is directly 
opposed to the “greed is good” culture that has been celebrated 
on Wall Street and in financial markets across the world. It is 
assumed that Gandhi took the moral high ground� What is not 
so well-known is that Gandhi recognised greed-is-good as a new 
phenomenon; he understood the historical and cultural roots of  the veneration of  avarice �
The ‘modern’ which Gandhi critiqued was a process by which 
knowledge, science and economics were wrenched from their 
ethical and spiritual moorings – and set asunder from moral philosophy �
It was this historical process which 
led the epoch-shaping economist John Maynard Keynes to argue, in 1930, that “For at least another hundred years we 
must pretend to ourselves and to everyone 
that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not �” [2]
After the financial crisis of  2008, 
there has been widespread lamentation 
that the greed-is-good doctrine has gone 
overboard� However, our contemporary 
problems – social inequity, financial 
instability and environmental imbalance – 
are not just due to an excess of  avarice � They are a consequence 
of  something far more fundamental – the elevation of  vices, notably selfishness and greed, to the status of  virtues. This was the consequence of  a cultural process which originated in Western 
Europe over the 17
th and 18th centuries � This conversion of  vice to 
virtue was, for Gandhi, the essence of  modern political economy �
What Gandhi posed as a counter was not a model or an ideology, 
but a moral framework for being truly civilized� Essentially, he 
rejected the claim – made by communists and capitalists alike – that improving our material conditions is the supreme goal� Instead, he The ‘modern’ 
which Gandhi 
critiqued was 
a process by 
which knowledge, 
science and 
economics were 
wrenched from 
their ethical 
and spiritual 
moorings – and 
set asunder from 
moral philosophy10Civilizational Gandhi
argued that all efforts to improve the human condition are bound 
to fail unless they put ‘dharma’, or a moral framework and a sense 
of  higher purpose, above the pursuit of  ‘arth’ (wealth) and ‘kama’ 
(pleasure) �[i]
Gandhi’s view of  civilization is thus a frame of  reference, or a 
lens, which focuses our attention on fundamental questions: What 
kind of  society do we want to build? What, essentially, is the good 
we seek?
A lack of  attention to such fundamentals might explain 
why the global discourse on the many crises we currently face, 
seems to go around in circles � Within India, both the economy 
and polity are in a state of  distress � More than six decades after 
independence, India remains at the bottom of  the United Nations’ Human Development Index (HDI) �
[ii] Twenty years of  economic 
liberalisation have expanded the size of  India’s middle class, but not raised the standard of  living for the overwhelming majority of  
Indians �
Globally, people are becoming more aware that a time of  
reckoning is imminent � They are slowly acknowledging that the 
global financial system is fundamentally flawed and not just going through a cyclical low � We are also more sceptical now about the 
ability of  the prevailing market culture to ensure even basic well-
being for the seven billion people who inhabit the earth�
At the same time, the human economy and nature’s eco-systems 
appear to be critically out of  sync � Despite an increasing urgency 
for trans-national cooperation, there are persistent fears about a clash of  civilizations – primarily between the West and the Islamic 
world, but also within multi-ethnic societies in large parts of  the  contemporary world�
[i] Arth refers to the domain of  material resources, not just accumulation of  wealth�  
Similarly, kama is not only the desire for the sensual, but desire per se, which can 
include the  desire for others to be happy �
[ii] The HDI is a composite of  indicators such as life expectancy, education and 
income �11Introduction
Viewing these realities through Gandhi’s lens, we find not 
managerial or ideological failures, but a crisis of  civilization itself � 
For Gandhi impels us to journey far up-stream of  contemporary 
problems � Instead of  merely pushing us to ask why development 
is slow, or why markets are not sufficiently inclusive, he draws our attention to re-examining the very definition of  ‘development’ and ‘progress’�
Gandhi’s exhortation that the earth has enough for everyone’s 
needs but not for everyone’s greed, has become a mantra for 
environmentalists and other social activists across the world� Even 
in the mainstream of  political and economic power, globally, there are now more people who recognise that a model of  growth that 
requires an endless increase of  consumption is probably doomed�
However, the core of  Gandhi’s concern was not the volume of  
how much we consume or how luxuriously we live � It is perhaps 
natural to want good food, clothes, comforts and pleasures � But 
is this what gives meaning to our life? Isn’t it the development 
of  our higher human faculties – a sense of  duty, responsibility, 
love, compassion – that gives us an anchor and purpose, thereby 
enriching both individual lives and society as a whole?
If  we work with this challenging frame of  reference, then 
civilization cannot be equated with the invention of  the wheel or 
sliced bread or the internet � Civilization, in Gandhi’s perspective, is 
that which shows us the path of  swaraj.
History textbooks in schools in India tell us that swaraj was 
Gandhi’s term for home-rule, which would make Indians rulers 
of  their own nation� This is only partly true � Gandhi tirelessly 
reiterated that the transfer of  power from Britain to India was a relatively small and short-term goal� The essence of  swaraj, or 
self-rule, is command over one’s own passions � Civilization is that 
which shows us the path of  right conduct or dharma – and the 
essence of  dharma is command over one’s self �
In the absence of  such rule over the self, Gandhi insisted, 
we will not be in a position to fully develop the positive values 12Civilizational Gandhi
that have emerged out of  the modern era – notably civil liberty, 
equality, rights, prospects for improving the economic conditions 
of  life, liberation of  women from traditional shackles, and religious 
toleration – all of  which he deeply valued�[iii]
Before venturing further into this exploration, it is important to 
draw a distinction between the historical Mohandas Karamchand 
Gandhi, who is a 20th century Indian persona, and the civilizational 
Gandhi, who is a global presence – a thinker posing discomforting questions and challenges well beyond his lifetime �
The historical Gandhi was born into a trader’s family in 
Porbandar, a small town in western India, in 1869� He was shot 
dead at point-blank range on his way to a prayer meeting in 1948 in 
Delhi� His 79 years, after a brief  period as a lawyer,
[iv] were mostly 
spent not just in fighting colonialism, but also in various campaigns 
to reform himself  and Indian society � Above all, Gandhi altered our 
concept of  change by demonstrating how an opponent – internal and external – can be won over by eschewing hatred�
This global apostle of  peace remains an inspirational figure  
today – though he is also criticised for various decisions and actions � 
Hindu nationalists blame him for not stopping the partition of  
[iii] Anthony Parel writes in his introduction to a special edition of  Gandhi’s Hind 
Swaraj: “A glimpse into Gandhi’s Western intellectual sources should go a long 
way towards correcting the view held by some that the Mahatma was opposed to Western civilization as such� Such a view is so simple as to be false � As Sir 
Ernest Barker puts it, he [Gandhi] was a ‘bridge and reconciler’� The breadth and depth of  his knowledge of  Western intellectual sources suggest that his attack was limited to certain unhealthy tendencies in modern Western civilization and that the attack was not motivated by any consideration of  narrow nationalism or anti-colonialism� On the contrary, in Hind Swaraj he joins forces with many concerned 
Western thinkers in the defence of  true civilizational values everywhere, East and West� He hoped for the day when England would reintegrate modernity within the framework of  traditional British culture �” [3]
[iv] Gandhi was called to the Bar in London in 1891� From 1894 to 1914, he 
practiced law in South Africa� Gandhi was debarred from the Inner Temple, a professional association of  barristers in London, in 1922, due to his leadership of  anti-colonial activities � He was posthumously reinstated in 1988� [4]13Introduction
India; Dalits blame him for being a patronising upper caste leader, 
and much worse �
No government office in India is complete without a token 
portrait of  Gandhi� But his ideas are barely referred to, and certainly not adopted, in the formulation of  economic policy � This is largely 
because Gandhi is perceived to be morally over-demanding, asking for too much goodness, and difficult to action in the “real world.”
It is time to set aside the image of  Gandhi as a saint aiming for a 
utopia� Instead, let us focus on the civilizational Gandhi – a thinker 
who challenges our imagination, expands the realm of  the possible 
and helps us to address chronic problems �
There are contemporary strivings for the kind of  modern which 
would be a “good idea” – one based on a more creative amalgam of  spirit and matter, dharma and wealth� Can these diverse endeavours 
contend with the will to command and wield power, which is also 
basic to the human condition?
“Civilization, in the real sense of  the term, consists not in the 
multiplication, but in the deliberate and voluntary reduction of  
wants.”
 
– M.K.Gandhi, 1921 [5]14I. Why is the ‘modern’ 
not a civilization?
“…They will learn the meaning of  the world civilization when 
they come back home and truly understand what their great master, 
Lao-tze, wanted to teach when he said: Those who have virtue attend 
to their obligations; those who have no virtue attend to their claims. 
...Progress which is not related to an inner ideal, but to an attraction 
which is external, seeks to satisfy our endless claims. But civilization 
which is an ideal gives us power and joy to fulfil our obligations.”  
– Rabindranath Tagore from a lecture on ‘Civilization 
and Progress’ delivered in China in 1924 [6]
During an extended stay in London in 1909, Gandhi engaged 
in intense conversations with budding young Indian 
revolutionaries living in Britain. He was disturbed to find that the aspiring revolutionaries expected that overthrowing British imperial power would alleviate their nation’s woes� They, in turn, 
were horrified to learn that Gandhi was more concerned about 
challenging “modern civilization �” It seemed absurd to them to 
doubt the miraculous powers and liberating potential of modernity �
In a twist of  irony, one of  the young men in that group of  
revolutionaries was Vinayak Damodar Savarkar who, 40 years later, was to stand trial for participating in the conspiracy to kill Gandhi� It is well-known that Gandhi’s assassin, Nathuram Godse, drew 
much of  his inspiration and motivation from Savarkar, who had 
become a leading Hindu nationalist ideologue �
[v]
Gandhi’s encounters with young revolutionaries in Britain 
drove him to spend his return voyage to South Africa scribbling 
[v] Savarkar was tried for the murder of  Gandhi and was acquitted by the court � 
Scholars have argued that this was due to a legal technicality �15Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
furiously on the ship’s stationery � When his right hand got tired, 
he continued with his left hand� The resulting tract, Hind Swaraj, 
did little to change the minds of  those young people � On the 
contrary, Gandhi seemed to be going out of  his way to outrage the sensibilities of  most of  his contemporaries, who welcomed the 
comforts and advances associated with the ‘modern’� [7]
As a passionately polemical text, Hind Swaraj supplied ample 
evidence for those who dismissed Gandhi as a delusional faddist 
who was unreasonably opposed to 
modern machines � For instance, Gandhi 
wrote: “Machinery is the chief  symbol of  
modern civilization� It represents a great 
sin�” [8]
Elsewhere he wrote: “Railways 
have also increased the frequency of  famines, because, owing to facility of  
means of  locomotion, people sell out their grain, and it is sent to the dearest 
markets � People become careless, and 
so the pressure of  famine increases � 
They accentuate the evil nature of  man� 
 
Bad men fulfil their evil designs with 
greater rapidity ���Good travels at snail’s 
pace – it can, therefore, have little to do with the railways �” [9]
Gandhi was not oblivious to the 
irony of  these utterances � After all, 
he too benefited from the many uses of  machines, and he was at that very moment on board a modern steamship � 
Gandhi’s famed punctuality meant that 
he was ruled by his watch, a symbol of  modernism� So it cannot be over-emphasised that Gandhi’s critique of  modernity was not a 
rejection of  either contemporary innovation or the exploration of  
new technological vistas �In Hind Swaraj, 
Gandhi answers 
a query about the 
validity of  even 
using a machine 
to print his words: 
‘This is one of  
those instances 
which demonstrate 
that sometimes 
poison is used to 
kill poison.’ Why 
should we not 
simply discard a 
text that contains 
such hyperbole? 
Why does Gandhi’s 
critique of  
modernity matter 
at all to our present 
and future?16Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
In Hind Swaraj, Gandhi answers a query about the validity of  
even using a machine to print his words: “This is one of  those 
instances which demonstrate that sometimes poison is used to kill 
poison� ” [10] Why should we not simply discard a text that contains 
such hyperbole? Why does Gandhi’s critique of  modernity matter at all to our present and future?
Firstly, because getting lost in extreme statements distracts from 
the substance of  Gandhi’s critique � And secondly, because in the 
remaining 40 years of  his life after that steamship voyage, Gandhi’s 
various thoughts, writings and actions posed challenges that have 
ripened and now become urgent � Gandhi made a clear distinction 
between swaraj as self-government, democratic governance, a good 
State – and swaraj as self-rule , or the quest for self-improvement and 
command over one’s own passions �
Freedom from British rule gave Indians self-government – and 
made the historical Gandhi the “Father of  the Nation� ” Despite 
political freedom, self-rule remains elusive � Without a vibrant 
culture of  rule over the self, it might be impossible to fulfil the 
promise of  truly democratic governance and a good State �
Gandhi realised that conjoining the two concepts of  swaraj is 
the basis of  being truly civilized� This made him a futuristic thinker 
who is now urgently relevant to the entire world�
I. i The crux of Gandhi’s critique
Gandhi rebelled against the specious claim that societies that are materially more powerful – with bigger factories 
and deadlier weapons – are at a higher stage of civilization � The 
England of Gandhi’s youth was a society in which colonialism was morally justified on the basis of superior ‘modern’ technology and 
institutions of governance � Sections of the Indian and Chinese 
elites had begun to concur with this view � The traditions of 
both these ancient cultures were often blamed for the material degradation that afflicted millions in this part of the world. This 
attitude persisted despite the knowledge that till the 19
th century, 17Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
India and China had produced more industrial goods than any 
other part of the world �
The American historian Will Durant was so shocked by 
these attitudes that, in 1930, he took time off  from writing his  
monumental work on the history of  civilization to write a detailed account of  why India was so poor � These conditions, Durant 
wrote in The Case for India, are not due to “���over-population and superstition, but to the most sordid and criminal exploitation of  one nation by another in all recorded history �” [11]
More recently, a study by the British economist Angus Maddison 
has shown that in 1000 AD, China’s and India’s combined share of  world Gross National Product (GNP) at purchasing power parity was approximately 52%; it was as high as 49% even in 1820� A 
combination of  colonial exploitation, de-industrialisation and the 
proliferation of  Western modes of  production reduced India and China to an 8% share of  global GNP by 1973� [12]
Gandhi’s attention was sharply focused on the misery caused 
by the de-industrialisation of  Indian society, and how this made nonsense of  the ‘civilising’ claims of  colonialism� Rejecting the worship of  material advancement as an end in itself  was Gandhi’s 
key insight � He argued that the modern version of  material 
advancement is a regression rather than a higher stage of  human 
evolution, because it displaces dharma from its primacy �
I. ii The role of dharma
Gandhi had been grappling with the somewhat elusive concept of dharma for much of his adult life � He took inspiration from 
his correspondence with Rajchandra Ravjibhai Mehta (1868-1901), a Gujarati Jain mystic who was born into a prominent merchant’s family �
What Mehta helped him to grasp, Gandhi later wrote, was that 
“dharma does not mean any particular creed or dogma� Nor does it 
mean reading or learning by rote books known as shastras  (sacred 18Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
texts) or even believing all that they say �” Rather, dharma is “a quality 
of  soul” present in every human being �
In other words, Gandhi defined dharma not as religion or any 
denominational affiliation, but as a moral framework through 
which “… we know our duty in human life and our true relation 
with other souls…dharma is the means [sadhana] by which we can 
know ourselves �” Therefore, no organised religion can claim to be 
a sole or special repository of  dharma� “We may accept this means [sadhana] from wherever we get it, whether from India or Europe 
or Arabia� ” [13]
By writing Hind Swaraj, Gandhi 
aimed to provide an updated conception of  dharma, suited for contemporary 
realities � The old notion of  dharma was 
closely tied to a rigid social and political hierarchy, which defined both duties 
and obligations � The present age needs 
not a preservation of  the status quo 
but a guide to fulfil the aspirations of  
an inclusive democratic citizenship – a visionary new “civic humanism” 
as Anthony Parel, editor of  a special 
edition of  Hind Swaraj, puts it� [14] He writes:
“Gandhi felt that the time had come 
to redefine the scope of  dharma to 
include notions of  citizenship, equality, liberty, fraternity and mutual assistance � 
And in Hind Swaraj he presents in simple language his notion of  such a redefined dharma, the vision of  a new Indian or Gandhian civic humanism, 
one that the Gita and the Ramayana had always contained in potentia, 
but something which Indian civilization had not actualized fully in practice � ���‘This is not a mere political book,’ Gandhi writes � ‘I 
have used the language of  politics, but I have really tried to offer a The old notion of  
dharma was closely 
tied to a rigid  
social and  
political hierarchy, 
which defined 
both duties and 
obligations. The 
present age needs 
not a preservation 
of  the status quo 
but a guide to  
fulfil the aspirations 
of  an inclusive 
democratic 
citizenship – a 
visionary new 
‘civic humanism’19Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
glimpse of  dharma� What is the meaning of  Hind Swaraj? It means 
rule of  dharma or Ramarajya� We may read the Gita or the Ramayana 
or Hind Swaraj� But what we have to learn from them is desire for 
the welfare of  others’� ”
Gandhi was also drawing on 
the concept of  ‘purushartha’, 
which is the foundation of  multiple spiritual traditions of  the Indian sub-continent � The 
four purushartha, or pursuits 
of  life, are dharma, artha, kama, moksha� Dharma is a moral and spiritual framework� This forms the basis for artha – the pursuit 
of  power, property and security, and for kama – seeking pleasure 
and the avoidance of  pain. The fulfilment of  artha and kama on the 
basis of  dharma leads to spiritual enlightenment and liberation or 
moksha�
[vi]
[vi] Anthony Parel writes in a footnote to Hind Swaraj: “ ‘India is still, somehow 
or other, sound at the foundation’: This is the bedrock of  Gandhi’s defence of  
Indian civilization in Hind Swaraj – that artha and kama should be pursued within the framework of  dharma� In modern civilization artha and kama, according to Gandhi, assert their autonomy from dharma� ” The concept of  purushartha depends 
on a distinction between Self  as atman – that is the imperishable, eternal, spiritual substratum of  the being of  every individual� And Self  as dehin – the embodied spatio-temporal self, composed of  body, senses, mind and soul� Parel writes: “The self  that is directly involved in politics – in the pursuit of  swaraj – is the 
dehin� Though the dehin’s ultimate end is self-realisation or atmadarshan, it is the 
intermediate ends of  the dehin, comprehensively summed up under the headings of  artha (power, property and security) and kama (pleasure and the avoidance of  
pain) that are the proper objects of  the active life � The correct pursuit of  these 
ends requires that they are pursued within the framework of  dharma� But the dehin  
can do so only if  the mind maintains its freedom and exercises control over itself  and the senses � Thus, the mind emerges as the key faculty in Gandhi’s political 
philosophy, swaraj being the rule of  the mind over itself  and the passions � The 
possession of  a disciplined mind – free from an inordinate desire for property, pleasure and power – is the prerequisite for the proper practice of  satyagraha, the 
non-violent way of  achieving home rule � But, as Gandhi argued, the ideal of  swaraj 
can be achieved in modern times only in a united Indian nation or praja. Swaraj and home rule must meet in a newly-constituted Indian praja� ” [15]The mind emerges as the 
key faculty in Gandhi’s 
political philosophy, swaraj 
being the rule of  the mind 
over itself  and the passions20Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
I. iii The sword of ethics
Observe, Gandhi wrote, that it is the nature of the mind to seek 
more and more of what it craves and yet remain unsatisfied. 
Knowing that the more we indulge our passions, the more unbridled they become, Gandhi argued, our ancestors realised that voluntary limits on indulgences are the key to happiness – which, 
after all, is largely a mental condition �
[vii][16]
According to Gandhi, the Indic civilization was based on the 
knowledge that “����kings and their swords were inferior to the 
sword of  ethics, and they, [our ancestors] therefore, held the sovereigns of  the earth to be inferior to the sword of  ethics, and …to the Rishis and the Fakirs � ���This nation had courts, lawyers 
and doctors, but they were all within bounds �” [17]
This was why doctors and lawyers featured prominently in 
Hind Swaraj� Gandhi believed that modernity had ‘freed’ these 
professions from the restraints required by traditional morality � 
Doctors become complicit in a culture of  over-indulgence and 
benefit from the resultant plethora of  illnesses. Lawyers, instead of  working as conciliators, benefit from the proliferation of  disputes.
 
In 1915, the Sinhalese philosopher and historian Ananda Coomaraswamy developed this critique in further detail by 
identifying a fundamental difference between traditional morality, 
with its spiritual anchor, and the modern view of  politics:
“The modern politician considers that idealism in politics is 
unpractical; time enough, he thinks, to deal with social misfortunes 
when they arise � The same outlook may be recognized in the fact 
that modern medicine lays greater stress on cure than on prevention, 
i�e� endeavours to protect against unnatural conditions rather than 
to change the social environment � The Western sociologist is apt 
[vii] Gandhi’s use of  the term ‘mental’ can lead to quite a philosophical muddle � 
Virtually all the spiritual traditions of  the Indian sub-continent suggest that 
happiness ( ananda) is our nature � Happiness cannot be sought from the outside 
but must simply be uncovered within� The Yoga Sutras are dedicated to removing inner obstacles to facilitate this uncovering of  intrinsic ananda�21Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
to say: ‘The teachings of  religion and philosophy may or may not 
be true, but in any case they have no significance for the practical 
reformer �’ The Brahmans, on the contrary, considered all activity 
not directed in accordance with a consistent theory of  the meaning and purpose of  life as supremely unpractical� ” [18]
I. iv Cooperation versus competition
Gandhi identified a fallacious maxim at the core of modern 
political economy and the related development of technology � 
This fallacy, Gandhi wrote, was the idea that “might is right,” which was validated by the claim that “survival of the fittest” is a law of the natural world � In the early 20
th century these were 
pervasive and seemingly all-powerful 
concepts� The ‘law’ of competition 
was deemed to be the best because it ensures the survival of the fittest. Vast 
concentrations of wealth and power, 
with their concomitant and crushing inequities, were actually lauded as 
evidence of the inevitability of “survival 
of the fittest” and “might is right.” In a relatively subtler form this idea is 
still alive – for example, compromises 
on human rights and environmental standards are justified because 
dominance in the global marketplace is 
given primary importance �
Gandhi was not alone in challenging this Social Darwinism in 
its various forms � Peter Kropotkin, the Russian geographer and 
philosopher, worked extensively in the field in the late 19
th century, 
and exposed the falsehood of  these popular beliefs � After examining 
wildlife in Siberia for five years, Kropotkin wrote that he had failed to find evidence of  the bitter struggle for the means of  existence which Darwinians claimed to be the dominant driver of  evolution� 
Kropotkin found ample evidence for natural selection, but he said Gandhi’s diagnosis 
was that false 
assumptions, like 
survival of  the 
fittest, lie at the 
heart of  modern 
culture. Dynamism 
is lauded as an end 
in itself, which leads 
to a corresponding 
undervaluing of  
any higher goal22Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
its driving force was cooperation, not competition� Those who are 
most inclined and able to cooperate and adapt are the ‘fittest’. [19]
Gandhi’s diagnosis was that false assumptions, like survival 
of  the fittest, lie at the heart of  modern culture. Dynamism is thus lauded as an end in itself, which leads to a corresponding 
undervaluing, or complete neglect, of  any higher goal�
Therefore, Gandhi described modern culture as being 
‘centrifugal’ in nature � He said, “A civilization or a condition in 
which all the forces fly away from the centre must necessarily be without a goal, whereas those who converge to a point have always 
a goal� ” [20] By contrast, Gandhi regarded the civilization nurtured 
on the Indian sub-continent as centripetal – inwardly contemplative 
and adaptive �
Above all, Gandhi traced the darkness at the heart of  modern 
systems to the de-linking of  means from ends � He realised that 
means are never just instrumental, they are always ends-in-the-making � In Gandhi’s time, the physical and economic violence 
of  colonialism was justified in the service of  a higher goal – the 
absorption of  supposedly blighted parts of  the world into modern civilization� Today, the social and environmental destruction caused 
by the misconceived projects and policies of  development is still 
justified as a necessary evil to facilitate growth and progress.
Therefore, Gandhi condemned the practice of  vivisection, or 
surgery conducted on living organisms for experimental purposes � 
He was convinced that a system of  science and technology that deliberately inflicts pain on living beings can only lead to violent outcomes � The killing factories of  Auschwitz and the brutality 
of  Hiroshima-Nagasaki were, for Gandhi, not aberrations but the inevitable outcome of  the modern paradigm of  science � Our 
species has a long history of  cruelty, but there is no precedent for cold-blooded killing-factories or for the experimental use of  weapons of  mass destruction on entirely civilian populations � [21]
“I abhor vivisection with my whole soul� I detest the 
unpardonable slaughter of  innocent life in the name of  science 23Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
and humanity so-called, and all the scientists’ discoveries 
stained with innocent blood I count of  no consequence �  
If  the circulation of  blood theory could not have been discovered without vivisection, the human kind could well have done without 
it� And I see the day clearly dawning when the honest scientist of  
the west will put limitations upon the present methods of  pursuing 
knowledge � 
“Future measurements will take note not only of  the human 
family, but of  all that lives and even as we are slowly but surely discovering that it is an error to suppose that Hindus can thrive upon the degradation of  a fifth of  themselves or that peoples of  the west can rise or live upon the exploitation and degradation of  
the eastern and African nations, so shall we realise in the fullness 
of  time, that our dominion over the lower order of  creation is not 
for their slaughter, but for their benefit equally with ours. For I am 
as certain that they are endowed with a soul as that I am� ” [22]
Gandhi’s clarity on the relationship between means and ends is 
now seen as one of  the most important contributions to libertarian 
theory – which gives primary importance to freedom, liberty and 
voluntary association, and envisages a larger role for society than the State �
British philosopher and historian Peter Marshall has examined 
the implications of  Gandhi’s assertion that if  we concentrate on the right means, the desirable ends will automatically follow: “By acting here and now as if  we are free agents capable of  self-rule, 
we actually bring about the free society rather than seeing it as 
some distant goal� His [Gandhi’s] non-violent revolution therefore does not involve the seizure of  power but the transformation of  
everyday life and relationships �” 
[viii] [23]
[viii] Gandhi is now regarded as an anarchist philosopher who drew on India’s 
spiritual traditions, which hold the human being to be an inherently divine being, 
capable of  perfection through the rigorous practice of  moral norms � In this frame, 
the eternal life was not an eternity in time but instead, as Sant Kabir says, “More than all else, do I cherish at heart that love which makes me to live a limitless life in this world� ” [24]24Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
I. v Unto this last and universal principles
His clarity about the importance of means over ends formed 
the basis of Gandhi’s diagnosis that the modern was an asuri 
shakti,  a demonic power � He found the utilitarian ethic of aiming to 
seek the greatest good of the greatest number inherently flawed, for it would always demand that some minority must pay the price of 
progress� The only worthwhile goal, Gandhi insisted, is Sarvodaya 
– the welfare of every last person � This conviction was partly based 
on the British philosopher John Ruskin’s
[ix] book Unto This Last  – 
reading this book was a turning point in Gandhi’s life �[x]
Gandhi was confident that Sarvodaya is an attainable goal, 
because he emphatically rejected the idea that the natural human 
state is “nasty, brutish and short” as claimed by Thomas Hobbes, 
the 17th century British philosopher � On the contrary, he had a deep 
conviction that the natural state of  human beings is to cooperate, 
cohere and live in peace – wars and conflicts are breaks in the 
working of  “soul force �”
Conventional historiography offered a record of  the rise 
and fall of  empires, with all the associated brutality � Gandhi 
looked at the past of  our species differently – he detected at the core of  every culture a longing for higher freedom� 
 
It was on the basis of  this intuition, rather than scholarship, that Gandhi outlined universal foundational principles for being truly 
civilized. He offered a contemporary definition of  dharma – self-
knowledge, duty ( farajj), morality ( niti) and mastery over the mind 
and physical senses � [26]
[ix] Ruskin’s was not a lone voice � Many of  the poems and paintings by William 
Blake lamented the suffering unleashed by modern industry and the corresponding 
loss of  spirit � Gandhi’s seminal achievement was in elaborating this critique and 
making it the foundation of  his political action�
[x] Gandhi translated Unto This Last as Sarvodaya and paraphrased the key principles 
as: (a) The good of  the individual is contained in the good of  all; (b) A lawyer’s work has the same value as the barber’s, inasmuch as all have the same right of  earning their livelihood from their work; (c) A life of  labour, as a tiller of  the soil or a handicrafts-maker, is the life worth living � [25]25Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
This true civilization, based on dharma, is clearly not possible 
if  we let the profit-motive decide everything, nor is it possible by 
forcibly mandating equitable distribution of  assets or by turning 
all factories into public property � The failures of  both unfettered 
market capitalism and state-communism are now well-established� But much of  the contemporary discourse is still stuck in negotiating spaces between markets and State – and more recently there is some celebration of  “social enterprise �”
Sarvodaya as universal well-being remains a widely lauded goal 
in principle � But most people think it is unattainable, and Gandhi’s 
definition of  dharma is not credited as being a practical basis for 
engaging with real-life markets or politics, for various reasons: 
Firstly, Gandhi’s view of  human nature is considered overly 
optimistic; secondly, the distinction between self-government and self-rule is accepted but regarded as being difficult to put into 
action; thirdly, asserting the primacy of  dharma and means over 
ends triggers fears that one would not be able to survive, let alone 
thrive, in the fiercely competitive realities of  our times.
Let us examine these fears �
One, there is now an open disquiet about the deeply negative 
view of  human nature which is at the base of  contemporary market culture � The quest by Microsoft’s founder, Bill Gates, for 
a more “caring capitalism” is one small indicator of  this unrest � 
Terms like “creative capitalism” and “conscious capitalism” now have a fledgling presence in the global discourse, because there are both individuals and companies which now reject selfishness as the basis of  progress � Some of  these are new enterprises – like Whole 
Foods and Trader Joe’s in the U �S�, Marico and Fabindia in India, 
and others are long-standing enterprises like the Tata group � [27]
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s work at the interface of  economics 
and ethics has helped to prepare the ground for these gradual shifts � 
Sen has traced many of  our contemporary woes to the fact that conventional economic theory defined rationality not so much as 
internally-consistent choices, but as a maximisation of  self-interest � 26Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
“Universal selfishness as actuality may well be false,” Sen wrote in 
his book On Ethics and Economics , “but universal selfishness as a 
requirement of  rationality is patently absurd� ” [28]
Two, the distinction between self-government and self-rule is 
not quite as lofty as it might seem� At one extreme, a longing for 
self-rule gives rise to initiatives such as the Voluntary Simplicity 
movement, which originated in the U �S� and has adherents across 
the world� This is a loose network of  individuals and groups seeking to limit their attachment to material belongings and to anchor their 
sense of  happiness in community activity and wider social goals �
Such efforts are also a response to the fact that affluence has 
not reduced emotional and psychological maladies � Instead, the 
maladies are reaching epidemic proportions amid material plenty 
– denying people basic happiness even in the here and now, let alone in a longer-term moksha� According to the World Health 
Organisation, depression afflicts an estimated 121 million
[xi] 
people worldwide and is expected to be the second largest cause of  disability by the year 2020� [29]
The Wikipedia entry on Voluntary Simplicity credits both 
Gandhi and David Henry Thoreau as two of  the major inspirations 
for people treading this path� The movement derives its name from 
a 1981 book by American activist-intellectual Duane Elgin titled 
‘Voluntary Simplicity: Toward a Way of  Life That Is Outwardly Simple, Inwardly Rich’. [32]
Supporters of  this approach have pointed out that Voluntary 
Simplicity is not about advocating or romanticising poverty, or even a denial of  bodily comforts � It is about living with balance 
– a balance between our needs and wants, and between what we 
consume and its impact on other people’s lives and on nature’s 
[xi] According to a 2011 report by the National Center for Health Statistics, 
the rate of  anti-depressant use in U �S among teens and adults (people ages 12 
and older) increased by almost 400% between 1988–1994 and 2005–2008� [30]  
The global anti-depressant drug market reached sales of  almost $11 billion in 
2008� [31]27Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
eco-systems � However, the key motivation is not conservation of  
nature, but a reaffirmation of  what really matters in life. Elgin 
expresses this by quoting Thoreau: “The price of  anything is the 
amount of  life you have to pay for it �” [33]
Since the early 1990s, Schumacher College at Devon in Britain 
has become a hub not only for thinkers and activists of  this grid, but also for people from different walks of  life who are seeking holistic answers � Politically, some of  this energy has also begun to converge 
at the annual Degrowth conferences in different parts of  Europe � 
These conferences attract a wide range of  radical academics as well as activists, who are all seeking a model of  economic well-being that would not depend upon endless growth in Gross National 
Product (GNP) �
[xii]
This partly explains why there is now so much interest in 
concepts like Gross National Happiness, first formulated by the King of  Bhutan in the early 1970s � In the West there is growing 
interest in developing Genuine Progress Indicators (GPI) as a 
measure of  actual social and psychological well-being, and asserting 
the primacy of  this measure over the conventional growth metric 
of  GNP � [35, 36]
[xii] Research & Degrowth is a Barcelona-based academic association 
dedicated to research, raising awareness and organising events on the topic 
of  “degrowth� ” According to their website: “Sustainable degrowth is a 
downscaling of  production and consumption that increases human well-being and enhances ecological conditions and equity on the planet � It calls for 
a future where societies live within their ecological means, with open, localized economies and resources more equally distributed through new forms of  democratic institutions � Such societies will no longer have to ‘grow or die’�
 
Material accumulation will no longer hold a prime position in the population’s cultural imaginary. The primacy of  efficiency will be substituted by a focus on sufficiency, and innovation will no longer focus on technology for technology’s sake but will concentrate on new social and technical arrangements that will enable us to live convivially and frugally � Degrowth does not only challenge the centrality 
of  GDP as an overarching policy objective but proposes a framework for transformation to a lower and sustainable level of  production and consumption, a shrinking of  the economic system to leave more space for human cooperation and ecosystems �” [34]28Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
Struggles across the world – from Tunisia to Egypt and even 
Occupy Wall Street – invoke Gandhi when they demand self-
government. But most of  these societies are finding that the 
much harder work begins after colonialism or some other kind 
of  repressive regime has been overthrown – the arduous work of  
fostering a civic culture in which people are as, or more, passionate about fulfilling their responsibilities, their larger social obligations, as they are about asserting their rights �
For example, a new anti-corruption law in India might be 
useful� But serious change clearly depends on a social and cultural movement which inspires people to shun corrupt practices in their daily life � Much 
of  this everyday corruption is driven by a survival instinct – by an argument that if  I don’t use whatever power I have to 
my advantage, someone else will take 
advantage of  me � That may explain why 
the most oft-quoted words of  Gandhi are now “Be the change you want to see” – many people seem to wistfully long to live by this inspiration�
Three, the primacy of  means over 
ends can be asserted more as a practical imperative rather than a moral mandate � A 
poignant illustration of  this is the end of  Gandhi’s life � Did Godse succeed? Or did his means undermine 
his goal?
In political and practical terms, Gandhi’s assassination put 
Hindu nationalists on the defensive for at least four decades � 
Killing Gandhi may still prove to be a permanent hurdle for those who want India to be a Hindu state, as opposed to a secular state �
It is only partly true that the assassination was a crime of  passion 
born out of  Godse’s rage over Gandhi’s alleged favouritism towards 
Muslims and Pakistan� On the basis of  his scrutiny of  Godse’s The primacy of  
means over ends 
can be  
asserted more  
as a  
practical 
imperative 
rather than a 
moral mandate. 
A poignant 
illustration of  this 
is the end of   
Gandhi’s life29Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
testimony in court, the sociologist and psychologist Ashis Nandy 
has offered a different explanation� 
As a self-avowed rationalist and modernist, Godse felt that 
Gandhi’s idea of  a soul force and morality in politics was anti-scientific. Godse acknowledged that by killing Gandhi he committed 
patricide and did so unwillingly � But he was also convinced that 
eliminating Gandhi was necessary to secure the modern project 
of  statecraft and rationality, without which the newly-independent India might perish� [37]
Godse need not have bothered� Both India and the world were 
clearly not ready for the challenges posed by Gandhi. Sixty-five years after the historical Gandhi’s departure, India is a society and 
economy in the throes of  pursuing material gain as an end in itself; 
yet dreams of  India becoming a major economic power on the world stage seem, at best, fragile �
In India’s entrenched pyramid of  social and economic 
structures, the majority of  people remain at the bottom, and a poverty of  mind, body and spirit is rampant at all levels of  the pyramid� Secondly, and more importantly, the template on which India is striving to succeed in the global economy is inherently 
flawed Keynes’ exhortation that foul must continue to be 
 
fair for another hundred years was based on the assumption that 
the human species would solve its economic and material problems 
in that period�
Yes, there is a larger middle class in the world today than ever 
before � But most of  the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 
are likely to miss their deadline in 2015 – even though the MDG’s 2012 report showed a decline in the number of  people living in 
extreme poverty – for the first time since global records on poverty began to be kept � [38]
At the same time, the 2011 Human Development Report of  the 
UNDP noted that even in countries where living standards have been rising over the last few decades, there are signs of  reversal because environmental deterioration and social inequalities 30Civilizational Gandhi Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
continue to intensify �[xiii] [39]
It is critical to note that the future of  those at the middle or 
top of  the global pyramid is also uncertain� Everyone will have to 
confront the consequences of  climate change and an acceleration of  environmental crises � In this context, people are more willing to 
doubt the claim that economic dynamism depends on greed – or even narrow self-interest� 
In 2006, the British economist Nicholas Stern identified climate 
change as the biggest “market failure” in 
history � In other words, everyone single-
mindedly pursuing their own interest, 
without a higher purpose, has not led to 
a sustainable optimum outcome �
Most of  the mainstream global 
discourse in response to both the 
financial and environmental crises, is 
still rotating around either managerial 
issues or the intricacies of  the equation between markets and the State – with a sprinkling of  philanthropy and NGOs 
thrown in� That is largely because 
for more than two centuries modern 
thinkers – adherents of  Smith and Marx alike – have convincingly 
argued that human betterment requires not moral effort but an alteration of  the material conditions of  life � Altering this mindset 
may be the most critical shift that is now required�
It is vital to note that Gandhi is not a loner on this journey � The 
longing for an economically and morally efficient social system is 
[xiii] According to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), “About 1�7 billion 
people in the 109 countries covered by the MPI – a third of  their population – live 
in multidimensional poverty. That is, at least 33% of  the indicators reflect acute deprivation in health, education and standard of  living � This exceeds the estimated 
1�3 billion people in those countries who live on $1�25 a day or less (though it is below the number of  those who live on $2 or less) �” [40]For more than two 
centuries modern 
thinkers – adherents 
of  Smith and 
Marx alike – have 
convincingly 
argued that human 
betterment requires 
not moral effort 
but an alteration 
of  the material 
conditions of  life31Why is the ‘modern’ not a civilization?
ancient � Keynes too was preoccupied by this concern� In 1930, at 
the peak of  the Great Depression, he looked wistfully into the 
future and hoped that:
 “We shall be able to rid ourselves of  many of  the pseudo-
moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of  the most distasteful of  human 
qualities into the position of  the highest virtues � We shall be able 
to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value � The 
love of  money as a possession – as distinguished from the love of  
money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of  life – will be 
recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of  those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one 
hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease � All 
kinds of  social customs and economic practices, affecting the 
distribution of  wealth and of  economic rewards and penalties, 
which we now maintain at all costs, however distasteful and unjust 
they may be in themselves, because they are tremendously useful 
in promoting the accumulation of  capital, we shall then be free, at 
last, to discard� ” [41]
Challenging and then reorienting the relationship between 
means and ends is the essence of  Gandhi’s vision� What if  pursuing 
economic necessity as an end in itself  never works? What if  it keeps 
us perpetually stuck with the “distasteful and unjust”?32Civilizational Gandhi
II. Peace
Sometime in October 2001, a laminated letter appeared on the 
gate of a small park in downtown Manhattan � The letter-writer 
had lost her husband in the terrorist strike on the World Trade Centre a month earlier � Please, let there be no more killing, she 
pleaded � The letter had been published by the Chicago Tribune 
and posted at the park’s gate by an unknown person �
Even in that moment of  deep personal loss, this widow seemed 
to be equally anguished by the claim that bombing another country back to the stone age would serve as justice �
[xiv] Her plea echoed the 
phrase made famous by Gandhi: “An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind� ”
Her conviction must have resonated strongly with others bereaved 
by the 9/11 attacks, for many subsequently joined a campaign to establish a Department of  Peace within the U �S� government � 
Many also rallied together in 2006 to celebrate a hundred years of  Satyagraha – it was on September 11, 1906, that Gandhi first made a public appeal for non-violent civil disobedience � [43]
Gandhi is now a natural inspiration and inevitable symbol for 
humanitarian efforts in favour of  peace and non-violence across 
the world� But we must look closely at the deeper challenges he 
posed� Do we want a peace born out of  tolerance – perhaps even 
driven by exhaustion with violence? Or do we want a peace that is 
the means for a much greater purpose – enabling mutual creativity 
of  diverse races, faiths and nations in the onward journey of  civilization?
[xiv] The idea or imagery of  bombing a country back to the stone age was 
commonly referred to in conversations among ordinary people � In 2006, President 
Pervez Musharraf  of  Pakistan said in an interview that after the 9/11 attacks U �S� 
Deputy Secretary of  State Richard Armitage had threatened to bomb Pakistan 
“back to the Stone Age” unless it joined the fight against al-Qaeda. [42]33Peace
Working for such a greater purpose is possible only if  we do 
not equate civilization merely with identity, with affiliations which 
give us a sense of  ethnic belonging � We could instead experience 
civilization as a framework which enables us to define and explore ‘purpose’�
II. i A different kind of dialogue
In January 1993, I visited the temple known as Krishna Janmasthan 
in Mathura, along with a young activist of the Rashtriya 
Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organisation � Right 
beside a relatively small structure that houses what is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Krishna, stands a temple four or five floors 
high, built perhaps in the last 50 years. Directly behind this edifice 
is a mosque of older vintage and somewhat grander proportions�
It troubled the RSS activist that the sight of  an imposing 
mosque beside the temple did not bother me � On the contrary, I 
attempted to explain, it is a reassuring sight � For me, the adjacent 
houses of  worship represent the richness of  overlapping cultures and co-existence that is the essence of  India� But just as I could not 
understand the outrage of  that young man, he could not fathom 
how I could view those neighbouring houses of  worship as a symbol of  beauty and cultural strengths �
At the time I schooled myself  to accept that each of  us is wired 
differently – what for me is the beauty of  multicultural co-existence is to another a symbol of  humiliation that motivates revenge � A 
few months later, there was a buzz about a new phrase – “The 
Clash of  Civilizations �” Its proponent, the American academician 
Samuel Huntington, seemed to be saying that the future was going 
to be driven by that young man’s outrage � Huntington wrote:
“It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of  conflict 
in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic � The great divisions among humankind and the 
dominating source of  conflict will be cultural. Nation states will 
remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal 34Civilizational Gandhi
conflicts of  global politics will occur between nations and groups 
of  different civilizations � The clash of  civilizations will dominate 
global politics � The fault lines between civilizations will be the 
battle lines of  the future �” [44]
When the World Trade Centre was attacked on September 11, 
2001, many people in the media and in politics saw it as a validation of  Huntington’s predictions � The tragedy of  the terrorist strike 
was made even more poignant because it occurred in the very year that the United Nations had designated for a Dialogue of  
Civilizations � This was quickly obscured as the “War on Terror” 
came to be presented as a defence of  the more civilized versus 
the barbaric. Avowals by senior American public figures in favour 
of  multiculturalism do not alter the 
reality that this war is perceived as a conflict between the modern (also 
Christian and Western), versus the 
relatively ‘backward’ elements of  the 
East, who tend to be anti-modern 
and also Muslim� [45]
In this context, what is the 
challenge of  peace? It is easy 
enough to look wistfully towards 
Gandhi and his reaffirmation that “love and non-violence” are as old 
as the hills � This truth clearly did not 
save the victims of  9/11, or those 
who have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in terrorist attacks across the world — like the 
one that shook India in November 2008�
And yet, it is deeply significant that the practice of  non-violence 
has acquired a global resonance in our times � From the streets of  
North Africa to Wall Street, the efficacy of  non-violence as a mode 
of  dissent and protest is powerfully established – even if  many of  those engaged in these activities do so more out of  pragmatism 
than moral conviction� From the streets of  
North Africa to Wall

of  non-violence as a 
mode of  dissent and 
protest is powerfully 
established – even 
if  many of  those 
engaged in these 
activities do so more 
out of  pragmatism 
than moral conviction35Peace
Violent protest inevitably invites much more violent retaliation 
by the State, whereas even the harshest regimes find it daunting to 
suppress non-violent protest �
Protestors across the world are tapping into this generic truth 
and drawing on the methods developed by Gandhi� In that sense they are inheritors of  the strategies initiated by the historical 
Gandhi�
Over the past few decades, there have been 67 transitions 
across the world from authoritarian regimes to varying degrees 
of  democratic governance � A study by the Washington-based 
think-tank Freedom House indicates that the vast majority of  
these transitions were the result of  non-violent action and other 
forms of  civil disobedience deployed by democratic civil society 
organisations � 
[xv] [46]
But what is the relevance of  Gandhi’s vision in the face of  
intractable conflicts within a society and between nations – be it 
Hindu-Muslim, Christian-Muslim, Shia-Sunni, Iran-USA, India-
Pakistan? Invoking Gandhi in such situations seems unrealistically 
[xv] Another study of  more than 300 struggles for self-determination against 
colonialism, military occupation, and colonial rule over the past century has shown 
that non-violent struggles have a much greater likelihood of  success � This study, 
by Maria Stephan and Erica Chenowith, published in the journal International Security, shows that major non-violent campaigns have been successful 53% of  the time, compared with 26% success for violent resistance campaigns � Stephan and 
Chenowith offer two reasons for this: “First, a campaign’s commitment to non-violent methods enhances its domestic and international legitimacy and encourages more broad-based participation in the resistance, which translates into increased pressure being brought to bear on the target � Recognition of  the challenge group’s 
grievances can translate into greater internal and external support for that group and alienation of  the target regime, undermining the regime’s main sources of  political, economic, and even military power � “Second, whereas governments 
easily justify violent counterattacks against armed insurgents, regime violence against non-violent movements is more likely to backfire against the regime. 
 
Potentially sympathetic publics perceive violent militants as having maximalist or extremist goals beyond accommodation, but they perceive non-violent resistance groups as less extreme, thereby enhancing their appeal and facilitating the extraction of  concessions through bargaining �” [47]36Civilizational Gandhi
idealistic not merely to those in power, but also to many ‘ordinary’ 
people � Gandhi’s prescriptions are dismissed as being too morally 
and psychologically demanding �
In these deeply troubled times, a Dialogue of  Civilizations 
seems like an obviously good idea� And yet, oddly enough, such 
a dialogue might be counter-intuitive � This is because the key 
problem is not a clash of  civilizations, but a false and arbitrary 
partitioning of  civilizations � In the dominant discourse, civilization 
is that which defines “weural identity – it is that which enables us 
to process foundational questions: “Why am I here?” and “What is 
the purpose of  life?”
In our times, the quest for peace, within societies and between 
nations, takes us to the spaces between these two very different approaches � It also compels us to look beyond the comforting and 
saintly presence of  Gandhi as an apostle of  peace, love and non-
violence. It might even empower us to grapple more defiantly with 
seemingly intractable conflicts.
II. ii Civilizations as merging oceans
Soon after the attacks of 9/11, the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said wrote a scathing article titled The Clash of Ignorance,  
in which he criticised Huntington for being more of an ideologist and less of a scholar � This resulted, Said wrote, in overlooking the 
internal dynamics and plurality of every civilization:
“�� or for the fact that the major contest in most modern 
cultures concerns the definition or interpretation of  each culture, or for the unattractive possibility that a great deal of  demagogy and downright ignorance is involved in presuming to speak for a whole 
religion or civilization� No, the West is the West, and Islam Islam� ”
Civilizations and identities, Said argued, do not take shape as 
sealed-off  entities, they are a consequence of  myriad currents and 
counter currents � History is marked as much by wars of  religion 
and imperial conquest as exchange, cross-fertilisation and sharing � 37Peace
Said, who was a professor of  comparative literature at Columbia 
University, urged that we visualise history as an ocean instead of  
trying to divide it with artificial barriers:
“These are tense times, but it is better to think in terms of  
powerful and powerless communities, the secular politics of  reason and ignorance, and universal principles of  justice and injustice, 
than to wander off  in search of  vast abstractions that may give 
momentary satisfaction but little self-knowledge or informed analysis �”[48]
Similarly, Amartya Sen has cautioned 
us about the danger of  seeing people as belonging to one civilization or another � 
He writes: “Civilizational partitioning is a pervasively intrusive phenomenon in social analysis, stifling other – richer 
– ways of  seeing people � It lays the 
foundations for misunderstanding nearly 
everyone in the world, even before going on to the drumbeats of  civilizational clash� ”
Moreover, Sen said, “Theories of  civilizational clash have often 
provided allegedly sophisticated foundations of  crude and coarse 
popular beliefs � Cultivated theory can bolster uncomplicated 
bigotry �” [49]
Gandhi was convinced that contact between different cultures 
is healthy and mutually beneficial. In essence, this is why he was killed� Nathuram Godse, Gandhi’s assassin, said his action was necessary because ‘Hindu’ India would otherwise have had to 
face two enemies – Pakistan outside and Gandhi inside � Godse 
and his fellow conspirators also wanted free India to be a modern European-style nation-state based on a singular categorisation of  
the entire subcontinent as a Hindu nation� From their perspective, Gandhi’s insistence on honouring, even celebrating, spiritual and ethnic diversity, and intensive cultural interrelations, was anathema�Gandhi was 
convinced that 
contact between 
different cultures 
is healthy and 
mutually beneficial. 
In essence, this is 
why he was killed38Civilizational Gandhi
II. iii A mind not ‘halved by a horizon’
Multiple, overlapping identities have continued to thrive in 
India after Gandhi � It is also true that since the late 1980s, 
many Hindus and Muslims have become more polarised � And yet 
dialogues, like my exchange with the RSS activist in Mathura, are also a reality � Such conversations aim to draw upon the strengths 
in our cultural and spiritual heritage � More recently the Mumbai-
based civic group Citizens for Peace (CfP) has expanded the scope of such dialogue through an initiative called ‘PeaceTalks’ � 
[xvi]
How does all this help us to grapple with the harsh realities of  
the world we live in?
One, dialogues can be fruitful if  they are based not on defining 
peace as the absence of  violence, but rather as necessary and universal well-being and mutual creativity �
Two, when we expand the space for recognising and appreciating 
overlapping identities and affiliations, there is a greater chance of  
finding some common ground. This can potentially be the ground 
for addressing points of  conflict and disagreement.
Three, it is important to firmly oppose all forms of  retributive 
vengeance � Across the world, societies do, in principle, acknowledge 
the futility of  “an eye for an eye” model of  justice � But what do we 
do in situations where the people of  one group have been brutally oppressed and abused by another group?
The post-apartheid regime in South Africa offered an answer 
to this question� Instead of  opting for a Nuremberg-style court of  justice, the South African leadership instituted a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) � Some South Africans challenged 
this decision, which they felt would short-circuit formal justice � A 
reconciliatory approach was also antithetical to the conventional 
[xvi] PeaceTalks is a part of  CfP’s Secular Rethink project – a dialogue-based 
process of  asking how we, as Indians, can live our lives peacefully alongside others 
who eat, speak, think or pray differently from us � [50]39Peace
approach to human rights, which is based on a simplistic division 
of  victims and perpetrators �
Two decades later, the TRC is acknowledged as one of  the key 
steps by which post-apartheid South Africa avoided a protracted civil war � The TRC approach is certainly complex� Both in South 
Africa and in Ireland, where it was also applied, it has not fully healed the wounds of  deep injustices � But it did open spaces to 
acknowledge wrongs and move on to a future in which the injustices can be corrected�
For instance, Amartya Sen’s life was shaped by his experience of  
murder and communal riots in Bengal in 1944� As an 11-year-old boy, Sen recalls, 
he could not do much for Kader Mia, a 
mortally injured Muslim stranger who stumbled into Sen’s family’s garden� But 
that experience inspired in Sen a life-long 
commitment to resist the miniaturisation of  human beings: “I imagine another 
universe, not beyond our reach, in which 
he (Kader Mia) and I can jointly affirm our many common identities (even as 
the warring singularists howl at the gate) � 
We have to make sure, above all, that our 
mind is not halved by a horizon� ” [51]
Injustice can never be undone by returning hatred� Therefore, 
Christ’s insistence on “Love Thy Enemy �” Of  course, the opposition 
to this ethic seems to be as strong today as when Christ lived in 
Jerusalem� Societies across the world are grappling with groups and 
individuals who foster hatred between different communities � In 
that context, it is particularly inspiring to pay close attention to 
how Gandhi arrived at this conviction — because this also explains 
his confidence in the power of  overlapping spiritual traditions and 
cultures �
Christ’s Sermon on the Mount was one of  the key inspirations It used to be argued 
that it takes a leader 
of  Gandhi’s moral 
stature to deploy 
non-violence as a 
‘weapon’. But that 
has been proven 
to be untrue by 
struggles across 
the world40Civilizational Gandhi
in Gandhi’s life � He encountered the sermon directly from the Bible 
and also through Tolstoy’s book The Kingdom of  God is Within You�[xvii] 
Yes, the “Love They Enemy” approach to dealing with conflict 
seems to be much harder to work with� But it might help to recall 
that at the beginning of  the 20th century it seemed ‘impossible’ 
that colonialism could be defeated or that non-violence could be a 
political instrument powerful enough to help overthrow empires �
It used to be argued that it takes a leader of  Gandhi’s moral 
stature to deploy non-violence as a ‘weapon’� But that has been 
proven to be untrue by struggles across the world in the 20th century 
and in the opening decades of  the current century �
Similarly, shifting the focus to the core civilizational questions 
of  purpose and meaning and moral wholeness might seem difficult today � The idea that a clash of  civilizations and cultures is inevitable 
and natural is definitely in the air. But so is the awareness that to 
be locked into this assumption would be a failure of  spirit that 
diminishes human potential�
It is not enough that peace be the goal� It must also be the 
means �
[xvii] In The Kingdom of  God is Within You, Tolstoy presented Christianity not as a 
dogmatic religion or even a revealed religion, but as an ethical system grounded 
in the development of  our conscience. It confirmed Gandhi’s conviction that returning hatred for hatred, violence for violence has been tried and has failed over and over again� Christ’s exhortation to love thy enemy is thus the only remaining course of  action� Gandhi made Tolstoy’s book mandatory reading for all members of  his first ashram, the Phoenix Settlement in South Africa�41Prosperity
III. Prosperity
“I look upon an increase of the power of the State with the greatest 
fear, because although while apparently doing good by minimising 
exploitation, it does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying 
individuality, which lies at the root of all progress. We know of so 
many cases where men have adopted trusteeship, but none where the 
State has really lived for the poor.’  
– M.K. Gandhi [52]
Business plans that aim to serve the “Bottom of the Pyramid” 
are now aplenty � At a time when “inclusive markets” and 
“inclusive growth” have become well-established mantras, it seems 
almost rude to ask “inclusion into what?” But this question is vital 
and urgent �
All the ongoing well-meaning efforts to generate livelihoods 
and reduce poverty may be futile without challenging the pyramid-like structure of  the economy �
Gandhi’s civilizational vision posed precisely this challenge in 
ways that ran counter to the two competing dominant doctrines of  the 20
th century – capitalism and state-communism� Both 
these systems assume that accumulation of  assets and productive 
resources must necessarily take the form of  a pyramid – with a 
few at the top holding the bulk of  assets, a middle class, and the 
‘masses’ at the bottom with little or no surplus accumulation� 
Capitalism favours people scrambling to find their place in this pyramid; state-communism put the State at the top and aimed to serve the interests of  the middle and the bottom�
A conventional understanding of  history dictates that the 
pyramid structure of  political economy is both ‘natural’ and inevitable � Gandhi was not blind to the evidence which supported 42Civilizational Gandhi
this view � But he was far more interested in how we might organise 
the future differently – thus his passion for production by the 
masses, instead of  mass production�
This led some of  his most affectionate contemporaries to 
dismiss, or even condemn, Gandhi for propagating an idealism that teetered on the edge of  the 
impossible � That was understandable 
in the mid-20
th century, when modern 
industry and mass production were 
seen as harbingers of  universal 
plenitude – a promise that has failed a majority of  the world’s population�
But now the digital revolution 
and innovations in decentralised renewable energy, for both industrial and domestic use, have created unprecedented opportunities for altering the pyramid structure �
In this context there is merit in examining the core values and 
principles underlying Gandhi’s passion for production by the masses � Was this perhaps an operational detail in a template, or a 
vision that might be far more relevant now?
III. i The search for an ideal economic system
A search for answers to this question may require us to move away from a black and white view of Indian development � 
That tends to force us into false choices like Gandhi or Nehru, modern or traditional, state socialism or capitalism �
Instead, the economist Raj Krishna, best known for coining the 
phrase “Hindu rate of  growth,” recommended an evolutionary 
approach� With such an approach, according to Krishna, we can 
appreciate that the priorities pursued by Nehru immediately after Independence were inevitable and necessary � In later decades, 
Krishna added, there was a need to shift the focus to the goals emphasised by Gandhi� [53]The digital revolution 
and innovations in 
renewable energy have 
created unprecedented 
opportunities 
for altering the 
pyramid structure43Prosperity
Unfortunately, Gandhi’s priorities have been misrepresented as 
an obsession with simple village life and an avoidance of  machines � 
In fact, Gandhi’s wish-list is remarkably similar to what are now 
basic goals for anyone committed simultaneously to democracy, 
markets and basic human dignity �[xviii]
These are:
• An economic system that ensures that no one suffers from want 
of  food and clothing – instead of  one that structurally fosters 
disparities and then keeps a large segment of  the population 
dependent on government doles �
• A healthy economic system would thus be one in which every working-age person is able to engage in sufficiently productive 
work�
• This is possible only if  the means of  production, for at least the elementary necessities of  life, are within the vicinity and freely 
available – instead of  being controlled by a few private entities 
or handed out by the State �
• Monopolies must not be formed either within a country or 
internationally � [54]
Firstly, production by the masses was not a mantra for Gandhi� 
He was quite happy to let all of  India’s wants and needs be produced 
by a small number of  people, if  the rest of  the population was not 
rendered idle and unemployed� Gandhi’s vision included electricity, 
[xviii] Gandhi wrote: “According to me the economic constitution of  India and for 
that matter that of  the world, should be such that no one under it should suffer 
from want of  food and clothing � In other words everybody should be able to get 
sufficient work to enable him to make the two ends meet. And this ideal can be universally realized only if  the means of  production of  the elementary necessaries of  life remain in the control of  the masses � These should be freely available to all 
as God’s air and water are or ought to be; they should not be made a vehicle of  traffic for the exploitation of  others. Their monopolization by any country, nation or group of  persons would be unjust � The neglect of  this simple principle is the 
cause of  the destitution that we witness today not only in this unhappy land but in other parts of  the world too �” [55]44Civilizational Gandhi
ship-building, iron works, machine-making and the like existing 
side by side with village handicrafts � This required a fundamental 
shift in the nature of  political economy � “Hitherto industrialization 
has been so planned as to destroy the village and the village crafts,” 
Gandhi said� “In the state of  the future, it will subserve the villagers 
and their crafts �” [56]
The spinning of  khadi and other constructive activities were 
designed to tap the instinct for self-help – to counteract a heavy dependence on a welfare State � Gandhi’s basic premise was that 
the key initiatives must come from within society, not from the government � He did not deny the 
important role for the government in 
some areas, most notably agriculture � 
But he was deeply suspicious 
of  programmes that relied on 
government aid without building up 
internal strength� So Gandhi resisted 
any solution that made people 
depend more on the government, while not placing the real power of  initiative and creativity in the hands 
of  the people � [57]
In this context, the contemporary excitement about “social 
enterprise” needs to be examined more closely � At present, a lot 
of  work in this sector is focused on making life at the bottom 
of  the pyramid more liveable � Given the magnitude of  poverty 
and indignity, any expansion of  livelihood opportunities is a noble objective – as a short-term goal�
But social enterprises can alter the future only if  they foster 
dispersed industrialisation through forms of  ownership that promote surplus accumulation at what is now the ‘bottom’� Unless 
they challenge the very structure of  the pyramid, social enterprises 
will remain a palliative, not become a cure �
Secondly, knowledge and skills have to be anchored in civil Social enterprises  
can alter the future 
only if  they foster  
dispersed 
industrialisation 
through forms of  
ownership that

accumulation at what

society rather than being dominated by organised science – which 
is inevitably driven by either the market or the State, and their 
combinations �
Gandhi’s ashrams  were a veritable laboratory for what he himself  
referred to as “scientific and prayerful experiments.” The khadi 
movement was designed to involve a large number and wide range 
of  people in research, and it also trained and oriented them for that task� Many of  the inventors and innovators who engaged 
with Gandhi in improving charkhas  were 
themselves spinners of  yarn�
“By emphasising that all science could be 
had from one’s immediate neighbourhood, 
Gandhi denies science the status of  an 
esoteric quest to be followed by a few,” writes Shambu Prasad of  Xavier’s Institute 
of  Management, Bhubaneswar:
“The unique concept of  ‘science for 
sacrifice’ was Gandhi’s and the khadi 
movement’s original contribution to science 
in civil society � …The focus of  science 
policy in India has been emphasizing 
physical resources � In contrast, in Gandhi’s methods lack of  
resources could not be an excuse for not practicing science � He was 
clear that physical resources could only stand on the stronger, moral fundamental base of  the scientists and he therefore wanted from 
them sacrifice and dedication first. This principle was highlighted 
in the khadi movement’s attempt to continue the tradition of  prayog after Gandhi as well� ” [58]
Unfortunately, these crucial details have been obscured by the 
popular narrative about the freedom struggle – which is largely preoccupied with Gandhi at the picket-lines � Khadi, as a textile 
and its institutions, is seen only as an inefficient, semi-charitable activity to aid the hapless Indian artisan. It is true that the scientific 
experimentation and zeal for innovation which imbued the original ‘By emphasising 
that all science 
could be had 
from one’s 
immediate 
neighbourhood, 
Gandhi denies 
science the status 
of  an esoteric 
quest to be 
followed by a few’46Civilizational Gandhi
practice of  khadi is long gone from the formal government-run 
khadi institutions � But the commitment to honouring the innovative 
capacities of  not just traditional crafts persons, but also other people, is now informing the work of  both individual innovators 
and activist networks �
[xix]
Thirdly, both cooperation and private capital must be respected� 
This requires an ethical basis for economic theory as well as actions 
in the marketplace � Without private capital there would be no 
progress, Gandhi said, but it is equally important that “business men will have to give fair wages to their employees, make arrangements 
for old-age pension, sickness allowance, proper housing, and so 
on�” [60]
This was not just an appeal to business people to be more socially 
responsible � It was a philosophical framework which challenged 
how classical economics had divorced morality from business and 
relegated issues of  justice and equity to be solved by politicians and 
social workers � Gandhi wrote in 1937:
“True economics never militates against the highest ethical 
standard, just as all true ethics to be worth its name must at the same time be also good economics � An economics that…enables 
the strong to amass wealth at the expense of  the weak, is a false and dismal science � It spells death� True economics, on the other 
hand, stands for social justice, it promotes the good of  all equally, including the weakest, and is indispensable for decent life �” [61]
Gandhi’s asceticism in later life tends to obscure the fact that 
he often reminded people that he is a “vanika putra,” the son of  a baniya (merchant)� Clearly, Gandhi understood the importance of  
[xix] To mark the centenary of  Hind Swaraj, a group of  Indian academicians and 
activists collectively drafted a document titled ‘Knowledge Swaraj: An Indian 
Manifesto on Science and Technology’,  which essentially explores what self-rule in 
science and technology would mean today � According to the introduction to this 
document: “This Indian Manifesto on Science and Technology argues for Indian self-rule of  its science and technology, for a knowledge democracy that draws its agenda for research and technology on the richness of  Indian culture and the needs of  the Indian people �” [59]47Prosperity
the merchant, trader and entrepreneur in a sustainable and creative 
society � He concurred with the view of  conventional economics that 
everybody does not have the capability to create wealth� Whereas capitalism turns this capacity into a justification for limitless reward 
to the entrepreneur, Gandhi saw this talent as the basis for greater 
responsibility � For Gandhi, Trusteeship was the only way for wealth 
to be held and used�
To be trustees, merchants and producers of  goods must have 
the freedom to acquire and dispose private property � The key 
element of  Trusteeship is not giving away what you accumulate, but rather the fairness of  means used to create that wealth� 
As Sudarshan Iyengar, a Gandhian scholar and Vice Chancellor 
of  Gujarat Vidyapeeth, points out: “Business was not to be driven primarily by greed, and excess of  it was simply unacceptable � While 
Gandhi was clear that the state had either no business or very little 
business in conducting the economic affairs of  the society, he was 
also very clear that the wealth creator would adhere to norms � In 
his entire discourse on sustainable society, the fairness of  means is 
extremely important �” [62]
Today there is an emerging consensus about this on most global 
public platforms � The United Nations’ Millennium Development 
Goals (MDG) have given institutional form to the view that something urgently needs to be done to ensure that everyone, 
has at least the basics – roti, kapda, makan, swasthya, shiksha (food, 
clothing, shelter, health-care and education) � All 193 member 
countries of  the United Nations have committed themselves to the MDG which have, among other aims, set targets for eradicating extreme poverty and ensuring universal primary education as well 
as healthcare � Most of  those targets will remain distant if  India 
does not achieve the basics for its people �
So where do we go from here? Some answers can emerge from 
examining how Gandhi’s critique of  modern political economy 
is now informing both dissent and work on alternatives � Let us 
explore the prospects for Sarvodaya and Trusteeship �48Civilizational Gandhi
III. ii Sarvodaya: Welfare of all
On a bright and chilly morning in December 2010, hundreds 
of farmers from different parts of India gathered at the place 
where Gandhi’s mortal remains were cremated on the banks of the Yamuna river in Delhi � They came to renew a pledge to make 
Sarvodaya a living reality for all Indians�
That solemn gathering at Raj Ghat marked the culmination of  
the Kisan Swaraj Yatra, which had begun three months earlier at Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad� Traversing 20 states of  India, this march resulted in the formation of  an informal network of  400 activist groups who now call themselves ASHA – hope (Alliance 
for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) � Their slogan is equally 
evocative – “Food, Farmers, Freedom� ” [63]
The alliance’s basic demand is that resources like seeds, land and 
water, which are crucial to the livelihoods of  people, must not be 
controlled or dominated either by the State or by a few powerful private entities � This resistance is in no small measure a response 
to the fact that a staggering number of  Indian farmers have been killing themselves due to economic distress � According to the 
National Crime Bureau 2,70,940 farmers have committed suicide 
since 1995� [64]
This agrarian distress is a consequence of  complex overlapping 
factors – including failures of  public policy and the market 
mechanism� Governments, both at the centre and in the states, 
have enormous power to decide which types of  agricultural 
technology and inputs will receive subsidies and credit support from nationalised banks � This power, which was meant to protect 
farmers, now often serves the interests of  agro-industry �
In addition, corruption is rampant in the acquisition of  
agricultural lands for either private industry or development projects � 
In many cases, forcible acquisitions have been passionately resisted 
by protest movements, including the anti-big dam struggles on the 
banks of  the Narmada river in western India, and the opposition to 49Prosperity
the Tata’s proposed factory for Nano cars in Singur in West Bengal�
Movements like Kisan Swaraj and ASHA are neither against 
industrialisation, nor do they oppose profits and rewards for 
innovators and entrepreneurs � What they militate against are 
command and control business models which are undemocratic 
and anti-market � The vast concentrations of  power in these models 
undermine the freedom for fair exchange – which is the essence of  
a healthy market culture �
ASHA has adopted a four-pillared ‘Kisan Swaraj Neeti’ and 
wants the central and state governments to do the same � The four 
pillars are income security for farmers; ecological sustainability of  agriculture; 
people’s control over agricultural 
resources like land, water and seed; and access to safe, healthy and sufficient 
food for all� [65]
There can be no dispute about that last 
demand – everyone must have sufficient 
food� It is the question of  ‘how’ that puts networks like ASHA at odds with 
agro-industry – in opposition to the 
technology it promotes and its business 
models, whether private or state-owned�
Chemical intensive industrial 
agriculture, which gave large yields in 
the short and medium term, has caused large-scale degradation of  soils across 
the world� In 2008, the International 
Assessment of  Agricultural Science and 
Technology for Development (IAASTD), a multi-stakeholder exercise sponsored by the United Nations, pronounced a grim prognosis � [66]
The prevailing forms of  industrial agriculture, controlled by a 
few large companies and governments, cannot deliver food security � Chemical intensive 
industrial 
agriculture, which 
gave large yields 
in the short and 
medium term, has 
caused large-scale

“If  we persist with business as usual, the world’s people will not be 
fed adequately over the next 50 years � Business as usual will result 
in further degradation of  the environment and further widening of  the gap between those who have and those who don’t,” Robert 
Watson, the Director of  IAASTD, said�
[xx] [67]
The quest for Sarvodaya is undermined not just by certain 
forms of  industrial agriculture but also by command and control 
business models � For instance, farmers in many parts of  the world 
are being monitored by the “gene police” of  large corporations, in order to enforce patents that prevent farmers from saving seeds 
and re-planting them� Some varieties of  industrial seeds are now 
deliberately designed for one-season planting, making the farmer perpetually dependent on the manufacturer �
Networks like Kisan Swaraj find common ground with 
Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in the U �S� and other 
parts of  the world� The term ‘CSA’ is used to describe a wide variety of  business models through which consumers form links 
with local farmers – sometimes by paying in advance for produce � 
Growers and consumers share both the risks and benefits of  food 
production – which is often organic and includes varieties of  fruits 
and vegetables that cannot be found in the mass production supply 
chains of  supermarkets �
These initiatives have become stronger with support from the 
international peasant movement known as La Via Campesina 
(LVC), which was founded in 1993 by farmers from four continents � 
LVC includes 150 organisations in 70 countries from Africa, Asia, 
Europe and the Americas – who together claim to represent 
approximately 200 million farmers � This network, with a secretariat 
[xx] Professor Robert Watson also said, “We are putting food that appears cheap 
on our tables but it is food that is not always healthy and that costs us dearly in 
terms of  water, soil and the biological diversity on which all our futures depend� At present more than 850 million people in the world are hungry or malnourished and 4 million more will join the ranks annually � The reason is not a lack of  agricultural 
production, but rather a lack of  access and delivery to the poor, as well as the effects of  trade distortions such as subsidies and tariffs �” [68]51Prosperity
in Jakarta, is committed to defending “small-scale sustainable 
agriculture as a way to promote social justice and dignity � It strongly 
opposes corporate driven agriculture and transnational companies that are destroying people and nature �”
[xxi] [69]
Underlying all such campaigns is a rather basic and dark question: 
can civilization survive if  food and its related technologies are completely subordinated to the profit motive and subsumed in a model of  commerce that leads to vast concentration of  power?
The global commercial seed market is now estimated to be 
more than $27,400 million annually � Ten companies own 73% of  
this market’s share, with just three companies controlling more than 53%� Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company and fourth 
largest pesticide company, now controls more than one-quarter 
of  the global commercial seed market � In India, Monsanto and its 
subsidiaries command approximately 45% of  the seed market �
Networks like ASHA and CSA also challenge intellectual 
property rights (IPRs), which put still more power at the top of  
the pyramid� IPR regimes of  the last two decades have reversed 
the core principle of  granting such rights – to reward inventors for putting knowledge in the public domain� Instead, IPRs are now 
being used to lock away formulas and exert ever greater control 
over the products created with that knowledge �
But it is vital to note that campaigns that focus on “food, 
farmers, freedom” are not merely an opposition to agro-industry’s command and control business models � Fundamentally they are 
driven by the quest for a society worth living in – one based on Sarvodaya, even if  many people in these movements do not use 
this term�
Michael Pollan, an American activist and noted scholar on 
the political economy of  food, has emphasised that the food 
[xxi] La Via Campesina describes itself  as “an autonomous, pluralist and multicultural 
movement, independent from any political, economic or other type of  affiliation.” 
The Indian Coordination Committee of  Farmers’ Movements (ICCFM) is the Indian counterpart of  LVC, and is an active member of  the ASHA alliance � [70]52Civilizational Gandhi
movements are essentially about community, identity, pleasure, 
and, “carving out a new social and economic space removed from 
the influence of  big corporations on the one side and government 
on the other �” Pollan goes on to make a deeper observation:
“���The modern marketplace would have us decide what to buy 
strictly on the basis of  price and self-interest; the food movement implicitly proposes that we enlarge our understanding of  both those terms, suggesting that not just ‘good value’ but ethical and political values should inform our buying decisions, and that we’ll 
get more satisfaction from our eating when they do �” [71]
Another dimension of  this striving is evident in people’s 
struggles to challenge the dominant paradigm of  knowledge and claim space for knowledge systems that have been ignored or 
devalued� Anil Gupta of  the Indian Institute of  Management, Ahmedabad, is well-known for his seminal work in identifying and 
honouring grassroots knowledge and innovation� Gupta’s ‘Shodh 
Yatras’ have become a legend� These are group tours in different parts of  rural India, to identify local knowledge about eco-systems 
and also to locate innovators creating a wide variety of  gadgets 
and devices that enhance livelihoods – and usually also reduce drudgery � [72]
At the more radical and ideological end of  the spectrum, the 
Lok Vidya Jan Andolan brings together activists, farmers and artisans seeking to honour those who are usually derided as the “ignorant masses �” The Andolan is anchored at the Vidya Ashram 
in Sarnath near Varanasi� This network emerged from a series of  conferences on traditional Indian sciences and technologies, held in the 1990s � Lok Vidya, literally “people’s knowledge,” refers to 
the knowledge that people have acquired from elders, from peers, in the community, at the site of  work, through experiments over generations and by their own genius – but which is granted no 
status by the modern science establishment, universities and the 
State� [73]
Similarly, the Adivasi Academy in Tejgadh, Gujarat, is an 53Prosperity
unusual centre of  learning, which aims to build “a new outlook 
to development by underlining tribal values of  self-reliance, self-
confidence, hard work and building capabilities to survive against all 
odds by rescuing their dignity and respecting their cultural heritage 
through festivals, organizing cultural performances, theatre, songs, 
dances, rituals, documenting folklore and promoting modernizing tools in their languages �” [74]
In Udaipur, a non-governmental organisation called Shikshantar 
is engaged in being a ‘People’s Institute for Rethinking Education and 
Development’� Its aim is to bring about a “systematic transformation 
of  education in order to facilitate Swaraj-development throughout India� ” Shikshantar works on the premise that education systems 
across the world serve to stratify society, glorify militarism, devalue local knowledge systems and languages, manufacture unsustainable wants, breed discontent and frustration, stifle creativity, motivation 
and expression, and dehumanize communities � In response to this 
Shikshantar offers an alternative to the “factory-schooling” which stands in the way of  building organic learning societies for the 21
st 
century �[xxii] [75]
There are numerous such initiatives in India, and they are in 
solidarity with a wide range of  alternative networks across the 
world� For example, Schumacher College, is a centre for scholars 
[xxii] Shikshantar’s Mission Statement says: “After fifty years of  so-called 
development efforts, and despite great scientific advancements, India (and the rest 
of  the world) finds itself  mired in a paralyzing socio-cultural, environmental and spiritual crisis – overwhelming in its scale, intensity and rate of  growth� While education has been framed as the cure to this crisis, in reality, the factory model of  schooling is part of  the problem� ���� The 19th-century model of  factory-schooling today stands in the way of  building organic learning societies for the 21st century. [Empahsis 
in original]����Rather, communities must engage in new modes of  lifelong societal learning which grow from a larger understanding of  and respect for human potential and human dignity, dynamic learning processes and relationships, pluralistic identities and cultural contexts, the human spirit and its connection to the web of  life � The challenge before us then is to engage in processes of  
transdisciplinary reflection, dialogue, vision-building and experimentation in order to: provoke, challenge and dismantle factory-schooling and construct and connect new open learning communities �” [76]54Civilizational Gandhi
and activists who are engaged in forging mechanisms that would 
make Sarvodaya possible � A London-based think-tank called the 
New Economics Foundation (NEF) is engaged in action-based research which offers ways to alter the pyramid structure of  the 
economy � [77, 78]�
When the NEF was founded in 1986 it was quite radical 
to challenge the stranglehold of  
conventional economic thinking � But 
over the last 20 years the space for such 
challenges has grown� In the year 2000, 
economics students at the Sorbonne in Paris launched a movement called Post-
Autistic Economics, which rejected much 
of  what they were being taught for being out of  sync with reality � This led to a 
web-based platform called Real-World Economics which now has thousands of  members � [79]
More recently, in response to the financial crisis of  2008, the 
Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) was founded in New York – with philanthropic support from the legendary hedge fund manager George Soros � INET is dedicated to funding a 
fundamental shift in economic thinking because, says its website, “the havoc wrought by our recent global financial crisis has vividly demonstrated the deficiencies in our outdated current economic 
theories, and shown the need for new economic thinking – right 
now�” [80]
New political imaginations are also emerging in Latin America� 
When Ecuador rewrote its Constitution in 2007, it recognised the 
Rights of  Nature. These changes to the Constitution were ratified 
by a referendum in 2008� In Bolivia, a sustained movement by the indigenous people led to a similar law granting nature equal rights 
with humans �
These changes are not only aimed at restoring the environment, 
they are also a powerful reaffirmation of  indigenous people’s lok These changes are 
a reaffirmation of  
people’s  
‘lok vidya’, 
which has never 
regarded nature 
as a commodity55Prosperity
vidya, which has never regarded nature as a commodity � These 
changes are a validation of  indigenous knowledge systems that are 
more synchronised with nature than with modern systems � The 
developments in Bolivia and Ecuador have been widely welcomed as indicators that humanity can shift to a new paradigm�
[xxiii]
The sharper edge of  this restlessness is still restricted to radical 
activist formations, but this does not mean that dissent is limited 
to the margins of  global society � Some of  the most profound 
but subtle challenges have become manifest at the core of  the mainstream – in the world of  finance, in the realm of  software and 
within the discipline of  economics �
In this context, what are the prospects for Trusteeship?
III. iii Trusteeship: Oceanic circles of co-ownership
In August 2006, the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible 
Investing (UNPRI) were launched with fanfare at the New 
York Stock Exchange � The immediate driver of UNPRI was the 
work of the UN’s Global Compact initiative, through which major corporations have attempted to align their quest for profits with a 
framework of greater social and environmental responsibility �
The deeper origins of  this historic development lie in the 
emergence of  Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) as a parallel 
track in the mainstream of  international finance. By the time the 
UNPRI were launched, it was estimated that $3 trillion of  global 
investments are based on SRI criteria� The net worth of  companies who are signatories to the UNPRI is estimated to be $30 trillion�
SRI has no direct link with Gandhian thinking � However, many 
of  its original promoters were driven by an outrage about the 
[xxiii] The Indigenous Knowledge and Peoples Network (IKAP), based in Chiang Mai, 
Thailand, is also working to ensure that tribal communities are able to participate fully 
in their country’s development by utilising indigenous knowledge and perspectives �  
IKAP also fosters mutual support and cross-border relationships between indigenous and tribal peoples and communities throughout the region� [81]56Civilizational Gandhi
disconnection between business and a social responsibility that is 
based on a moral framework� They have crafted elaborate social 
and environmental metrics which enable businesses to measure the 
value they generate on a “Triple Bottom Line” – people, planet, 
profit.
Many SRI investors may still see themselves as ‘owners’ and 
not custodians or trustees of  the assets in their portfolio � Within 
India too, Gandhi’s vision of  Trusteeship is still widely regarded as 
too idealistic – a utopian concept that could threaten our material 
ambitions � This view persists despite the fact that the bulk of  shares 
in Tata Sons, one of  India’s largest and most respected industrial 
houses, is owned by charitable trusts set up by the Tata family in 
earlier generations. Sixty-six percent of  the profits of  Tata Sons 
flow into the philanthropic endeavours of  the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Sir Ratan Tata Trust and other trusts � [82]
In essence though, Trusteeship is not only an act of  giving away 
accumulated wealth� It encompasses the wider values which imbue the creation of  the wealth� At a dialogue on Trusteeship in 2010, 
this view was richly manifest � The event, hosted by the Udaipur-
based NGO Seva Mandir, brought together some of  India’s 
leading development workers, academics and one representative 
of  the corporate sector, from the ICICI Foundation� The dialogue 
unfurled some hopeful possibilities �
Almost all the 55 participants agreed that Trusteeship is not 
a burden or moral obligation that has to be fulfilled by denying 
yourself � Instead, Trusteeship is meaningful only if  it is experienced 
as a form of  freedom, an act of  self-expression and self-fulfilment.
Ideally, the term Trusteeship is closely identified with the 
values of  cooperation, compassion, co-ownership, transparency, equity – values which balance individual interest with the larger 
common good� In this sense, Trusteeship is a concept that applies to everyone – not just those who wield large surpluses of  capital and other assets �
The dominant opinion of  course still maintains that human 57Prosperity
nature is essentially combative and Trusteeship is for dreamers � But 
as a participant said at the dialogue in Udaipur, “The notion that 
pragmatic people don’t look at utopian values, is false � Everyone is 
searching � The question is — where do we go from here?”
We could begin by reaffirming Gandhi’s insistence on seeing 
business-industry as an integral part of  the ethical revitalisation 
of  society, of  samaj – a veteran social activist, Kishore Saint, said 
at the Udaipur conference � This may require some degree of  
faith in the possibility of  hridaya-parivartan (change of  heart) and 
consciousness, Saint said, “from unfettered self-interest to need-based common good� ”
Ironically, most people are unaware that the world-wide web is a 
consequence of  an approximation of  this approach� It is a triumph of  the Free Software and Open Source movement which emerged in the mid-1980s � Tim Berners-Lee, who designed the concept of  
the web and the protocols that make it possible, chose not to patent his designs � This was the only way that the web could be developed 
as a free and open space to serve the common good�
Richard Stallman, a software programmer who founded the 
Boston-based Free Software Foundation (FSF), has famously said 
that his mission is the “freedom to cooperate �” Sharing is essential 
to society, Stallman says � For over a quarter century, the votaries 
of  the Open Source movement have shown that they are not anti-
commerce � They simply don’t derive satisfaction by controlling 
large concentrations of  money or resources � The overwhelming 
majority of  servers worldwide now run on open source software �
So what? the sceptic might argue, the software giants of  the 
global market work to maximise monetary profits and selectively use open source technology while negating its values � Does that 
not reinforce the impossibility of  Trusteeship? In the short to medium term that might be true � But the development of  the world 
wide web and the Open Source ethos are epoch-shaping events of  incalculable significance. They breathe life into core civilizational 
values – cooperation, co-ownership, transparency, equity – in ways 58Civilizational Gandhi
that Gandhi may not have imagined�
So how do we journey across the short and medium term when 
the will to power, the grab-and-rule ethos, is in a pitched battle with 
the potential for Sarvodaya and Trusteeship?
As a first step, we could acknowledge that the cultural and 
political actions of  the last two centuries have given rise to the present dominant mindset � It follows then that counter actions in 
the present can create and nurture a different construct for the future � During the past two centuries only persistent effort has 
made such shifts possible – for example, the abolition of  slavery, the revolt against colonialism, the adoption of  adult franchise, and 
the rejection of  racism�
Secondly, parallel to the 
excitement about innovation 
in technology and business 
models, we can celebrate and 
reward innovation that gives a moral anchor to our actions in the marketplace � We could begin 
by highlighting the experience of  those who have already done this – however mixed their 
successes. This affirmation could extend from the older Tata Sons 
to the newer, smaller and radical work of  Fabindia, which works with craftspeople and other producer-owned companies to market 
their products through a single nationwide brand� [83]
Thirdly, and most importantly, we need a combination of  
restlessness and patience � Restlessness will drive the efforts to 
anchor our actions in a moral framework, patience will imbue us with staying power and the requisite persistence �
In 1947, Gandhi expressed the hope that in 50 years there may be 
enough innovation to create employment for everyone on the basis 
of  modern technology � [84] Theoretically, that is now possible � It is 
widely recognised that we now live in a time when technology has We need a combination 
of  restlessness and 
patience. Restlessness 
will drive the efforts 
to anchor our actions 
in a moral framework, 
patience will imbue us 
with staying power and 
the requisite persistence59Prosperity
the potential to bolster unprecedented democratisation� The world 
wide web, cell phones, and decentralised renewable energy are just 
a few examples of  this potential�
Today, more than ever before, 
we have the means for dispersed production, for production and 
services by ordinary people that are state-of-the-art and not merely remnants of  old crafts and skills � 
The prospects for large-scale change may not look good right now because ‘growth’ is measured 
in aggregate terms, and efforts 
are focused on growing various industries in absolute numbers and 
only then worrying about ‘inclusion’�
So the challenge lies in working out how both technology and 
business models can be positioned to alter the structure of  the 
economy – transform it from a pyramid to what Gandhi visualised 
as “oceanic circles” – a dynamic of  interdependence based on cooperation and creative competition�
Here is an illustration of  this dream: In the old paradigm of  
industrialisation, the cotton crop is sold by farmers to merchants who pack it into bales for transportation to large-scale processing factories and yarn-spinning mills elsewhere � In the new paradigm, a 
collaboration between the Hyderabad-based Decentralised Cotton Yarn Trust (DCYT) and Vortex Engineering, a private company based in Chennai, has led to the development of  a “micro-spinning” 
machine to process raw cotton and spin yarn, locally � 
[xxiv]
[xxiv] The DCYT crossed the pilot stage two years ago � In June 2012 it had four 
functional units running � Three more units are expected to come up by 2014� At 
present, the DCYT units produce 36,000 metres annually � The yarn is sold by the 
Malkha Marketing Trust � Sales increased from Rs � 36 lakhs in 2010-11 to Rs � 62 
lakhs in 2011-12� [85]The challenge lies 
in working out how 
both technology and 
business models can 
be positioned to alter 
the structure of  the 
economy – transform 
it from a pyramid to 
what Gandhi visualised 
as ‘oceanic circles’60Civilizational Gandhi
Cotton farmers as well as handloom weavers, who suffer due 
to a lack of  affordable and reliable supply of  cotton yarn, benefit 
directly � This innovation is much more than the on-site value-
addition enabled by hundreds of  social enterprises � It is a potential 
structural shift that, if  scaled up, could alter the pyramid itself  – to 
a form or shape which is as yet unknown�
“Life will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom, 
but it will be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual 
always ready to perish for the village, the latter ready to perish for 
the circle of  villages, till at last the whole becomes one life composed 
of  individuals…the outermost circumference will not wield power to 
crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its 
strength from it.”  
– M.K.Gandhi [86]61Environment
IV. Environment
Gandhi’s observation that there is enough for everyone’s needs, 
but not for everyone’s greed, is perhaps his most-cited quote � 
What if the challenge of environmental sustainability is not just a matter of containing greed and curtailing consumption?
At the core of  Gandhi’s civlizational concepts is a critique 
of  how we define value. As long as ‘value’ is measured entirely 
in material and monetary terms, in terms of  price equals value, it 
may not be possible to align nature’s eco-systems and the human economy �
IV. i Moving from profits to the priceless
In 2007, shortly after he was appointed to the I � G� Patel Chair at 
the London School of Economics, Nicholas Stern visited India 
to promote the idea of low-carbon growth � This was a logical 
follow-up to Stern’s well-known report for the British Treasury, which concluded that climate change represents the greatest and 
most wide-ranging market failure in history �
At a panel discussion in Mumbai, Stern spoke passionately about 
how imperative it was for Indian businesses and the government 
to adopt low-carbon technologies � Anand Mahindra, chairman 
and managing director of  Mahindra Group, who was also on that panel, reminded the people who had gathered there why Mahatma Gandhi had been against India adopting the western model of  
modern development � Long before the term eco-footprint became 
current, Mahindra said, Gandhi knew, even in the 1940s, that it 
would take several earths for everyone to live as a few western 
nations were living �
Then Mahindra narrated a story which captures the essence 
of  the contemporary challenge � A village in Goa grew exquisite 
watermelons � For a long time, the fruit-growers followed a tradition� 62Civilizational Gandhi
The best-looking melons were not sent to the market � They were 
given free to the children of  the village � In return, the children only 
had to save the seeds of  the very best melons from this already 
select lot � The farmers then planted those best of  best seeds – 
thereby ensuring future multiplication of  the tastiest melons �
After some time, some farmers decided to maximise their cash 
profits and started selling the most perfect melons – which fetched a much higher price � The tradition soon fell apart � Gradually, the 
quality of  melons declined – to the point where the village no 
longer had melons worthy of  selling �
Neither the story, nor its message, is new � Mindless and short-
term maximisation of  profit is a dead-end street. Everyone agrees on that in principle � The conventional wisdom of  our times dictates 
that individuals, communities, companies and countries should be 
able to detect the threshold of  self-destruction in time �
As a development economist it is Stern’s job to demonstrate how 
livelihoods can be increased while reducing ecological footprints � 
But can this be done only by shifting to low-carbon growth? After all, excess carbon is one part of  a much wider process of  ecological decline � Stern called climate change the greatest market failure in 
history because the pursuit of  need and greed has not optimised outcomes but rapidly and increasingly deteriorated the natural base, 
without which the human economy cannot survive, let alone thrive � 
But awareness of  the ecological crisis has only slightly dented the 
fundamental assumption of  market-driven globalisation – namely, 
that with an appropriate regulatory framework the price mechanism 
and the profit motive ensure efficiency and growth indefinitely.
Deeper enquiry and introspection are still limited to a few 
sections of  academia and civil society organisations � For instance, 
the American economist Duncan Foley has identified what ails our age� He calls it “Adam’s Fallacy” – the idea at the heart of  the 
‘modern’ era, which has ruled the West since the 18th century � This 
refers to the belief, common since Adam Smith, that the economic 
sphere of  life can and should be separated from the rest of  social 63Environment
life� And that in the economic sphere the pursuit of  self-interest will 
be guided by objective ‘laws’ to create socially-beneficial outcomes. 
[87]
That tale about watermelons told by Mahindra did more than 
illustrate the dangers of  this fallacy � It brought to the table the mere 
hint of  a radical idea – that in its pre profit-maximisation stage that 
community in Goa was perhaps organised around intrinsic values – such as enriching children’s lives and at the same time growing the tastiest melons � The joy of  those best melons was ‘priceless’— that 
is, deliberately placed outside the price mechanism�
The difficult question to be asked then is this: is responding 
to climate change a managerial and technological task, or is it a 
civilizational challenge? If  it is a comprehensive challenge, can it 
be addressed without restoring the importance of  intrinsic value and, even in the material realm, not limiting the definition of  value 
to price?
IV. ii What is the purpose?
Gandhi’s civilizational lens encourages us to look for ways to 
assert the primacy of values, for an ethical framework which 
gives purpose to life � As an illustration, let us consider some aspects 
of the famous Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) or Save Narmada Movement, which got little attention in the mainstream � 
[xxv]
The NBA came to life around the slogan: “We want development 
not destruction� ” During 10 years of  intensive struggle, which was 
[xxv] In the 1970s an elaborate plan was drawn to build a series of  dams on the 
Narmada river, which flows east to west across central India. At that time, it was 
the last major river in India still in free flow, dams had been built on most other big rivers. In the mid-1980s work on the first mega dam over the Narmada, the Sardar Sarovar Project, went into full swing � Soon the approximately 250,000 people 
affected by the construction of  the dam, protested� Some refused to be displaced from their traditional ways of  life, based on river-fed agriculture � Others objected 
to the inadequate, in many cases non-existent, resettlement and compensation package �64Civilizational Gandhi
extensively covered by the mass media, the NBA succeeded in 
bringing the issue of  displacement to public attention in India and 
making it a human rights issue �
Technologists and social scientists also gave vital inputs to the 
debate about big versus small dams � Some of  this work also posed 
a fundamental critique of  the technological paradigm of  damming 
the river � However, the Narmada projects were pushed through 
even when evidence was growing in other countries about the poor cost-benefit ratio of  mega dams and the enormous damage they 
cause to human settlements and the environment � At about the 
same time the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze river 
in China was similarly pushed through despite intensive local and 
international opposition�
The dams on the Narmada, many of  them now completed and 
operational, remain a powerful symbol of  modernity, progress and development � The critique of  a paradigm of  technology which 
cannot harness the benefits of  water without destroying the river, 
has found no space in public discourse in India�
The deeper questions generated by the Narmada movement 
failed to resonate in the public mind for two reasons � Firstly, 
knowledge about the dynamics of  watersheds and related eco-systems is still not given enough importance � As long as the river 
can be harnessed to provide water and electricity to urban centres, environmental damage is deemed to be a price worth paying �
Secondly, dams do not last for ever – siltation and structural 
decay limit their life � Proponents of  the dam do not seem to care 
that they are creating a benefit for just three or four generations, 
but in the process perhaps irretrievably destroying the river as a 
perennial resource �
Once purpose has been reduced to economic growth, as defined 
by cusecs of  water and megawatts of  electricity, there is no space for re-examining that fundamental question: what is the good that we actually seek? Is it just water and electricity now or sustained and 
widespread benefit for all time to come?65Environment
On the fields and uncultivated lands on the banks of  the 
Narmada, amid the natural foliage, you might see three trees in 
different stages of  carefully-nurtured growth� Bamboo shavings 
form a protective guard around a fragile peepal; a few feet away, a 
similar makeshift fence protects a neem plant; and a little further 
away there is a fledgling banyan� None of  these trees bears a saleable 
fruit, but each of  them has properties which enrich the eco-system 
and have multiple benefits in medicine, agriculture and livestock-
rearing �
Planting this trio of  trees and bringing them to maturity is an 
ancient custom, a code for success, an act that gives a sense of  
purpose � If  you ask the villagers of  this fertile agrarian belt to 
explain, you might get a range of  answers �
Some might cryptically say that completing this tree task is a way 
of  justifying one’s existence – a payback to the bounty of  nature � 
Others might poetically explain that the planting is a way of  being anchored in what really matters; and that all other success – in making money, raising a family, pleasure seeking – rotates on this 
fulcrum�
Contrast this with the assertion that the factors fuelling climate 
change can only be altered to the extent allowed by market forces � 
In this oddly inverted argument, “the market” is an intransigent, unconquerable force of  nature – and the human capacity to create 
and live by ethical and spiritual norms is regarded as relatively unreliable �
IV. iii An economy of permanence
It was this displacement of a moral and spiritual anchor that led Gandhi to conclude that the modern is not a civilization at all � 
Across the world now there are struggles to reclaim the socially-embedded bazaar  from the socially-disconnected ‘market’— an 
amoral entity outside and above ‘society’ � Essentially, these are 
efforts to recover what the philosopher and economic historian Karl Polanyi referred to as the “organic society” and the “moral 66Civilizational Gandhi
economy” – which was superceded by the rise of the modern 
market in the 18th and 19th centuries � [88]
Gandhi’s disciple, J �C� Kumarappa, studied the possibilities 
of  a holistic connection between nature, society and the political 
economy � A graduate of  Columbia University who was once an 
accountant, Kumarappa augmented Gandhi’s vision by drawing 
economic principles from nature half  a century before the term 
“bio-mimicry” was coined�
Human systems, Kumarappa observed, need to learn from 
nature, where every being fulfils its necessary role in the cycle of  
life by performing its own primary function� Nature, Kumarappa 
observed, “… enlists and ensures the co-operation of  all its units, 
each working for itself  and in the process helping other units to get along their own too – the mobile helping the immobile, and 
the sentient the insentient � Thus all nature is dovetailed together 
in a common cause � Nothing exists for itself � When this works out 
harmoniously and violence does not break the chain, we have an 
economy of  permanence �” [89]
Kumarappa was confident that the arrangements of  daily life 
could be “regulated in accordance with the dictates of  our better self�” This was not a utopian fantasy � On the contrary, Kumarappa 
argued, an economy that is based purely on monetary or material standards of  value is out of  tune with reality � His reasoning was 
more logical than moral�
If  nature’s economy and the human economy are to be 
synchronised, observed Kumarappa, the standard of  value must be based on something other than the individual doing the valuing � 
Individuals, after all, are perishable themselves � It follows that a 
valid and sustainable basis for determining value would necessarily have to be detached and independent of  personal feelings – be it generosity or greed� Value needs to be based on an objective 
understanding of  the “permanent order of  things” – the 
interdependence of  all species with the biosphere and atmosphere �
Kumarappa set the bar high, but this vision of  interdependence 67Environment
between nature’s economy and the human economy has a greater 
presence in the global discourse now than it did in Gandhi’s and 
Kumarappa’s time �
For the Rio+20 summit held in June 2012 the UN chose the 
theme of  ‘The Future We Want �’ When launching this campaign, 
the UN Secretary General said, “We need to imagine a different 
future � What would our world look like if  everyone had access 
to the food they need, to an education, and to the energy that is required to develop? What would our communities look like if  we 
created a vibrant, job-rich, green economy? This is the future we 
want�” [90]
The ‘we’ being represented here is ambiguous � Many social and 
environmental activists have condemned Rio+20 for defining a “green economy” in terms that suits existing and dominant business models � But the idea of  a “future we want” is worth rigorously 
exploring from many different perspectives �
Above all, the future may depend on addressing a fundamental 
question – how do we decide what is priceless? Gandhi’s ideal of  a civilized society offers markers which help us to process this question� This vision acknowledges that greed and the will to 
grab power are part of  the human condition� But these are not 
necessarily our most dominant traits � Human behaviour, like water, 
fills the spaces created by the rules we frame. So why not frame the rules on the basis of  a more holistic view of  the human condition�68Civilizational Gandhi
Epilogue
“The revelation of spirit in man is truly modern, I am on its side, 
for I am modern. …If you want to reject me, you are free to do so. But 
I have my right as a revolutionary to carry the flag of freedom of spirit 
into the shrine of your idols – material power and accumulation”  
– Rabindranath Tagore. [91]
Revolts of the spirit against material might are not new � Over 
2000 years ago, a group of Jain philosophers annoyed Alexander 
of Macedonia simply by ignoring him � When asked why they were 
indifferent to the great conqueror, the Jain contemplatives replied:
“King Alexander, every man can possess only so much of  the 
earth’s surface as this we are standing on� You are but human like 
the rest of  us, save that you are always busy and up to no good, 
travelling so many miles from your home, a nuisance to yourself  and to others! … You will soon be dead, and then you will own just 
as much of  the earth as will suffice to bury you.” [92]
The historical Gandhi was called a ‘Mahatma’ – a great soul – 
because he was so clearly an inheritor of  this spiritual legacy, with 
all its inherent defiance. But this became an excuse or justification 
for most of  us to convince ourselves that only saints remain fearless 
when faced with the threat of  power and they alone can resist its 
seductive lure �
But there has always been, in all times, a vast and fertile ground 
between the will to power at one extreme, and renunciation on the 
other � Gandhi’s civilizational critique helps us to creatively explore 
this rather inviting and habitable middle ground and grapple with 
the ever-lively dynamic between the will to power and the urge to 
cooperate, to nurture and share �
If  this seems to be extraordinarily difficult, that is because we 69Epilogue
live in an age which encourages us to be sceptical of  everything 
except scepticism� And particularly to doubt anything which places 
demands on our higher self, on the finer human qualities.
Can we as individuals, and in collectives, assert the power of  those 
higher faculties – in time to resolve the multiple crises we now face?  
Natural and inevitable as this question is, I am inclined to ignore it 
because futuristic speculation is a waste of  time �
It is far more energising and inspiring to focus on even the most 
slender evidence of  dharma as civic humanism, and to attend to all the many ways in which it can be expanded�
The field of  possibility is richer and more complex than can be 
conveyed here � What matters is that a wide range of  people all over 
the world are asking these fundamental questions, grappling with the complexities, and slowly but surely turning glimmers of  hope into beacons �70List of references

2.  TO  THE  CULTIVATORS  OF  KHEDA
[April  29, 1931] 2
I had written in Navajivan3  That no cultivator4  is obliged to pay
revenue by incurring debt.  I write the following further to clarify the
matter.
1.Whether the cultivator has gone on ‘Hijarat’ or not if he
has suffered substantially by reason of satyagraha movement such a
satya-grahi Cultivator is not obliged to pay revenue by incurring debt.
2.The duty of all other cultivators—those who have not taken
part in the satyagraha movement and those who have not suffered
substantially—is to pay the revenue even if it becomes necessary to
incur debt for such purpose.
3.The cultivators covered by item I should realize that in my
opinion their interest lies in keeping the Truce.  I shall make every
endeavour to get suspension of their land revenue up to next year but
if I fail the peasants will have to undergo considerable suffering and
this suggestion does not apply to those who are not prepared to
undergo such suffering.

BORSAD,
April  29, 1931
DEAR  CHARU  PROBHA,
I was delighted to have your letter.  You would certainly not
reject the company of the young men who may not hold the same
view on non-violence that you and I do but you will expect to convert
them by your affection and still more by proving the efficacy of your
own method in daily  conduct.  You will not expect me to give you
long letters.  No apology is needed for faulty English. Why should
we be ashamed of making errors in a foreign tongue?  What, however,
I would like you to do is to pick up Hindi and begin to write in Hindi.
Hindi you can learn in a very short time.

  April  29, 1931
I have had so many letters2 from you but I have seemingly  
neglected you. The fact is I have had no time.  Karachi washed me out
completely.  The fatigue has not yet left me entirely.  I am obliged to
sleep two or three times during the day so as to keep me fresh for
work that I must do.
I hope your sister is better if not completely restored.  Anyway I
am glad you are by her side.  Please give my love to her.
You have taken it for granted that I am going to London. I am
not at all sure and I am certainly not going if there , is no Hindu-
Muslim solution. There is no immediate prospect. And then the
Settlement itself runs the risk of being broken to pieces in Gujarat. Of
course I am making every endeavour to see that it is honoured by the
officials here. But it is an uphill fight and you know how tender the

choice, I would like to accept Muriel Lester’s invitation. If however
you think that it would be better not to do so and to occupy
Ghanshyam Das’s hostel you will please see her.
And now for the Transvaal question. It is becoming more and
more difficult day after day. Unless India comes to her own in the
near future, I see no prospect of improvement in the situation. Of
course the resident Indian population will somehow drag on its
existence there. They have sufficient resourcefulness but it would be
living from hand to mouth. However we must do all we can. Yours I
know is just now the largest share. I have become almost incapacitated
for that work. But when we meet we must discuss the situation and I
might be able to find out some effective method of dealing with it.
I hope yor are getting your copy of Young India. This letter is
merely a supplement to that weekly letter.

5. LETTER TO C. VIJAYARAGHAVACHARIAR
BORSAD,
April 29, 1931
DEAR FRIEND,
Ghanshyam Das Birla asks me to write to you if it is only a few
lines. I have failed because up to last week I had practically ceased to
deal with voluminous correspondence that comes daily. Pyarelal and
Mahadev dealt with it as they liked and I knew that in that pressure
you did not expect anything from me. And now that I have a few
moments to dictate some letters what shall I say to you? Why do you
think that because you had no acknowledgments, your wires and
letters were not considered? They were. But the unfortunate fact is that
your suggestion could not be accepted. The legality of the convic-
tions1 was discussed threadbare by jurists like Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru
with the Viceroy and you know what great influence he had with him.
But it was all of no avail. The Congress therefore had to take up the
only attitude that was open to it. I would ask you please therefore not
to be sensitive. Remember that we have a new generation of men and
women dominating the Congress. They brush aside legal forms. They
1  Of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru4      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhave found by experience how powerless these forms have proved for
advancing freedom and they have by bitter experience realized how
powerful they have been for curbing freedom. Why will you not
therefore be satisfied with blessing these young men and women
knowing that they are, on the whole, on the right track[?] This of
course does not mean that you should not continue to give the
Congress and especially me the benefit of your advice. But that you
should do without expectation of its being always followed. I hope, in
spite of old age creeping on you, you are well and able to follow the
vast changes that are taking place in the country.
Yours sincerely,

[AS AT] SABARMATI ,
April 29, 1931
MY DEAR GOVIND,
I have your letter and I read your letter to Mira. I quite
understand and appreciate all the anxiety shown by you in your letter
to her. I do not know that I shall be going to London at all and I shall
certainly not go if the way is not clear for me to deliver my message.
That it is not likely to be accepted just now I have realized all along.
But had the Congress not accepted the offer to discuss terms, the
Congress would have put itself in the wrong. As it is we are safe either
way. It will be great, good and grand if peace can be made permanent
through negotiation. I shall therefore leave no stone unturned to reach
that state but it will be equally good and grand if the negotiations
proved fruitless. Then India will be put upon her mettle and will have
to show her capacity for further suffering. There is no question of my
being invited to parties, feted and lionized. I can eat nothing and
thank God my Ioin-cloth will protect me from being exhibited as a
specimen in Barnum’s show. If therefore I go to London I go for
solid business and to drink in the deep affection of chosen friends
there. I refuse to speculate. I would go where the light leads me in the
fullest faith that all will be well if I follow it.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 5Do not believe the rumours about my intended visit to America.
Much as I should like to visit that great country I know that my time is
not yet and I do not want to come as a nine day’s wonder.
Love to you and Radha.

8. LETTER TO PRABHUDAS GANDHI
BORSAD,
April 29, 1931
CHI. PRABHUDAS,
I have gone through your letter of 19th February 1931, the
budget of the Magan spinning-wheel and the khadi scheme. My
desire of setting up an ashram in Almora still persists. I believe we can
pay upto Rs. 15,000/- if we get a good house. Write to me if you come
across a good place at a reasonable price. I may like to buy it.
I would certainly need a person to run this ashram. At present, I
have only you in mind. You must decide to stay there. Finding fault6      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwith others is a great sin and leads to self-deception. One should not
vie with others. You should utilize whatever you have received as your
share and derive pleasure out of it.
I have not received your.... 1If it is in the Ashram, I will have it
sent to me. Many improvements have been made in “my” spinn-
ing-wheel. Let there be more and call for the sample then. Two
persons are behind it—Laskshmidas and Keshu.
I find your budget for the Magan spinning-wheel all right. Draw
that much money if Chhaganlal and Narandas sanction it. Even if they
do not, send me your spinning-wheel if you want to. I will try to learn
from Padma or anyone who knows how to ply it.
Your khadi scheme is no doubt impracticable. Its conditions are
very difficult. Give it up for the time being. Do whatever you can by
raising men and money there. These are my views. I am sending this
letter to Chhaganlal. He will send it to you after reading it. Let me
know if he has made any changes.
Today 1 am in Borsad. Who knows about tomorrow?

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
Now for the last eight days or so, I am able to write a few letters.
That is to say, I have that much time, mainly after the morning
prayers. That is true of today also. I can say that my health on the
whole is good. I do not have any after-effects of fever now. Whatever
after-effect I had, was from exhaustion. Even now I need rest. I can
take that while working and I am doing that.
I have your letter. I have your earlier one also. It is good news
that both of you are keeping well. I am happy that you have got the
work of your liking. I do not at all like . . .2 Vijapur. He has not even
thought about it. I feel like writing to Diwan directly. Do you think it

2 A few words here are illegible in the source.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 7is necessary? The owner of the neighbouring land died but his heirs
would be there. Find out.
I have come to Borsad as there is a danger of Government
reprisal here. With me are Ba, Mirabehn, Mahadev, Pyarelal and a
young man from Utkal. We will have to stay here for a few days. I will
decide after that. I will have to go either to Mahabaleshwar or Simla or
Nainital.1 I do not foresee my going to Europe.

10. LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA
BORSAD,
April 29, 1931
BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
I have your two letters. I send you a copy of the letter2 I have
written to Vijayaraghavachariji.
What shall I write about the Hindu-Muslim problem? The
Nawab of Bhopal is doing something. Whenever you have an oppor-
tunity of rendering service to a Muslim you should do so. It does not
mean financial assistance. Financial assistance of course has to be
rendered in the case of a deserving but poor Mussalman. And it is also
our duty to try and remove the rowdyism among Hindus. The atroci-
ties committed by Hindus in Cawnpore and Kashi do not help the
Hindu religion, but undoubtedly harm it.
I have as yet no idea whether I am to go to England or not. The
situation here is rather serious.
Do go to America. It will certainly do some good.
Do whatever is possible for the boycott of foreign cloth.
I am well.

A critic has fallen foul of my remark made before the meeting
of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce at Delhi that the Indian
civilization must not be allowed to be wiped out by the inroads from
the West. The critic has confused Indian civilization with the loin-cloth
and then condemned it.
Mr. Churchill has been kind enough gratuitously to advertise
my loin-cloth to the whole world. It has therefore become the fashion
to laugh at it as the said critic has done. Let me then explain what it
means.
In 1921 Maulana Mahomed Ali was arrested at Waltair whilst he
and I were going on a tour to the South.1 He was torn from Begum
Mahomed Ali who was travelling with us. I was deeply moved, she
bore the separation bravely and attended meetings in Madras. I left
her at Madras and went as far as Madura. On the way I saw in our
compart-ment crowds that were wholly unconcerned with what had
happened. Almost without exception they were bedecked in foreign
fineries. I entered into conversation with some of them and pleaded
for khadi. For I had no other way open to me to secure the release of
the Ali Brothers save through khadi. They shook their heads as they
said, “We are too poor to buy khadi and it is so dear.” I realized the
substratum of truth behind the remark. I had my vest, cap, and full
dhoti on. When these uttered only partial truth, the millions of com-
pulsory naked men, save for their langoti four inches wide and nearly
as many feet long, gave through their bare limbs the naked truth.
What effective answer could I give them, if it was not to divest myself
of every inch of clothing I decently could and thus to a still greater
extent bring myself in a line with the ill-clad masses? And this I did
the very next morning after the Madura meeting?2
Here then there is no question of loin-cloth civilization. The
adoption of the loin-cloth was for me a sheer necessity. But in so far
as the loin-cloth also spells simplicity let it represent Indian civiliza-
tion. It is a mingling of the cultures represented by the different faiths
and influenced by the geographic and other environment in which the
cultures have met. Thus Islamic culture is not the same in Arabia,
Turkey, Egypt and India but it is itself influenced by the conditions of
1 Vide “Message to Bomba Citizens”, 14-9-1921
2 Held on September 22, 1921; videVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 9the respective countries. Indian cult-ure is therefore Indian. It is
neither Hindu, Islamic nor any other, wh-olly. It is a fusion of all and
essentially Eastern. I had in mind that cu-lture. And every one who
called himself or herself an Indian is bound to treasure that culture, be
its trustee and resist any attack upon it.
European civilization is no doubt suited for the Europeans but it
will mean ruin for India, if we endeavour to copy it. This is not to say
that we may not adopt and assimilate whatever may be good and
capable of assimilation by us as it does not also mean that even the
Europeans will not have to part with whatever evil might have crept
into it. The incessant search for material comforts and their multipli-
cation is such an evil, and I make bold to say that the Europeans
themselves will have to remodel their outlook, if they are not to perish
under the weight of the comforts to which they are becoming slaves. It
may be that my reading is wrong, but I know that for India to run
after the Golden Fleece is to court certain death. Let us engrave on
our hearts the motto of a Western philosopher, “Plain living and high
thinking”. Today it is certain that the millions cannot have high living
and we the few who profess to do the thinking for the masses run the
risk, in a vain search after high living, of missing high thinking.

12. HE LIVES BY DYING
Sjt. G. V. Ketkar writes of an example of great bravery which is
worthy of record:
Sjt. Purushottam, who was popularly known as Bapu Gayadhani, was a
young worker of Nasik. For the past few years he was working as assistant
Secretary of the Gulalwadi public gymnasium of Nasik. He was also
occasionally taking part in Congress and swadeshi propaganda. On the 4th of
April a house in Nasik caught fire. Bapu Gayadhani took leading part in the
work of quenching the fire. On learning that there were children in the house
he rushed in without caring for consequences and rescued all the children. He
re-entered the house to save the cattle also. Unfortunately the fire had spread
all over the house and burning beam crashed over his head. He was badly burnt
and bruised all over his body and was taken to the civil hospital where he
succumbed to his injuries on the 11th instant.”10      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIHis parents, if they are alive, should be proud of their brave son.
Bapu Gayadhani lives through his glorious death.

13. THE GUJARAT FARMER
“Give a dog a bad name and hang him.” Say that the Gujarat
farmer is contumacious and sell him out. In a Press interview1 I said
some days ago that it was unfortunate that Mr. Benn was misled into
saying that the Gujarat farmer was not playing the game; in other
words, he was not paying up. When the suggestion was first made I
was startled, for I had faith that the Gujarat farmer though hit hard
would carry out the terms of the Settlement to the full extent of his
ability. The Settlement expects nothing more.
The complaint made to me in Delhi was that whereas large sums
were collected in Bardoli and Valod before 28th February, only Rs.
3,212 were collected during the fortnight ending 15th March. The
implication was that since the Settlement very little was paid.
Now, the Settlement was announced on 7th March. Sardar
Vallabhbhai and I reached Bardoli on 14th March. It is clear that
nothing could be expected before we arrived in Bardoli and explained
the position to the farmers and they could return to their homes. Here,
however, are the figures of payment:

I claim that the Bardoli farmers have done exceedingly well and
this in spite of the fact that the forfeited lands had not yet been
returned, that some of these had even been sold, that the old Patels and
Talatis had not been reinstated, that all the prisoners had not been
released and that prosecutions against them were still pending.
But here I must draw the curtain. I may say that great difficulty
is being experienced in establishing friendly touch with the local
officials. The result is that many things that should have long ago
been done on behalf of the Government are still not done and though
there is no unwil-lingness to pay, threats of coercive measures are kept
hanging like Damo-cles’s word over the heads of the people. The
process has begun with Kaira. They do not seem to realize that there is
peace now, provisial though it is, between the people and the
Government and that efforts are being made to make enduring what is12      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHItoday only temporary and provisional.
The difficulties in the way are enormous. But I have pledged  
my word  to Lord Irwin that so far as it is humanly possible, I shall
prevent the Truce from breaking. The Settlement has been called a
gentleman’s agreement. I know that Lord Irwin was sincerely anxious
to see that it was fully carried out by the Government’s agents as he
testified more than once that I was to see it being as fully carried out
by Congressmen.
It has hurt me to take the public into confidence even to the
extent I have done. But I feel that I can no longer suppress the fact
that there are ominous signs on the horizon. A satyagrahi has no
weapon at his disposal but that of public opinion and suffering. Let
the public read no more into this article than the natural meaning the
written word conveys. I shall hope and pray that next week I may be
able to report that the threatenig cloud has lifted.

14. OUR DUTY TO THE VILLAGERS
The intensive political struggle of last year brought out
prominently the importance of foreign-cloth boycott in the fight for
national freedom. That the boycott programme has been in a measure
effective, is evidenced by the fall in the import of foreign cloth. We
have reason for satisfaction in the results achieved, but let us not in
our satisfaction at the measure of success gained, forget the true pur-
pose and implications of the boycott programme. Let us remember
that our nation lives in the millions of village homes and the true and
primary aim of the boycott programme will be missed if the boycott is
not worked in such a way that the benefits accrue pre-eminently to the
villagers. If it is to benefit them it can only be by the nation according
to khadi a position above all other indigenous cloth.
In order to do this it is necessary for us to revise our taste. We
must take to coarse, thick khadi. The cotton grown in India is mostly
short stapled and can yield only low count yarn. The spinners who
have been spinning generally only for themselves or the neighbour-
hood are accustomed in most of the areas only to the spinning of
coarse yarn   and it is difficult therefore at once to raise the count of
yarn spun. This is the case with practically the whole of North India.
In the Punjab, Rajasthan, U. P., Bihar, and Bengal, where lakhs ofVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 13unemployed or partlaily employed charkhas exist, only thich khadi is
being woven. A limited quantity of fine and medium khadi is avai-
lable in the South, but even there the largest quantity is only made of
low count yarn. The activities under the auspices of the All-India
Spinners’ Association, much as they have grown, have not touched
even a tenth of the known and definitely ascertained facilities for
production in these provinces. There are practicially no limits to the
possibilities of thick khadi production and if only the nation can give
its reasoned preference to thick khadi, it can to a very large extent
take the place till now occupied by foreign cloth and the fruits of the
national programme will go to benefit the vast majority of the popu-
lation of the country and not merely the moneyed few.
This general plea for khadi from the point of view of the boy-
cott is further strengthened by one peculiar feature of the economic
situation of the country in the current year and the year that is past.
The abnormally low prices of cotton and indeed of all agricultural
produce, have caused great distress in the villages. The prices prevail-
ing do not, in many cases, fully meet even the cultivation and other
expenses. The smaller cultivators of cotton, therefore, have sought to
earn something more on their cotton by plying one or two spinning
wheels in their homes. The cultivators of other agricultural produce
have also similarly sought to add to their scanty income by spinning.
The result is that in many parts of the country spinners from
surrounding villages in great numbers flock to the nearest khadi
depots offering the yarn for sale. The output of hand-spun yarn even
before last year was very much more than what the existing depots
could manage. But now the position has become more difficult still.
With their very limited capital resources the depots  are unable to take
in all the yarn and have therefore to turn away many  of the spinners.
If the demand for khadi can be increased the consequent increased
turn-over may enable the depots to afford a greater amount of relief
to the spinners. More private capital may also flow into khadi, as to
some extent it did last year. Both from the general viewpoint of the
boycott, therefore, as well as the affording of immediate relief for
present distress the duty of the country to give preference  to khadi is
obvious.
If large numbers of people. even if they feel it difficult to wear a
khadi dhoti or sari because of its heaviness, choose only khadi for
their other requirements—towels, shirting, coating, and bed sheets,
carpets, and the like—it will become possible not merely to absorb all14      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthe hand-spun yarn that is produced today but also many times the
present output. It requires only a proper exercise of imagination to
realize all the possibilities. And if we would adapt our dress to the
climatic requirements and the resources of villagers, we would discard
the many articles, reduce   the size of the dhoti or sari, change the
turban for the cap and in the bargain secure greater comfort and
greater cleanliness, not to speak of the great reduction in the cost of
clothes.

15. WHAT IS THE TRUTH?
Sjt. S. D. Nadkarni of Karwar writes a letter from which I take
the following:
I have just noticed that in a letter addressed to you and already published
in the Press Mr. Mushir Hussain Kidwai, one of the leaders of the ‘All-Parties
Muslim Conference’, referring to the minority problem in Egypt, says: ‘In my
opinion, the attitude of the Hindus here should be what Zaglul’s was in Egypt,
i.e., they should sign blindfolded the demands of the minority. . . .’
Without concerning myself here with any other statement made by Mr.
Kidwai in his letter to you, I should like to draw your attention to the true fact
about the one above, where a parallel is sought to be drawn from Egyptian
politics. The enclosed excerpt from a leading article in the Servant of India  of
August 15, 1929, whose writer had to deal with a similar statement made about
that time by Sir Ibrahim Rahimatoola, will show you how the truth about
affairs in Egypt (where the Muslims are the majority, and the native Christians
called Copts are the minority) is just the opposite of what your correspondent
Mr. Kidwai would have you believe.
Every single statement in the excerpt, I am sure, can be vouched for by
reference to any work on contemporary history or any standard work of
reference.
From the excerpt referred to by Sjt. Nadkarni, the following
relevent parts are taken:
Indeed Sir Ibrahim seems to have misread history. Look, for instance, at
what he says about Egypt. In pleading for a generous treatment to be meted out
by the majority community to minority communities, he cites the example of
what Saad Pasha Zaglul did to the Christians in Egypt. He appears to think that
Zaglul’s sensitive regard for the rights and interests of the Copts persuaded
the latter to accept the rule of the Moslems. The facts, however, are just theVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 15contrary. It is the throwing in by the Copts of their lot unreservedly with the
nationalists in Egypt that has persuaded the Muslims to treat them so liberally
as they have done. The Copts were not entirely free from persecution before.
The improvement was solely due to the fact that they were not only not hostile
or indifferent to the national campaign for freedom, but took a very prominent
part in the Wafd. This was a very wise policy for the Coptic community ot
follow, to which they owe the inclusion of Copts in the Ministry.
I give the extract for what it is worth. I have verified neither the
statement made in the extract nor the one to which it purports to be an
answer. Nor am I interested in it except for the sake of truth.
As a satyagrahi I believe in the absolute efficacy of full
surrender. Numerically Hindus happen to be the major community.
Withour reference therefore to what the Egyptian majority did they
may give to the minorities what they may want. But even if the Hindus
were in a minority, as a satyagrahi and Hindu I should say that the
Hindus would lose nothing in the long run by full surrender.
To this argument a retort has thoughtlessly been made, ‘Why
then do you not advise India to surrender to the English? Give them
the domination they want and be happy.’ The hasty retort ignores the
vital fact that I have not advised surrender to the baynet. In the code
of the satyagrahi there is no such thing as surrender to brute force. Or
the surrender then is the surrender of suffering and not to the will of
the wielder of the bayonet. A satyagrahi’s surrender has to come out
of his strength, not out of weakness. The surrender advised by me is
not of honour but of earthly goods. There is no loss of honour in
surrendering seats and positions of emoluments. There is loss of
honour in haggling about them. Let the Englishmen give up the
bayonet and live in our midst as simple friends and I should plead for
them. The law of surrender and suffering is a universal law admitting
of no exceptions.

18. INTERVIEW TO “FOX MOVIETONE NEWS”
BORSAD,
[April 30, 1931  ]1
The following is the full text of the interview intended for the Talkie that the
Fox Movietone News  and the Associated Press of America had with Mahatma Gandhi at
Borsad. The copy has been corrected by Gandhiji before releasing for publication,
says The Bombay Chronicle.
Mr. Gandhi prefixed the interview with the following remarks:
I do not like this kind of thing, but I shall reconcile myself to it, if not
more than a few minutes have to be given: Although I know this sort
of enterprise will advertise you, which is your primary object, I know
also that it will serve to advertise the cause which I represent—India’s
independence. I do not discount the value of propaganda. I have been
described as the greatest propagandist in the world. I may deserve the
compliment. But my propaganda is unlike the ordinary. It is that of
truth which is self-propagating. Truth abhors artificiality.
You will therefore excuse me for declining to pose for you from
which, apart from the reason I have given above, I am debarred by a
solemn vow I made in 1905.
1 From The Hindu,   1-5-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 17He therefore declined to give a sitting in a suitable courtyard. The interview
took place in his room.
Q.Mr. Gandhi, Fox Movietone News and the Associated Press of America,
which combined, reach an audience of several hundred million people throughour   the
world, have sent us their representatives across the Seven Seas from New York to
India to see if you wil be good enough to give the American people, through the
medium of Fox Movietone News, a message of greeting and friendship. As you
probably know, there is a great deal of interest and sympathy in the United States for
India’s struggle for independence, because America itself had a similar struggle for
liberation 150 years ago.
A.I appreciate all the interest and sympathy America has 
shown in our struggle, and I hope we shall be able to retain the
friendship and goodwill of the American people to the end of our
struggle.
Q.When do you expect to visit America?
A.Much as I should like to visit your country, I have abso-
lutely no notion about it except that I should not like to visit America
until the present struggle for India’s freedom has proved demons-
trably successful.
When do you expect to leave for London for the second Round Table 
Conference?
About this also, I have no idea, except that I don’t expect to go
to London unless the Hindu-Muslim communal question is satisfac-
torily solved. Of course, if there should be a break in the present
Truce, I will not go to London at all.
Have you given Lord Irwin any written message for the British Prime
Minister?
It is wholly wrong to say I gave Lord Irwin any such message
for Mr. MacDonald.
Do you expect England will grant all your demands at the second Round Table
Conference?
It is more than I can say.
But you are really hopeful England will this time grant your demands?
All I can say is I am an optimist.
If England does not give you what you want, what course of action will you
follow?
Of course, Civil Disobedience and all other phases of satya-
graha, (obedience to the principles of truth) are always at our  dispo-18      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIsal. But Whether we shall resort to these weapons immediately, or what
other steps we shall take, it is not possible to say offhand at present.
Are you prepared to go back to jail if England refuses to grant your demands?
I am always ready to go to jail in the cause of India’s freedom.
Are you willing to die in such a cause?
That is a bad question.
If England should accede to your demands, do you intend to have complete
prohibition in the new Indian State?
Yes, I expect to see absolute prohibition enforced in the new
Indian State.
Do you intend to abolish child-marriages when the new Indian State is
established?
I should very much like to see child-marriages abolished even
before that time.
Do you expect in the new Indian State to exterminate the present caste system
which makes social outcastes of India’s so-called sixty million “untouchables”?
Most decidedly.
Do you intend to abolish the present system of Indian widows living lives of
strict seclusion and celibacy?
There is nothing now to prevent widows from remarrying if they
so wish. It is likewise wholly wrong to say, or to suggest, that Indian
widows in general live in seclusion.
I refer to the system of widows living in purdah.
 The system of purdah is in fact confined to a very small 
number of the middle-class people, and that too not over the whole of
India.
In the new Indian State, do you expect there will be complete communal social
unity and harmony between Hindus and Muslims?
I certainly look forward to seeing complete social harmony and
unity established between these two great branches of the Indian
family in the new State.
If the King of England invites you to dinner at Buckingham Palace when you
attend the second Round Table Conference, will you dress in native Indian attire or
will you appear in European dress?
It would be a discourtesy to the King for me to appear in any
dress other than my customary Indian apparel. If the weather permits,
I shall dress in England exactly as I do in India, that is, in loin-cloth.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 19Mr. Gandhi, you have frequently said that you number among the British 
people some of your best friends and partisans. Will you be kind enough to give a
brief message of greeting to those friends and other members of the great British
public, through British Movietone News,  which reaches a vast audience throughout the
British Empire?
I am glad to be able to say that the circle of my British friends is
increasing. It could not be otherwise, as the present satyagraha
movement, however much it may be mixed with dress, is nothing but a
movement for promoting the establishment of goodwill with those
against whom we seem to be fighting. Therefore, I have no misgivings
as to the ultimate result.
Will you give to the world a new Decalogue, or a new Ten Commandments in
the light of present-day needs?
That is too big an order.

[May 1, 1931  ]1
DEAR MR. COLLINS,
I had hoped to be able to write to you about the various cases I
had in mind. But I am sorry I am not yet ready. I write this therefore
purely about Mr. Rajwade’s case.
You told me he was not discharged because he had incited to
violence. I have now got the certified record of the case and the writ-
ing on which the case was based. The charge-sheet has ‘committing
an act which is to the prejudice of good order and of public safety
and evading arrest’. There is no violence here.
I have read the writing in the original Marathi. It is an
unvarnished report of the events. So far as I can see, there is not a
trace of incitement to violence in the report. In my opinion, therefore,
the case clearly falls within the Settlement.
If there is any other writing placed before the court you will
please let me have it. If there is nothing more, I hope Mr. Rajwade will
be discharged without delay.
Yours sincerely,

BORSAD,
May 2, 1931
There was no Patel who had not expressed the desire to resume
service and there was no question of giving an assurance of working
faithfully. That assurance was implied in the resumption of service.
Such terms were, at the beginning stages of the settlement, issued to
Patels, and on complaint being made by me, they were withdrawn.
If 25 per cent of forfeited lands has not been returned, because
owners had not paid land revenue, it is a distinct breach of clause 17 B
of the Settlement, because forfeited lands have to be returned unless
there is reasonable ground for supposing that there is any contumacy
on the part of the holder. It is common ground that there is no
question of contumacy in Bardoli or any of the effected districts.
It is wholly wrong to suggest that there is lack of discipline in
any of the Congress camps and whilst I have pressed every one of the
Congress workers to implement the terms of peace as zealously as
they fought during the struggle I have had no occasion to admonish
any of the workers.
On the contrary, it gives me great joy to find complete response
to every one of the instructions given to the workers. I have no
knowledge of any worker in Congress organizations, especially in the
districts of Surat and Kaira on which Vallabhbhai Patel and I are
concentrating attention, having been dismissed for embezzlement of
Congress funds except one unfortunate case.

mine was a self-imposed exile but I can easily make it a rule of three

much more must enforced exile be to friends like you. If things shape
themsel-ves properly, exiles won’t have to remain away at the outside

33. A TWENTIETH CENTURY SATI (?)1
I
I hope that the incident as reported in the Press is not true and
that the lady in question died through illness or through accident, not
by suicide. A sati has been described by our ancients, and the
description holds good today, as one who ever fixed in her love and
devotion to her husband signalizes herself by her selfless service
during her husband’s lifetime as well as after, and remains absolutely
chaste in thought, word and deed. Self-immolation at the death of the
husband is not a sign of enlightenment but of gross ignorance as to
the nature of the soul. The soul is immortal, unchangeable and
immanent. It does not perish with the physical body but journeys on
from one mortal frame to another till it completely emancipated itself
from earthly bondage. The truth of it has been attested to by the
experience of countless sages and seers and can be realized by anyone
who may wish to even today. How can suicide be then justified in the
light of these facts?
Again true marriage means not merely union of bodies. It
connotes the union of the sould too. If marriage meant no more than
a physical relationship the bereaved wife shouls be satisfied with a
portrait or a waxen image of her husband. But self-destruction is
worse than futile. It cannot help to restore the dead to life, on the
contrary it only takes away one more from the world of the living.
The ideal that marriage aims at is that of spiritual union through
the physical. The human love that it incarnates in intended to serve as
1 The Gujarati original of this appeared in Navajivan   3-5-1931.  This is a
translation by Pyarelal, with the following introductory note : “A lady correspondent
from Ghatkopar having invited Gandhiji to express his opinion on an alleged case of
sati  that was recently reported in a Bombay vernacular paper Gandhiji has delivered
himself on the subject in an article in the Navajivan   as follows.”  Vide  also
“Opinion Unchanged”,  17-5-1931.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 27a stepping-stone to the divine or universal love. That is why immortal
Mira sang : “God alone is my husband—none else.”
It follows from this that a sati would regard marriage not as a
means of satisfying the animal appetite but as a means of  realizing
the ideal of selfless and self-effacing service by completely merging
her individuality in her husband’s.  She would prove her satihood not
by mounting the funeral pyre at her husband’s death but she would
prove it with every breath that she breathes from the moment that she
plighted her troth to him at the saptapadi1 ceremony, by her renun-
ciation, sacrifice, self-abnegation and dedication to the service of her
husband, his family and the country. She would shun creature com-
forts and delights of the senses. She would refuse to be enslaved by
the narrow domestic cares and interests of the family, but would utilize
every opportunity to add to her stock of knowledge and increase her
capacity for service by more and more cultivating renunciation and
self-discipline, and by completely identifying herself with her
husband, learn to indentify herself with the whole world.
Such a sati would refuse to give way to wild grief at the death of
her husband but would ever strive to make her late husband’s ideals
and virtues live again in her actions and thereby win for him the
crown [of] immortality. Knowing that the soul of him whom she
married is not dead but still lives she will never think of remarrying.
The reader will here be perhaps tempted to ask, “The sati that
you have pictured is a being untouched by passion or animal appetite.
She can have no desire for offspring. Why should she marry at all?”
The reply is that in our present-day Hindu society, marriage, in a vast
majority of cases, is not a matter of choice. Again, there are some who
believe that in our ramshackle age marriage is necessary as a shield to
virtue and as an aid to selfrestraint. And as a matter of fact, I
personally know several instances of persons who, though at the time
of the marriage, were not free from animal passion later on became
imbued with the ideal of obsolute chastity and found in their married
life a powerful means for realizing their ideal. I have cited these
instances to show that the ideal of sati that I have depicted is not
merely a counsel of perfection that has no place outside the world of
1 Seven steps28      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHItheory but something that has to be lived up to and realized in this
very matter of fact world of ours.
But I readily concede that the average wife who strives to attain
the ideal of sati will be a mother too. She must therefore add to her
various other qualities mentioned above a knowledge of rearing and
bringing up children so that they might live to be true servants of their
country.
All that I have said about the wife applies equally to the
husband. If the wife has to prove her loyalty and undivided devotion
to her husband so has the husband to prove his allegiance and
devotion to his wife. You cannot have one set of weights and measures
for the one and a different one for the other. Yet we have never heard
of a husband mounting the funeral pyre of his deceased wife. It may
therefore be taken for granted that the practice of the widow
immolating herself at the death of her husband had its origin in
superstitious ignorance and the blind egotism of man. Even if it could
be proved that at one time the practice had a meaning, it can only be
regarded as barbarous in the present age. The wife is not the slave of
the husband but his comrade, otherwise known as his better half, his
colleague and friend. She is a co-sharer with him of equal rights and
of equal duties. Their obligations towards each other and towards the
world must, therefore, be the same and reciprocal.
I therefore regard the alleged self-immolation of this sister as
vain. It certainly cannot be set up as an example to be copied. Don’t I
appreciate at least her courage to die?— I may perhaps be asked. My
reply is ‘no’ in all conscience. Have we not seen even evil-doers
display this sort of courage? Yet no one has ever thought of compli-
menting them on it. Why should I take upon me the sin of even
unconsciously leading astray some ignorant sister by my injudicious
praise of suicide? Satihood is the acme of purity. This purity cannot
be attained or realized by dying. It can be attained only through
constant striving, constant immolation of the spirit from day to day.

34. NOTES
TO   CORRESPONDENTS1
Letters rain down on me. Even if I am in absolutely good 
1 A similar item “To Private and Personal Correspondents,”  under “Notes”,
also appeared in Young India,  7-5-1931.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 29health, I can neither read all those letters immediately nor can I  
reply to them. In my present delicate state of health, it is impossible to
cope with those letters, to attend to the Settlement, to write for
Navajivan  and Young India  and do other jobs. Hence only a  select
unmber of letters are put up to me and from among   these I reply
immediately to as many as I can and deal later  with the rest. I am not
happy about this situation. I know that my correspondents expect
timely replies. But my helplessness is my defence. My correspon-
dents can help me and my co-workers. They should oblige me by
abiding by the following conditions :
1.They should not write letters unless absolutely necessary.
2.They should not use lead pencils for writing.
3.They should not write long letters.
4.They should not repeat the same arguments again and
again.
5.As far as possible, they should not argue at all.
6.They should write in a beautiful hand.
These rules are simple and all stem from non-violence. My
handwriting is very poor. I have full experience of what difficulties
readers find in deciphering it. To do anything which causes hardship
to others implies violence. Hence everyone can see that bad hand
writing constitutes violence. The same can be said in regard to the
other conditions. The above rules have permanent application and, in
my present state of health, they are doubly relevant. Be that as it may,
if my correspondents receive no replies, they should not conclude that
this is due to lack of civility.
‘THERE IS NO BASIS FOR UNITY’
The second question1 posed by the same correspondent is as
follows:
There is imperfect reasoning underlying this question.
Distinctions such as those which have been described are there for
other reasons even in countries like England and the United States of
America; despite this there is political unity in those countries.
Moreover, it is only in cities that some of the distinctions mentioned
above are to be found. There are no distinctions in villages. What is
1 Not translated here.  The correspondent had pointed out the artificial
separation of Hindus and Muslims in various fields and suggested that these barriers
be broken. For the first question, vide  “Power of Ahimsa”, 7-5-193130      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIrequired is not the so-called unity achieved through schools,
gymkhanas or through games and sports. Unity of hearts is all that is
necessary. If this cannot be had, all else is futile; if this is accompli-
shed, nothing else is necessary.

May 3, 1931
It is a common cause between us that the people should pay
revenue to the utmost of their capacity. I know that in defining the
word “capacity” there may be a difference, or there is a difference as
I now see from your letter. During our talk I thought that you agreed
that no one need borrow money in order to pay the revenue dues. I
am carrying out that healthy formula. I know that is has not been
carried out before, and may not be carried out in future. In any case,
for this exceptional year, I think that there is no way our of it, as I
hope to show conclusively in due course. This of course, does not
mean that those who wish to pay by borrowing should be prevented
by me from doing so. Only I could not take it upon me to press them
to do so.2

[AS AT] SABARMATI ,
May 3, 1931
MY DEAR HARIDAS1,
Your letter of 26th March2 and the snatch from your diary have
come upon me as a surprise. Your certificate could not be worth much
if a cablegram containing a garbled report of my doings or even an
act of mine truthfully reported which you could not understand
should create such a revulsion in you as to undo your previous certifi-
cate. Do you see the terrible implication, namely, that your first certi-
ficate was based upon just as hasty calculation as your recantation?
But more surprising still is your protestation that your personal
loyalty remained as deep, intense, whole-hearted and unquestioning as
it was a year ago. Do you not see the flat contradiction between this
statement and your latest opinion of me? Surely your loyalty had no
other foundation than your estimate of me and when your estimate
had to be revised your loyalty became baseless. If you have kept
copies of your letters you will understand more fully than I can
convey the implications of your letters. However there is this
consolation for me that I have survived ruder shocks than you have
given.
Yours sincerely,

CHI. KISHORELAL,
I have your letter. Doctors have divided their work into so
many branches that sometimes they make great mistakes which we
never know about. A specialist in ear diseases does not understand
diseases of the chest, and a throat specialist does not understand
inflammation of the stomach. As a result a number of doctors lay
siege to the same body and make a mess of the patient’s condition. But
on the whole they are honest and so it is better to die at their hands.

I was anxiously awaiting your letter. I am thankful you have

congratulations till I see some definite shape being given to the work.
If it is to be lasting it must touch the masses. And you will not touch
the masses until you fulfil two conditions :
1.Your programme must appeal to the Mussalman mass
mind. It must therefore be in their interest.
2.You must have an army of workers to give effect to it.
Why do you say I have broken the contract? Have I spoken or
written about the question anything in contravention of the contract? I
could not very well reject Bhopal’s well intentioned advances. And
after all he was to hae sent for you all to discuss the possibilities. Since
our meeting in Bombay, I have heard nothing from him. Nor have I

There will be one more burden on you. Jamnadas will tell you
about Ratilal2. When he arrives there, lodge him in the bungalow. If he

Call in Dr. Kanuga and Dr. Haribhai. Pay them their fees and do as
they advise. Dr. Haribhai may keep Ratilal in his own hospital or may
get him admitted to the asylum, as he thinks best. It is possible that he
will come round. All the same, it will be necessary to be careful about

which is not available.

It does not matter if you have to engage a person especially for that
and pay him. I don’t wish that you should have to spend much of
your time over this, but you have to accept the responsibility. Perhaps
Ratilal may respond to love. If Champa1 accompanies him, I don’t
think she will be able to stay with him. If she comes, let her stay in the
Ashram. But she may certainly stay with him if she herself has the
courage to do so.
The  second problem  is about Lakshmi2. She has been so
brought up  that  she will not be happy if she is married to an Antyaja.
Fortunately Maruti wishes to marry her. Read Lakshmidas’s letter and
let me have your opinion. From a moral stand-point, the proposed
step seems to me justified and even necessary. Even then I wish to

BORSAD,
May 5, 1931
DEAR DIWAN SAHEB,
In Vijapur there is an industrial institution called Udyoga-  
laya. I procured through the good office of your predecessor a     plot
of ground for founding a centre for spinning and weaving  
especially through women and it was registered in the name of a lady
co-worker. She has now retired from that work and so far as she is
concerned the legal right has been transferred to the trustees of the
Satyagraha Ashram. One of the trustees is working in the Udyogalaya.
He has tried to get the land transferred in the name of the trustees of
the Satyagraha Ashram. After waiting a long time the officer
concerned has rejected the application. He has given, so far as I am
aware, no reasons for it. At one time it seemed that by giving an
undertaking that the institution will have nothing to do with politics
there would be no difficulty about the transfer. Then, I believe, there
was a change of officer. Of course, from its very conception accord-
ing to my own method of work like my activities in other Indian
States, this institution has been kept out of politics altogether. It
remained so during the last struggle. As you may be aware, theVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           41Baroda State has been receiving the help of the All-India Spinners’
Association for village reorganization through the spinning-wheel.
The Vijapur activity is also a kindred activity. Could I trouble you to
interest yourself in this matter and if you are satisfied about the facts
presented by me, could you please order transfer of the land in the
name of the above-mentioned trustees? At the present moment this
land is given by the State for a nominal sum for benevolent purposes.
But I would like to buy it right out if the State has no objection. It was
offered before. I may add that we have buildings on this land which
have cost over Rs. 12,000. Through the institution we are supporting
several poor women of Vijapur by giving them spinning work and we
are supporting a colony of weavers and carders. The institution
engages in no other activity. I am sorry to have to trouble you over a
matter which may appear to be trifling. But it is not so to me as a
guardian of the several interests entrusted to my care.

MY DEAR BOYD,
I was delighted to have your letter and to find that you were
having a little respite from the heat of India’s plains. Of course there
is no truth in the rumoured visit to America. But as soon as the
rumour went abroad, I got a peremptory cablegram signed by Mr.
Page, Dr. Sherwood Eddy, Rev. Holmes, Dr. Ward and others warning
me against going to America.1 They say emphatically that I would be
exploited if I went there and that I would serve the cause better from a
distance than by appearing in the midst of the people of America. All
this, mind you, in the cablegram. And by this mail I have received a
letter from an unknown American friend who, whilst appreciating my
work and message, pleads with me not go to America. I do feel
1 Vide also “Notes” sub-title A Cry in The Wilderness”, 14-5-193142       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIexactly like these friends. Therefore even if I went to London and
could spare a few weeks I should not care to go in the teeth of these
warnings from friends whose opinion I respect. Would not yours
coincide1 with theirs after further reflection?
Now about London. There is no probability of my going there
so long as the Hindu-Muslim problem remains unsolved. Even if I
went there, whilst I should value your society, I do not know of the use
I could make of your services. Andrews is already there and as you
know he will take possession of me body and soul. I have a letter from
him in which he takes my London visit for granted, has appointed
himself as my chap-rasi, tells me where I should stay. There is again
Henry Polak who was in my office in South Africa for years. Then
there is Muriel Lester. Therefore if you went with me to London you
would not go as Secretary. Then I must not forget Mira. She will of
course be with me. But of course everything is premature. I felt that
you should now all about the appointments should the visit come
forth. I was glad you were with me in Karachi. I was only sorry that I
was not able to have long chats with you. That you continually lost
your things was certainly bad but that would be no disqualification for
taking you with me. I could have much better use for you than to
make you keeper of my belongings.

and that the Settle-ment is not a surrender of principle. I would like
you to go to him, argue out the matter with him and otherwise help
him and draw him out of his seclusion. He is as good as gold and is
very brave. Perhaps all that I have written to you is superfluous and
that you have met him and had already known more about him than I
have told you. But I could not restrain myself and you can sympa-
thize with me having done such things much more often than I do.
Gujarat still absorbs my attention to the exclusion of everything else.
Implementing the Settlement in the teeth of official sullenness,
unwillingness and even opposition is a very difficult business. It tries
even my patience but I hope not to be baffled. The atmosphere is
already somewhat clearer. I expect next week to go to Simla over this
and other matters arising out of the Settlement as also over the Round
Table Conference. We are no nearer Hindu-Muslim solution and till
that barrier is removed there is no question of my going to London.

BORSAD,
May 5, 1931
People ask me why I am khaddar-mad. There are seven lakhs   
of villages. A large number of these villages are living in a con-  
dition of semi-starvation. There is no employment for them for
nearly six months in the year. It is necessary to find for them some
supplementary occupation. We must give them an occupation they are
used to. Such an occupation is hand-spinning. If hand-spinning is to
be introduced in the villages, it is but natural that we should be
expected to wear khaddar. Hence it is that I have become khaddar-
mad.

BHAI HARIBHAU,
I get your letters. But I have not yet got your acknowledgement
of the telegram I sent you.3 You should have sent one. The telegram
only stated that I would not be able to wire to someone in Udaipur as I
knew no one there, and suggested that Malaviyaji or Jamnalal might
do so. You have written to Ram at any rate. That was good. I do not
even know where Manilal is. I had addressed a telegram to him, to
which there has been no reply.

in the matter. Behaviour of people even after negotiations most harassing.”

may pay no attention to your complaint. Though Trench1 will not be
able to appreciate the letter which you have written to him, you did
well in writing it. It will do no harm. If the people’s grievance has not
been redressed you should, since you have accepted their leader-ship,
cross the border and court imprisonment. If the peasants remain truly
non-violent, they are bound to win. Of course the question will remain
how far non-violence can be observed in taking possession of
land.What will the people do when the State police come to dispossess
them of the land? Will they oppose them? Will they remain there
squatting? Several questions arise here. I have found that the non-
violence observed in such cases is merely physical. Do what you think
right in the light of the circumstances prevailing there, no matter if
what you believe to be non-violence appears to me violence. We can
do nothing more than act sincerely according to our lights. If
everything was as clear to me as daylight I would not have thrown on
you the responsibility for deciding. From what is happening in the
States, for similar things are happening in the other Indian States too
and in British India, it seems to me that the effect of all that happened
during the last struggle was only temporary and not enduring. That
experiment in non-violence was on a mass scale, but it was not, or did
not remain uniformly pure in quality. Our non-violence was the non-
violence of the helpless. I do not feel unhappy about this. Nothing
more than that was possible. The foregoing criticism has no other aim
but to help us to understand the real facts about the nature of the
struggle.
I understand what you say about Tyagbhumi  and also about
advertisements. Do what is possible.
Ramnarayan ought to go somewhere and take complete rest. See
that he gives up work. Perhaps he will have fewer difficulties if he
goes to Almora. Wherever he goes he may be sure that he will get
some opportunity for service.

I was delighted to receive your letter of 10th March. You   will
forgive me for not having acknowledged it earlier. I have been so
busy and constantly on the move. Young students can certainly do a
great deal for the country. First of all they can wear khadi and    thus
support the poor people who spin and weave in their own homes.
They can also do hand-spinning and carding themselves. They will
thus add to national wealth and, when they have finished their studies,
become competent village workers. Young students can also promote
goodwill between the two communities by making friends with one
another and doing all kinds of mutual service and, at times of tension,

I think that Prof. Einstein’s suggestion is sound. And if it is right for

MY DEAR NEEDU,
My whole heart goes out to you in your trouble though, if you
will take it calmly and correctly it will be your making. It is not
prosperity but adversity that makes a man. Prosperity spoils him. 
And after all, if you belong to the starving group, you are one of the
many millions. But I know that this philosophy, however  correct it is,
will bring you no solace. Before therefore I can make a concrete
suggestion, you must let me know what your minimum requirements
are, and in fixing this, do not think of what you have been materially
but think of what you should be.     
In fact in doing this you will have to be courageous and even
apparently heartless. You are telling me you have to support your own
people and Annapurna’s. This is absurd. You have to support those
who may be physically maimed and therefore incapable of doing
anything for themselves. You have no such in either family. Nor must
they be pampered. They must all, men and women, work for their
living and if they will do so, you will find that the problem is
satisfactorily and honourably solved. Now you know what I want from
you. Give me a letter full of particulars and it shall receive prompt
attention.

74. SPEECH AT BOCHASAN
May 6, 1931
I thank you all for giving me the honour of laying the foun-
dation of this Vidyalaya. This institution has been named “Vallabh
Vidyalaya” and hence it has become the duty of all—the present and
future managers of the Vidyalaya and those who will receive
education here—to imbibe Vallabhbhai’s virtues and to teach others
to do the same. Vallabhbhai is an embodiment of sacrifice; Vallabh-
bhai is synonymous with courage; Vallabhbhai stands for heroism, for
removal of distinctions between high and low. Vallab-hbhai does not
regard Patidars as high and the others as low because they are
Bhangis, Baraias and Patanwadias.1 To disprove these distinctions, the
laying of the foundation has been entrusted to me.
Bhai Narahari has stated in his speech that for the most part the
children of Dharala Thakores, and Patanwadias will receive education
in this Vallabh Vidyalaya. I put aside my work and came here only to
meet the Dharala Thakores. Ever since I made your acquaintance, I
have recognized you as Thakores [leaders]. Those brothers among
you who attended the mammoth meeting at Vadtal2 will remember
1 Names of certain beckward communities in Gujarat
2 Vide “Speech at Public Meeting, Vadtal”, 19-1-192154       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthat I had described you all as Dharala Thakores. Just as Kaliparaj1
became Raniparaj, the Dharalas became known as Thakores. You have
only benefited from the great struggle, even though some of you
purchased the lands of others, proved faithless to the people, and
vacillated. But, can one forget the fact that in Bochasan the Baraia
brethren are with the people? That way, no one can claim that the
Patidars are a hundred per cent on the side of the people. If all
Muslim brothers here did not stand by the people, they have done so
in other parts of the country.
There is element of compulsion or force in our struggle, it is a
voluntary fight. Hereafter whenever we have to fight, all will join in. I
wish the temporary Truce with the Government to become permanent.
Let the Truce end in our winning complete swaraj. Complete swaraj
means a government in which we can run our own administration. If
the dream entertained by Sardar Vallabhbhai, my many comrades and
myself comes true, then that government will belong to the Patidars,
the Dharala Thakores and the Bhangis also. It will belong to the
Muslim brethren too. That government will not belong to any one
community, but to all the men and women, boys and girls, of India.
That alone is to be called complete swaraj. A government other than
this is no government. None should hope that the government should
be his and not of the Muslims and the Bhangis. That will indeed be
the government of the thirty crores of people of India. If all of them
do not receive a fair deal, that will not constitute swaraj at all.
Therefore the Vidyapith thought that the job would be only half done
if they did not serve the backward classes. Dharala Thakore brethren
come to see me. They cannot even sign their names. But I do not care
if they do not know how to sign their names, they should know what is
swaraj.  You ought to know what our duty to the people is, why we
should spin, why we should wear only khadi and why we should not
wear cloth made even by mills in our country. What a sad and
shameful thing it is if you do not know all this! If you do not know
this, how can our administration run? The Dharala Thakores, the
Bhangis and all other communities can participate in our adminis-
tration. It is for this that Shamalbhai is here. You may say that the
Patidars have exploited you to the uttermost limit. Perhaps there may
1 A Scheduled Tribe in GujaratVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           55be some truth in it. There may not be unity between the Patidars and
the Dharala Thakores in all matters. But an organization of youths has
arisen from among the Patidars themselves which has deemed it its
duty to serve you. They believe in serving others first and themselves
afterwards.
You few Dharala Thakore brothers who have come here, please
carry my message to everyone in his home. The  Patidars  and we are
not adversaries. If you have considered them as your enemies, forget
it. The Patidars and the Dharalas are  both  brothers. Only just now I
was introduced to a brother who had presented  yarn to me. He  used
to drink liquor and even offer  it to  others—but he has given it up
and is making others follow suit. Everyone ought  at any rate to give
up liquor and also thiev-ing and looting. Have  you ever seen a thief
becoming a million-aire? None has become a rich man through theft.
And even if anyone has done so, ultimately he has remained a beggar
only. One cannot, like the merchant, become a millionaire through
theft. Nothing is  to  be gained through theft, l ooting, violence, etc.
But if we want to live in t his world  cleanly  and thus present ourselves
at God’s court, take it for certain that our hands, legs, eyes, ears and
hearts ought to be pure. Else we would not be fit to remain in His
court. In order to make all this possible, the Vallabh Vidyalaya has
been established. It is my hope that Shamalbhai will complain to me
that there are so many children of the Patanwadias and Dharala
Thakores that the school is too small to accommodate them. In this
Vidyalaya, those who have no money are going to be fed and clothed.
But none should take wrong advantage of it. It is my desire that those
who have money should study even by paying fees and there will
come a time when I shall have to say that I shall set up as many
schools as you require. You may know that we have a plentiful supply
of teachers and we shall get them from anywhere. We shall teach boys
and by and by even girls. But all that depends on the extent to which
you give encouragement to the Vallabh Vidyalaya.
You have asked for my blessings. Them you certainly have. But
you have them on the condition that you impart lustre to this
Vidyalaya and its name. The Patidars also should benefit by it and
should disgrace neither the Vallabh Vidyalaya nor my name. I do not
care for the sort of Vidyalaya which may prove a millstone round my
neck and be a burden to me. Education liberates us, frees us from
bondage, helps us to shine, adds to the country’s wealth, enriches
character; our boys and girls become smart and intelligent thereby.
This Vidyalaya has been established with this end in view. May this
end be realized. I express gratitude to all those who have given56       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdonations for this Vidyalaya and have offered lime, labour and other
types of help. What we build with our own money will shine forth
better than what we do with money got from the rich men of Bombay.

75. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS
BORSAD,
May 6, 1931
Interviewed by the Associated Press correspondent regarding the resolution
passed by the Manchester Royal Exchange, Mahatma Gandhi said :
The resolution of the Manchester Royal Exchange is partly
based on misapprehension. There  is no  hostility  towards  Britain in
the  present movement but, on the countrary, the Congressmen are
trying against heavy odds to promote goodwill as far as it is possible
under the present circumstances. It is not sufficiently realized what
trem-endous step the Congress had taken in lifting boycott of British
goods.
The boycott of foreign cloth should not be mixed up with
British goods. It is a misnomer to call boycott of foreign cloth as
boycott. That name therefore has been intentionally omitted from the
Delhi Settlement. I use the word boycott even for the exclusion of
foreign cloth because it has become a current popular expression.
Nobody, however, mistakes its purpose. The exclusion of foreign
cloth does produce political conse-quences but it is a predominantly
economic and social proposition and an economic necessity for the
semi-starved millions. Instead therefore of agitating against the
permanent movement of economic uplift, if the leading men in Lan-
cashire will find out ways and means of disposing of their manu-
factures in other countries where they are wanted, they will save much
time and really promote goodwill between the two countries.
I regard the attempt to suppress peaceful picketing as fruitless.
Surely Lord Irwin did not accept peaceful picketing of foreign cloth
and liquor shops without sound reasons and anyone who studies this
question as patiently as he did cannot but come to the same conclu-
sion as Lord Irwin.
The Hindustan Times , 8-5-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           5776. NOTES
SOLD LANDS1
To sell a farmer’s land and that for a song is vivisection. The
sale of forfeited lands in Gujarat was such an operation. The clause in  
the Settlement about these lands was for Sardar Vallabhbhai the 
biggest bite to swallow. But he swallowed it because ultimately he
shared my faith that the lands could not long be withheld by the  
buyers from the original owners and in any case they were bound to   
be restored when the full settlement was attained. It must be said to the
credit of the buyers that they are one by one realizing the necessity of
restoring the lands they made the mistake of buying. The reader
already knows how through the kind intervention of Sir Cowasji
Jehangir, Syts. Nariman, Vimadalal and Modi, Sardar Garda has
agreed to restore to the original holders the lands bought by him in
Bardoli Taluka and how Syt. Cowasji of Kukadbeda and Thakur
Khumansing of BORSAD have returned lands bought by them without
asking for a refund of money paid by them. The latest instances are
those of Sheth Virchand in Bardoli and Thakore of Dehvan in BORSAD.
The Thakore would not think of having even the price paid by him
returned to him. He had paid Rs. 1,200 for nearly 120 acres of good
land. Three poor Dharalas too returned eleven acres which they had
bought for Rs. 48 stating in their letter addressed to me that they were
sorry that being poor they had to ask for the refund of the actual
amount paid by them although they recognized that they should not
ask for it. It reflects credit on all these buyers for their having
patriotically returned the lands. I say patriotically for there was no
pressure save that of silent public opinion brought to bear upon these
buyers. Their friends certainly approached them but there was no
threat or coercion employed by anybody. Healthy public opinion has
an influence of which we have not realized the full significance. But
we are not yet out of the wood. There are yet tough buyers who have
not come forward. But I have little doubt that if the workers don’t lose
patience and the Settlement does not otherwise break down, they will
also respond to the influence of that opinion. Public opinion becomes
intolerable when it becomes violent and aggressive.
I am happy to be able to inform the reader that otherwise too   
the things in Gujarat seem to be moving, though very slowly,  
towards a settlement. How we are implementing the Truce in Gujarat
1 A similar note also appeared in Navajivan , 3-5-1931 58       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIon behalf of the Congress is partly told by Mahadev Desai in his
weekly letter.1
At this juncture, it is necessary for me to add that it is not
dharma for a satyagrahi to harass anyone. He should wish well even to
those who hate him. Sardar Garda is afraid that the farmers may
harass him.  He was even complaining of harassment. I have told him
that I would look into the matter if he sent me the details of any
specific complaint, and I have also assured him that no satyagrahi will
harass him. I have   no doubt that the farmers will fully honour this
assurance which I have given on their behalf. If we wish to win swaraj
without delay, it is our dharma to live amicably with everyone and win
everyone’s  heart. It should not be forgotten that this includes the
official class as well.
POLICE TYRANNY
A correspondent asks: “Do you advise taking legal proceedings
against the police or other officials for their lawlessness during the
struggle?”
Whilst this is provided for in the Settlement, I cannot advise such
proceedings except where the lawlessness persists in some shape or
other and where it is possible to produce conclusive evidence of the
past lawlessness. But generally speaking, we must, in view of the Settle-
ment try to bury the dead past and hope and work for a lasting
settlement.
IN THE NAME OF ‘CASHMERE ’
Sjt. Kotak of the A. I. S. A., Kashmir, writes:2
People have by now begun to know real khadi from the base imitation.
Fine woollen things come only from Kashmir, and so it has become the
fashion nowadays to palm off foreign woollens as cashmere, i.e., fabrics
hand-spun and hand-woven in Kashmir.
Can you not do anything to stop this fraud?
Let those who go in for fine wollens and silks take note of the
warning. One moral is to trace every article to its source. This can
only be done by confining one’s sales to things manufactured in
one’s own neighbourhood. But this is not always possible. The next
thing therefore is to buy from certified stores or from those whose
managers are personally known to us. Swadeshi dharma like every

therefore mind the trouble of knowing the history of every piece of
cloth and for that matter every article they use. While khadi is both the
centre and the circumstance of swadeshi, there is much else to fill in
the intervening spaces. A person who, using khadi, gives himself or
herself the license to buy everything else foreign does not know the
spirit behind khadi and discredits it.

77. POWER OF AHIMSA 1
A correspondent writes a Gujarati letter of which the following is
a translations2:
If I have anywhere referred to India haivng received the fullest
support from world opinion, it should be set down as an unconscious
exaggeration. I should like to be shown such a statement of mine if I
have made one. For myself I have absolutely no idea of having made
any such statement.
The correspondent, by comparing the condition of unarmed
India pitted against the British military power to that of a defenceless
woman thrown at the tender mercy of a ruffian, has done an injustice
to the strength as well of non-violence as of woman. Had not man in
his blind selfishness crushed woman’s soul as he has done or had she
not succumbed to ‘the enjoyments’ she would have given the world
an exhibition of the infinite strength that is latent in her. What she
showed in the last fight was but a broken and imperfect glimpse of it.
The world shall see it in all its wonder and glory when woman has
secured a equal opportunity for herself with man and fully developed
her powers of mutual aid and combination.
And it is wrong to say that a person is unarmed in the sense of
being weak who has ahimsa as his weapon. The correspondent is
evidently a stranger to the real use or the immeasurable power of
ahimsa. He has used it, if at all, only mechanically and as an
expedience for want of a better. Had he been saturated with the spirit
of ahimsa, he would have known that it can tame the wildest beast,
certainly the wildest man.
If, therefore, the world’s blood did not boil over the brutalities   
1 A similar article also appeared in Navajivan, 3-5-1931 under the heading
“Why Did Not Their Blood Boil?”
2 Not reproduced here60       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIof the past year, it was not because the world was brutal or heartless
but because our non-violence, widespread through it was, good  
enough though it was for the purpose intended, was not the non-
violence of the strong and the knowing. It did not spring from a living
faith. It was but a policy, a temporary expedient. Though we did not
retaliate, we had harboured anger, our speech was not free from
violence, our thoughts still less so. We generally refrained from violent
action, because we were under discipline. The world marvelled even at
this limited exhibition of non-violence and gave us, without any
propaganda, the support and sympathy that we deserved and needed.
The rest is a matter of the rule of three. If we had the support that we
received for the limited and mechanical non-violence we were able to
practise during the recent struggle, how much more support should we
command when we have risen to the full height of ahimsa? Then the
world’s blood will certainly boil. I know we are still far away from
that divine event. We realized our weakness at Cawnpore, Benares,
Mirzapur. When we are saturated with ahimsa we shall not be non-
violent in our fight with the bureaucracy and violent among ourselves.
When we have a living faith in non-violence, it will grow from day to
day till it fills the whole world. It will be the mightiest propaganda that
the world will have witnessed. I live in the belief that we will realize
that vital ahimsa.

78. DANGERS OF  DEMOCRACY1
There is no human institution but has its dangers. The greater
the institution the greater the chances of abuse. Democracy is a great
institution and therefore it is liable to be greatly abused. The remedy
therefore is not avoidance of democracy but reduction of possibility
of abuse to a minimum.
The Congress has become a vast democratic body. It reached a
high water-mark during the past twelve months. Without being
technically on the register millions took possession of it and added
lustre to it. But goondaism also entered the Congress to a much larger
extent than hitherto. It was inevitable. The ordinary rules prescribed
for the selection of volunteers were practically set aside during the last
1 Navajivan,  3-5-1931; also published an article on the same subject, under the
title “A House Divided Cannot Stand”.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           61stage of the struggle. The result has been that in some places goon-
daism has made itself felt. Some Congressmen have even been
threatened with disaster if they will not give the money demanded of
them. Of course, professional goondas may also take advantage of the
atmosphere and ply their trade.
The wonder is that the cases I have in mind are so very few
compared to what they might have been, regard being had to the
great  mass awakening. My conviction  is  that t his  happy state is due
to the Congress creed of non-violence, even though we have but
crudely followed it. But there has been sufficient expression of goon-
daism to warn us to take time by the forelock and adopt preventive
and precautionary measures.
The measures that suggest themselves to me are naturally and
certainly a scientific and more intelligent and disciplined application
of non-violence. In the first place if we had a firmer faith in non-
violence than we have shown not one man or woman who did not
strictly conform to the rules regarding the admission of volunteers
would have been taken. It would be no answer to say that in that case
there would have been no volunteers during the final stage and
therefore there would have been a perfect failure. My experience
teaches me to the contrary. It is possible to fight a non-violent battle
even with one satyagrahi. But it, i.e., a non-violent battle, cannot be
fought with a million non-satyagrahis. And I would welcome even an
utter failure with non-violence unimpaired rather than depart from it
by a hair’s breadth to achieve a doubtful success. Without adopting a
non-compromising attitude so far as non-violence is concerened, I can
see nothing but disaster in the end. For, at the critical moment we may
be found wanting, weighed in the scales of non-violence, and may be
found hopelessly unprepared to meet the forces of disorder that might
suddenly be arrayed against us.
But having made the mistake of indiscriminate recruiting how
are we to repair the mischief in a non-violent way? Non-violence
means courage of the highest order and therefore readiness to suffer.
There should therefore be no yielding to bullying, bluff or worse,
even though it may mean the loss of a few precious lives. Writers of
threatening letters should be made to realize that their threats will not
be listened to. But at the same time their disease must be diagnosed
and properly treated. Even the goondas are part of us and therefore
they must be handled gently and sympathetically. People generally do
not take to goondaism for the love of it. It is a symptom of a deeper-62       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIseated disease in the body politic. The same law should govern our
relations with internal goondaism that we apply in our relations with
the goondaism in the system of government. And if we have felt that
we have the ability to deal with that highly organized goodaism in a
non-violent manner, how much more should we feel the ability to deal
with internal goondaism by the same method?
It follows that we may not seek police assistance to deal with   
the disease although it is open, during the Truce, to any Congress-  
man to  seek it precisely in  the  same manner as any  other citizen.
The way I have suggested is the way of reform, conversion, love.
Seeking police assistance is the way of punishment, fear, want of
affection if not actual disaffection. The two methods therefore cannot
run together. The way of reform appears at some stage or other to be
difficult but it is in reality the easiest.

79. FOR ‘FOLLOWERS’
A friend sends me the following:
It will be very helpful if you will kindly guide your followers about their
conduct when they to engage in a political controversy. Your guidance on the
following points is particularly needed:
(a)Vilification so as to lower the opponent in public estimation.
(b)Kind of criticism of the opponent permissible.
(c)Limit to which hostility should be carried.
(d)Whether effort should be made to gain office and power.
I have said before in these pages that I claim no followers. It is
enough for me to be my own follower. It is by itself a sufficiently
taxing performance. But I know that many claim to be my followers. I
must therefore answer the questions for their sakes. If they will follow
what I endeavour to stand for rather than me they will see that the
following answers are derived from truth and ahimsa.
(a)Vilification of an opponent there can never be. But this does
not exclude a truthful characterization of his acts. An opponent is not
always a bad man because he opposes. He may be as honourable as
we may claim to be and yet there may be vital differences between
him and us.
(b)Our criticism will therefore be if we believe him to be guilty
of untruth to meet it with truth, of discourtesy with courtesy, of bully-
ing with calm courage, of violence with suffering, of arrogance withVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           63humility, of evil with good. ‘My follower’ would see not to condemn
but to convert.
(c)There is no question of any limit to which hostility may be
carried. For there should be no hostility to persons. Hostility there
must be to acts when they are subversive of morals or the good of
society.
(d)Office and power must be avoided. Either may be accepted
when it is clearly for greater service.

80. FOREIGN MISSIONARIES AGAIN
DEAR MAHATMA,
. . . A friend of mine gave me a copy of the Madras Catholic Leader of the
26th March, and it is there that you are reported to have given expression to
the . . . remarks. . . . “ Every nation’s religion is as good as any other. Certainly
India’s religions are adepuate for her people. We need no converting
spiritually .”
I am a Christian, but I certainly am against Christianity being brought as
an instrument of Imperialism. But as a message of love and fellowship, who
will deny it a place in Indian life? In this great struggle for swaraj, are we not
fighting for liberty, liberty to worship our God as we please, liberty to
convince our fellows who are willing to be convinced by us, liberty to be
convinced by our fellows who can convince us? . . . Is India so bigoted as to
think that within her are confined all the riches of the world, all the treasures
of knowledge and human experience? . . .
Religion, I deem, is a matter between an individual and his own
conception of right conduct. Religion belongs to the great realm of thought
and personal experience which knows neither boundaries nor nations. . . . But
I would like to know, if you made those remarks, what you meant by them, or I
confess they are a mystery to me.
ST. XAVIER’S I remain,

I do not know that in reply to this letter1 I need do more than
refer the writer to my article in Young India .2 It might be as well to
add that in mentioning Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, etc., as
India’s religi-ons, I had no desire to claim them as India’s exclusively
1 Of which only excerpts have been reproduced here.
2 Vide “Foreign Missionaries”, 23-4-193164       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIor to exclude Christianity. The issue was Christianity on the one hand
claimed as the one true religion and other religions on the other being
regarded as false. In joining issue I contended that the great world
religions other than Christianity professed in India were no less true
than Christianity. It was thus neither relevant nor necessary for me to
assert before Christian missionaries and their protagonists that
Christianity was true. Moreover, with my known partiality for the
Sermon on the Mount and my repeated declarations that its author
was one of the greatest among the teachers of mankind I could not
suspect that there would be any charge against me of underrating
Christianity. As for Christian, Indians, I count among them many
warm friends and I have had no difficulty whatsoever in establishing
friendly touch with the Christian masses wherever I have gone. Nor is
there any fear of my estranging even the foreign missionaries among
whom I claim many personal friends. The attack against me has
therefore surprised me not a little especially because the views I have
now enunciated have been held by me since 1916, and were
deliberately expressed in a carefully written address read before a
purely missionary audience in Madras and since repeated on many a
Christian platform. The recent criticism has but confirmed the view,
for the criticism has betrayed intolerance even of friendly criticism.
The missionaries know that in spite of my outspoken criticism of their
methods, they have in India and among non-christians no warmer
friend than I. And I suggest to my critics that there must be something
wrong about their method or, if they prefer, themselves when they will
not brook sincere expression of an opinion different from theirs. In
India under swaraj I have no doubt that foreign missionaries will be at
liberty to do their proselytizing, as I would say, in the wrong way; but
they would be expected to bear with those who, like me, may point out
that in their opinion the way is wrong.

82. LETTER TO R. M. MAXWELL
[AS AT] SABARMATI ,
May 7, 1931
DEAR MR. MAXWELL,
I thank you for your letter of the 4th instant. I shall await your
further letter. May I however remind you that your receipt of a copy
of the revised notice referred to in your letter will only enable His
Excellency to deal with one matter whereas my original letter2 covers
several matters out of which unlicensed liquor selling is becoming
more and more urgent daily because it seems to be increasing. His
Excellency will perhaps agree that this is a manifest breach of the
Settlement.
There is one other matter which I wish to add. There is the

2 Vide “Letter to R. M. Maxwell”, 22-4-193166       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIYoung India  press1 still undelivered. The district officer suggests that
the Manager should himself remove the press from where it is lying, I
believe, in Bombay and a portion in Ahmedabad. The district officer
in Kaira suggests a like procedure for a motor and a bicycle lying
somewhere in Kaira. Cl. 16(a) of the Settlement clearly contemplates
the return of movable property seized in connection with the
movement. It does not say that the seized property is to be taken on
application by the person but it is to be returned, and if it is not
irrelevant to mention it here, I may inform you that the word
‘returned’ was chosen after discussion. I may also add that, whilst I do
not know anything about  the condition of the Young India  press and
other seized property, I do know that the motor-car, and the bicycle
seized in Kaira are admittedly in a broken-up condition. It is also
common ground that, when they were seized, they were in good order
and condition. The district officer in Kaira in reply to my letter in
connection with these articles says as follows in his letter :
Reference the delivery of a motor-car and cycle. Government have issued
orders that ordinarily the owner of property attached under the ordinance
should be asked to remove the property from the place where it is and that
Government cannot undertake to undergo expenditure in restoring it. I have no
funds to which I could debit the cost of towing the car—I understand it is not in
running order—to Nadiad. I shall be in Kaira tomorrow morning and suggest
that the owner should have it removed from my office there. If he thinks he has
a right to recover from Government the cost of removal and reconditioning, he
should send in his bill to Government and no doubt Government will call for a
full report on the whole circumstances, and the matter can be thrashed out, but
at present there is a which statemate results in the car still suffering
depreciatin.
I venture to suggest that these articles should be returned in the
same condition in which they were at the time of seizure. I do not
know that the officials of the Government had any authority or right
to use these articles. But even if they had and if they broke them, at
the time of return they should be in good order and condition. I
would like the Government to give these two matters prompt attention.

 [AS AT] SABARMATI ,
May 7, 1931
DEAR FRIEND,
I have your letter. In order to enable me to give a decisive
opinion I should certainly like to have Shankar Rao’s version also.
But subject to that reservation I have no hesitation in agreeing with
you that all parties should be represented on Congress Committees by
agreement or there should be an open honest election without any
1 In his reply dated May 13, Maxwell stated : “You have suggested that the
word “returned” in clause 16(a) of the Agreement should be interpreted to mean “taken
back to the place where the property was seized”. In the absence, however, of any
such explana-tion in the terms of the Settlement itself, the Government are unable to
attach to the word in question any but its ordinary meaning, viz., “given back”, and,
while they are ready  at any time to carry out the agreement in this sense, they do not
feel justified in throwing On the taxpayers the expense of transporting the articles
from the places where they now are. I am to say that your further contention that the
Government are responsible for delivering such articles in the same condition in
which they were seized, does not appear to be warranted by anything in the terms of
the Settlement. On the contrary clause 16(c) of the Settlement expressly says that
“compensation will not be given for deterioration”. I am to add that under section
4(3) of Ordinance IX of 1930 even property seized but not forfeited may be used in
such manner as the Magistrate may direct. The motor-car and cycle now in question
were, however, actually forfeited and had they been sold or destroyed, the original
owners would have had no further claim to them, since clause 16(a) of the Settlement
agrees to the return of seized moveable property only if it is still in the possession of
Government. I am therefore to express the hope that you will now make arrangements
to take delivery of these forfeited articles without more delay, since it will not be
possible for Government to be responsible for their custody indefinitely if those
interested do not choose to avail themselves of clause 16(a) of the Settlement.

If you are really free from any animal passion, you have a right

appetites, seeing that there has been no consummation of marriage,
she should be free to rgard the present marriage as no marriage at all

make her way smooth and easy. I am satisfied that in no case are you

distorting the real condition. The Delhi Agreement  tabooed threats,
intimidation and coercion of every form in connection with picketing

intact for thousands of years, but the body never lasts for more than a

brother may have passed away, but the soul which dwelt in his body
has not perished. It had no brother, or rather all were its brothers.
When, therefore, there are deaths among relations, instead of letting
ourselves be swayed by ignorance we should cultivate greater capacity
for endurance, greater disinterestedness towards the world and greater
knowledge . . .1 (This death has no connection whatever with the fact
of Kaku having strayed from the path of dharma. Do not remind
Kaku of what he did). Let Kaku remain there now and work and earn.
He may take up voluntary work if and when he feels inclined to do so.
I shall leave for Simla on Monday. Come and see me before
that. I see no need for you to go to Bombay, but you may certainly
go if you cannot restrain yourself.

92. LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU
CAMP BORSAD,
May 8, 1931
MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
I had your telegram and now I have your letter of 30th ultimo
but not the previous letter. There is certainly no urgent need about
your returning. From your telegram I have gathered that you were all
A1 in spite of the chill of which you write to me in your letter. What
you read in the papers about a break-down was not without
foundation but just now in Gujarat there is no immediate danger of a
breakdown. I am going to Simla next week to confer with Mr. Eme-
rson about several outstanding matters and he says in his letter that
incidentally there would be meeting with the Government about the
Round Table Conference. He expects me also to go to Nainital on or
about the 18th. I do not know how things are progressing in the U.P.
just now. But it will be as well for me to go to Nainital. Of course you
were quite right in writing to me on the Hindu-Muslim question as
1 Omission as in the sourceVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           73frankly as you have done. I should have felt hurt if you had done less.
You have a perfect right to unburden yourself without the least fear of
being misunderstood by me. Of course I do not plead guilty to your
charge. I have always taken good care to say that I was speaking for
myself. So long as we have not evolved a concrete policy how could I
help expressing my own personal views? But the occasions have not
been many when I have let myself go. I quite agree with you that Dr.
Ansari’s proposal about arbitration consisting of the many names he
suggests is highly unpractical. Nothing of course has come out of it.
Dr. Mahmud’s fear is absolutely baseless. I did see Bhopal at the
latter’s instance and when he discussed the Hindu-Muslim question I
naturally said that he might call in Shaukat Ali and his other friends
and then summon me to Bhopal if he thought that there was anything
to be done. I could not say to him that he was not to move at all. That
same day Mrs. Naidu brought Shaukat Ali to Mani Bhuvan and I
related the conversation I had with Bhopal. Nothing more has
happened. I have made no movement and have written not one single
line beyond saying that I was praying, which I am literally doing. I
wrote last week as much to Dr. Mahmud1 when he complained that I
had broken the pact that I was to be dumb. When you return
completely restored, we must have a meeting of the Working
Committee and if we can evolve a formula for the guidance of all
Congressmen, nothing will please me more. Personally I think that we
shall not be able to evolve any formula just now and I am more and
more driven to the idea I adumbrated before you on the day of your
departure or the day previous. When you reach Bombay of course
you will first of all seek me out wherever I am. It is highly likely that I
shall be by that time in BORSAD or Bardoli.
No going to London without Hindu-Muslim unity.
Love to you all.

SABARMATI ,
[AS AT] May 8, 1931
DEAR FRIEND,
I thank you for your letter of the 24th April. The matter you
refer to is very delicate. There is a romance around the life of Bhagat
Singh. He was no coward. From all enquiries made by me I find that
he was a man of spotless character and of great daring. He exercised
also great influence on some young men. Somehow or other he had
developed a belief that political assassination had its use. It was
impossible not to notice the execution, I believe quite unwise, of
Bhagat Singh and his comrades, whom the execution made martyrs. I
have no doubt whatsoever that the execution has surrounded these
lives with a halo which they would not otherwise have had. The only
thing therefore that was possible and that the Congress was bound to
do was to pass a resolution1 condemning murderous deeds as also the
execution and at the same time appreciating the bravery and sacrifice
underlying such deeds. I however quite agree with you that there is
undoubtedly a great deal of thoughtless approval of political murder.
But many of us are doing everything we can to counteract the growth
of the violent revolutionary movement. Whilst it is being held under
check, I fear that the spirit that is at times breaking out in violence will
not altogether die till India comes to her own. I am not publishing
your letter because the end both you and I have in view is not likely to
be served thereby.
Yours sincerely,

I got your two letters.
I felt a weight off my mind to know that you approved of my
suggestion regarding Lakshmi. Kaka and Vallabhbhai are also of the
same opinion as yours. I have yet to hear from Vinoba and Kishor-
elal. I was not at all pleased by Dwarkanath’s bill. I have kept it back
and written to him strongly about it. I will let you know after I hear
from him. You need, therefore do nothing about it for the present.
The general suggestion you have made concerning such bills does not
require to be acted upon immediately.
I understand what you say about Shankarbhai. I wholly agree
with your decision. Don’t mind what Bhagwanji thinks about it. You
will have to pay Rs. 35 to that Punjabi vaid1. All of them charge their
fees in this way. If all the patients improve, the fee charged by him
will not seem excessive. All the same, we should know on what basis
he charges his fee.You, therefore, did right in writing to Chandra-
shankar about it. Don’t put too many persons under his treatment at a
time. Watch how he treats each case and then proceed further. I shall
be leaving for Simla on Monday. No address is necessary for writing
to me there. I have replied to Pragji. Rukhi2 and Benarsi3 have arrived.

cloth is for the sake of khadi. Had the boycott not had the purpose of
serving the poor, at least I would not have been as absorbed in it as I
am now.
Some friends from Karnatak are possessed with the idea that
Karnatak should form a separate province. Why do they worry ? The
Congress has already formed a province of Kannada-speaking people,
it will come into being when we have purna swaraj.

104. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS
BORSAD,
May 8, 1931
Regarding the report published in a Bombay paper about the refusal by Sardar
Garda to return the confiscated lands purchased by him in Bardoli Taluk, Mr. Gandhi,
interviewed, said that the report was correct, but added that so far as he knew there was
no obstruction deliberate or otherwise on the part of men who had strict instructions
not to interfere with those who might be removing crops from the fields in question.
He had undertaken to enquire into every complaint that might be made by Sardar
Garda. He   had asked for specific instances and not one was supplied to him. He was
therefore pain-  ed and surprised at Sardar Garda’s attempt to evade or repudiate the
agreement which after full deliberation he had entered into. Mr. Gandhi had at ready
brought the matter to the notice of Sir Cowasji Jehangir1 who was the principal
negotiator.
Asked whether Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had asked the people of Bardoli Taluk
not to pay unauthorized arrears, Mr. Gandhi said it was not a question of Mr.
Vallabhbhai Patel asking people not to pay arrears. It was a question of inability on
the part of people to pay. The fact was it was really difficult to pay even the current
year’s dues in many cases. In affected areas of both Surat and Kaira districts, they were
obliged to ask for suspension even in some cases in respect of current year’s dues.
The chief thing to aim at was not insisting on pound of flesh but to see that the
political movement for non-payment of taxes was discontinued in a bona-fide
manner and people paid whatever they could under the circumstances.

Can you say positively that cod-liver oil has benefited Sharda

doctors praise cod-liver oil with great enthusiasm, though I have not
come across much evidence of its value.
You should send for Annapurna when you can summon
courage to do so. Remain in contact with her through letters. The only
fear can be lest she should turn out to be a bad type. Even if you have
such fear, you should not be guided by it provided you can get proof
that at present she is all right. That way, there is risk in all things.
According to Bhartrihari, the only state in which one can live free
from fear is that of non-attachment. True non-attachment is that
taught in the Gita, and it  is cultivated by giving up interest in the
fruits of action. In the present case too, if your duty lies in letting her
come and in discarding all  fear about the result of such a course, you
should shed that fear and do  the duty.

108. THE PROBLEM OF FOUR LAKH DHARALAS
With this heading, someone has written the following letter1
under the pseudonym, “A Dharala” :
This letter certainly is full of bitterness, even after I have cut  
out certain sentences which were very venomous. The handwriting   is
very well formed and the language is very sophisticated. Hence    I
guess that it has not been written by a Dharala Thakore but   by a
person who has an animus against Patidars. Be that as it may, the letter
calls for some clarification.
DHARALA THAKORES2
Although the letter has a good deal of venom towards the
Patidars, nevertheless there is some truth in the complaints listed in it.
The failing which is found all over India is also there among the
Patidars, viz., those who are more knowledgeable and richer enjoy a
superior status and misuse it vis-a-vis those who are ignorant and
poor. The feeling of superiority and inferiority is certainly involved in
this. The greatest barrier to our progress, to our attainment of swaraj,
is the fact that those who are better off do not become the protectors
of those who are not so well placed. However, having admitted this
with regard to the Patidars, I must say that there is much exaggeration
in this letter. Some years ago, about fifty thousand Dharalas had
assembled in Vadtal and the Patidars had helped this effort. It was
these who since then made the Dharalas known as Thakores. Today at
all places in Gujarat the Patidar youths are destroying the idea of
superiority and inferiority and many aged Patidars are helping them
in it. Young Patidars are engaged in many kinds of service. They do
not recognize any distinctions between Patidars and others. Their field
of action is as wide as India.
1  Not translated here
2  The source consistently has “Thakars”, which is evidently a misprint.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           83SHRI RAVISHANKAR ’S SERVICES
The correspondent had to admit that Shri Vithalbhai,
Durbarsaheb Gopaldas, Shri Dadubhai and others looked upon the
Dharala Thakores with a feeling of equality. Even a little child knows
that to the Sardar all are equal. He wishes to serve all who are poor,
whether they happen to be Brahmins or Bhangis, Gujaratis or
Madrasis, and it is because the people have recognized this virtue in
him that he has been made the Congress President. This corres-
pondent regards Shri Ravishankar’s services as nominal. I do not
know who renders true service if this very incarnation of sacrifice
renders merely nominal service!
VALLABH VIDYALAYA
Although the above has been founded, I admit that much  still
remains to be done for the Dharala Thakores and such other
communities. However, as the spirit of service grows, the unity 
among the various communities will become greater day by day. 
The school whose foundation stone was only recently laid in  
Bochasan1 and which has been named as Vallabh Vidyalaya—this too
is for the sake of the Dharala Thakores.
Hence I would request the above correspondent not to add to  
mutual bitterness but rather seek and suggest ways which would
promote friendliness among all. From the manner in which he wields
his pen, it seems that he has the ability to do so. I invite him to put it
to good use.
PATIDARS
A few words to the Patidars. They should look deep within
themselves and rid themselves of any impurity which may be there.
They have shown great courage and sacrificed much. They should
find out any failings which they may still have and get rid of them.

109. NOTES
HYPOCRISY DURING ELECTIONS
Only a handful voted at the elections to the Provincial
Committee held in Bulsar. The elections had to be held because there
1 Vide “Speech at Bochasan”, 6-5-193184       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwere factions. Voters have to be habitual wearers of khadi. Now a
friend writes thus about the kind of khadi-wearers these voters were :1
How great is the disrespect towards the Congress if after a year’s
fierce struggle and after knowing how important a place khadi
occupies in the boycott of foreign cloth, and ordinary rule of the
Congress is violated in this manner! How will these members of the
Congress fare during a crisis? Such hypocrisy sullies the fair name of
the Congress. How are the elections so important that voters have to
pretend that they abide by this rule? And however important they may
be, how can work of any value be done throught the practice of
untruth?
It is likely that at other places in Gujarat also and in the    whole
country, wherever there are many candidates and keen rivalry, similar
practices may have been resorted to. If there are   such laxity and such
hypocrisy in regard to the reputation of the Congress, it can be
guessed with the help of the three how much this will increase on
attainment of swaraj. In the elections following swaraj, there will be
greater temptations because money will be involved then. I believe
that such conduct is shameful and harmful for us. It will benefit
neither us nor the country.
If we are averse to wearing khadi, if we do not believe in the
necessity of khadi, why should we not start a movement for getting the
clause regarding khadi deleted from the Congress regulations ? If the
khadi clause remains, we should abide by it. It that clause meets with
disapproval or if many members of the Congress are not willing to
respect it, they should try to get it removed through an agitation.
KHADI AND THE DESH SEVIKA SANGH OF NADIAD
Shrimati Kashibehn and Shrimati Gangabehn have written the
following to the Taluka Committee on behalf of the Nadiad Desh
Sevika Sangh.2
Whatever injustice has been done to the women of Nadiad
through my article should be removed. Along with it, let me draw
their attention to one matter. The correspondents say in their letter
that fifteen women have been using pure khadi in the past and still
continue to do so while working for the Congress. If this is the case,
1  The letter is not translated here. It had described how voters wore borrowed
khadi clothes at the time of elections.
2 The letter is not translated here. It denied the accusation in Gandhiji’s note
on “Women Volunteers and Khadi”, 26-4-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                           85how many women wear khadi regularly? For those who believe in
khadi, it is not a dress to be worn only on certain occasions—not a
uniform, but something which should be habitually worn. Swaraj
cannot be secured or the poverty of the starving masses cannot be
removed by a few persons wearing khadi on certain occasions. That
can be achieved only when khadi takes root in every home. Hence I
hope that not only Nadiad but also all other towns will take to wearing
khadi exclusively.
TWENTY-FOUR CAPS AND THREE SHIRTS
What would we say of a man who believes that crores of Indians
are starving and half-naked and who at the same time somehow puts
on twenty-four caps on his head and three shirts, one on top of the
other? Should we not say that, although he is compassionate, his
kindness is misguided?
Despite this, we come across many such persons. On reading this
sentence, hasty persons will burst out laughing and some will think me
a fool. However, there is no reason either to laugh or to think me
stupid.
Let us consider the Kathiawari dress.  It consists of a dhoti, a
long shirt,  a short shirt and a turban. In view of the climate there, so
many clothes are not at all needed.Two short shirts can easily be made
out of a single long shirt.  Twenty-four caps can easily be made out of
a twelve yard turban.  Hence it cannot be regarded as an exaggeration
but is rather the bare truth to say that such a person is wearing twenty-
four caps and three shirts. Those reasonable Kathiawaris who under-
stand this straightforward matter and who are kind-hearted will
suggest a remedy for my perplexity.
This question is not  directed towards politicians. They will
defeat me with many arguments, namely, that they have to attend at
the ruler’s court, etc.  Neither is this question meant for employees of
the agencies. Like Drona and Bhishma, they will point to their
stomachs and may even go so far as to sing the lines of Shamal1 :
Stomach it is that makes us slaves
Who dance to the tune the piper plays.
This question is addressed to those who are free of such bond-

1 A seventeenth-eighteenth-century Gujarati poet86        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIMARRIAGE  CONDITIONS
The common custom in regard to marriage in the Anavil
community is that the bride’s father has to pay a handsome sum to
the birdegroom’s father. In the Bardoli swaraj Ashram, there is a
gentleman named Shri Dayalji Gulabbhai who lives under the care of
Shri Lakshmidas. He had married once and had lost his wife. That was
some time ago and he has no children. He thought of marrying again.
He felt, however, that he should not marry during struggle. When the
Settlement came about, he was inclined to yield to desire. A father was
prepared to marry his daughter to Shri Dayalji by paying him a sum
of Rs. 800. He may have been momentarily tempted, but was later
able to overcome the temptation. He will now marry a seventeen-year
old girl named Shantabehn. As the conditions on which this marriage
is to take place are both worth knowing and worth copying, I give
them below :
The dowry will be accepted in the form of yarn instead of cash. And that
yarn weighing eight and a quarter pounds should be spun exclusively by
members of the family.
Not more than twenty-five persons in all consisting of fifteen persons
from the bride’s side and ten from the bridegroom’s side (including men,
women and children) should be invited and all of them must be clad in khadi.
Everyone should eat food cooked in a common kitchen and the meal
should consist only of dal, rice and vegetables. As it is summer, there would be
no harm in taking buttermilk. They would stop the custom of offering ghee to
Brahmins.
Whereas no gifts in the form of cash from relations or as dowry will be
accepted, giving of religious books will be permitted.
After the marriage takes place, those present will be allowed to take
fruits or sherbet instead of betel-leaves and areca-nuts. Tea will not be served
at all.
By way of dowry, only such things as a spinning-wheel, carding-bow,
takli, or carpet or something to sit upon should be given.
Such edible items as sweet balls and puris or any such articles of food
should not be accepted in any form.
At the wedding ceremony, the bride and the bridegroom will wear
garments made of yarn spun with their own hands. No clothes will be bought
for this purpose. Likewise, if anyone wishes to make a present, he would be
permitted to give only yarn spun by him.
At the time of the wedding, the bride will wear no ornament other than a
single piece of each item symbolizing her state of married happiness. Later,
she may accept anything, which anyone wishes to give.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 87
                                   The interval between arrival and departure for the wedding will be three
days during which the ceremony will be performed.
Bangles made of hand-spun yarn should replace those made of gold.
The marriage ceremony will be in accordance with Ashram practice.
Gandhiji’s articles on the shastrik rites regarding marriage vows and his
speeches will be read out. The officiating priest too will be clad in pure khadi
and will accept no fee.
No band will be played and, while devotional songs may be sung, no
vulgar wedding songs will be allowed.
Shri Dayalji and the bride’s father are signatories to this. The
wedding will take place on the 13th. Even ordinary marriages  in the
Anavil community involve large expenses, hence it is no small matter
that in this marriage only the religious ceremony has found a place
and khadi is compulsory for the bride and the groom as well as for
the guests present to bless the couple and the priest. Dhardhaman
implies dowry. The bride’s father provides all household articles by
way of dowry; whereas in this marriage only the implements needed
for spinning may be given, if so desired. Let us hope that this example
will be copied and such marriages will become a common practice
among all communities and that the couples, united under such
auspicious circumstances, will turn out to be true servants of the
country.

110. KHADI IN KAIRA
Shri Gopaldas Purushottam Desai sends the following account
of khadi activity in Patlad—Nadiad:1
Some corrections are required in the above note and figures.
Where information has to be given regarding the actual state of affairs
and where the figures are not beyond our capacity to get, no
conjectures should be made. No meaning can be deduced from the
sentence, “about 50 to 75 spinning-wheels are being plied”. The
number may be below 50 or it may exceed 75. It is likely that the
figure is actually below 50. Hence where the number can be easily
counted, the exact figure should be given and neither one more nor
1 The letters are not translated here.88        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIone less. Moreover, the various qualities of khadi produced in
Patlad—Nadiad should be mentioned as also the count of the yarn.
Mention should also be made of how much khadi has been received
from other places. There should be a comparative statement of figures
showing yarn spun for a living and that spun for becoming self-
sufficient. Amongst the latter kind of spinners, there should be a
break-up of the number of men and women. How much yarn thay
spin on an average should be indicated. Do they spin only for
themselves or for others as well? Alongside the statement that the
workers numbered 151, how much they had earned should also have
been mentioned. There should be sub-divisions even amongst them.
All this accounting without details cannot be regarded as scientific and
no conclusions can be drawn therefrom.
 With regard to the above figures, it may be noted that the
figures for Petlad and Nadiad are given separately. It may be said in
general that the figures for Nadiad are about half of those for petlad.
It is for Nadiad to say why this is so.
Let me now turn to Limbasi. Shri Vithaldas writes from there as
follows:1
Along with this, the names of those in whose homes the
spinning-wheel is being plied have been mentioned. In regard to this
report also, the above criticism should be regarded as applicable to the
extent it is relevant. The reference to a dearth of spinning-wheels
should put us to shame. At every place, we should develop the capa-
city to make spinning wheels. One or two samples should be obtained
from Bardoli and spinning-wheels should be made everywhere.
Moreover, this recommendation is far more applicable to places where
inmates of the Ashram happen to be living. What kind of wood should
be used for making spinning-wheels and other information should be
obtained from Bardoli. All should remember that the workshop there
is not meant for earning money but is a training centre. Hence
everyone can get the necessary information from there. A time will
come when people will demand spinning-wheels and taklis in every
home. If even then we continue to depend on Bardoli, Satyagraha
Ashram and such other places, our work will certainly come to a
stand-still. Even the largest single factory cannot provide crors of
spinning-wheels. This is neither necessary nor desirable. The meaning
of the khadi movement and its special feature is that every process
1 The letters are not translated here.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 89
                                   involved in its production can be carried out in every village. Khadi is
not an enterprise that supports a single activity, but it feeds many
activities. Hence every one of its limbs should blossom forth in every
village.

May 10, 1931
CHI. SHANTA,
I got your letter. The fact that you find the rules and the work
there too much for you shows that, when you were living outside, you
did not lead a disciplined life. Your desire to remain like a child is
certainly good, but being like a child does not mean remaining lazy, it
means being innocent and pure in mind. You are certainly not pure in
mind. Are you innocent? If you are not, you should strive to be. It is a
dangerous thing that you like very much to mix with boys, and not
with girls. This will some day bring about your fall. Have a look at the
world around. If all the girls wished to live as you wish no girl would
have the company of another girl. Do you think you can jump about
and play with boys as freely as you can with girls? It is dangerous for
you to wish to cross the bar which God has created. Think over this
and try to understand it. Show this letter to Premabehn and discuss it
with her, and then reply to me. Obey her and help her in her work.
Your letters will not be read by anyone by whom you do not
wish them to be read. Anandi will not accompany me. She is still at
Bardoli.

Nobody has prompted me regarding your going to Simla. When
I was at Ahmedabad the matter was discussed. He had told me that
you would not accompany him but might go subsequently. You have
been constantly in my eyes. So I felt like writing to you and am
writing. I do hope you will go. We may meet there if you come early.
Khurshedbehn should also go there if she can make it.
Nargisbehn has already advocated her case to me. Perinbehn came

May 13, 1931
Asked by the Associated press representative for any ‘story’, Mr. Gandhi
remarked:
You can write about the flowers and garlands that you see in the
car.
At the octroi post, the car stopped for a minute when a letter from Mr.
Emerson, Home Secretary, was handed to Gandhiji.
Gandhiji, interviewed by a representative of the Associated Press of India who
stood on the running board of his car, stated that he had received no invitation from
the Viceroy but from the Home Secretary. He would stay in Simla for two or three
days, possibly longer, and then proceed probably to Nainital.

 118. NOTES
‘A CRY IN THE WILDERNESS ’
I take the following passage with slight changes from a
communication in my file :
Protection of indigenous cloth by exclusion of foreign cloth and foreign
yarn from the country—this is vague and gives room for suspicion. The
starving millions living in the villages cannot be fed by the Indian mills. For
the last four months the demand for khadi has been going down steadily and
that for mill-cloth is increasing. The reason is that Congress organizations
are supporting the Indian mill-manufacture. Gandhiji’s cry of boycott through
khadi is a cry in the wilderness. Therefore the real position of the Congress
with regard to khadi must be made clear.
I have had a similar complaint from other sources too. There is
no doubt that the Congressmen think that because the Congress is
having help from and dealings with mill-owners, Congressmen are
free to use mill-manufactures in the place of khadi or at least to use
either optionally. Such however is certainly not the case. The Con-
gress policy in this matter remains unchanged. The Congress expects
everyone under its influence to use hand-spun and hand-woven khadi
to the exclusion of all other cloth. Any laxity in this observance is not
only bound to harm khadi and therefore the villages but it is also
bound to harm boycott of foreign cloth. It will be found that in the
end the boycott will be possible only through khadi. The success
1 On May 10 and 11. The Nawab of Bhopal had invited the leaders of the All-
India Nationalist Muslim Party and the All-India Muslim Conference to work out an
agreed formula on the question of electorates.94        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhitherto obtained is due to khadi. This is not to say that the
indigenous mills have played no part in the campaign against foreign
cloth. But it is contended that the mills came in when the owners
realized that khadi was doing it, that khadi had shown the way, that
khadi had brought about the psychological change. What is however
the most important to remember is that boycott of foreign cloth will
not be worth the tremendous energy that has been put into it if it was
designed merely to stimulate the dividends of a few hundred thousand
shareholders. It is a national necessity only because through khadi the
crores of money saved through boycott of foreign cloth will be
distributed among the millions of villagers. It is therefore necessary
for men and women belonging to the Congress not to slacken their
effort for khadi.
 RUMOURED AMERICAN VISIT
An American friend says in the course of a letter1 dated 6th
April that
. . . This evening an Associated Press despatch from New Delhi, as given
in the Boston Transcript , reports that ‘Mahatma Gandhi is considering a visit
to the United States, etc,. . . .
The soul of India has greater tasks than can be performed through
physical presence in the United States at this time. . . .
Whether I represent the soul of India or not is a debatable point.
But with reference to the American visit I have felt exactly like my
correspondent. The work in India, if it has any spiritual value, will
affect America and every other country outside India far more than
the physical presence. Indeed when the spirit is free the physical case
often becomes a hindrance rather than a help. The invisible effect of
the spirit free must be a million times greater than that of the spirit
limited by the earthly tabernacle. Much therefore as I should love to
visit America, the voice within warns me against feeding the wish.
Happily other friends like Rev. Holmes, Mr. Kerby page, Dr.
Sherwood Eddy, Dr. Ward sent me a cable2 about the same time the
above letter was posted warning me against the visit. They thought that
I would be exploited without serving the cause at the present juncture.
I feel sure that these friends are right. Those friends therefore who
have been pressing me to go to America would please excuse me till
the time is ripe, if it ever is for me to go to their great country.

                                   Meantime let them dispel, if they will, the ignorance and the misrepre-
sentations that prevail in abundance about Indian affairs in their land.

119. DANGER LOOMING1
The public know little of what took place in Karachi the other  
day. A half-cracked man like me by name Gajadhar Shau from 
Central Provinces but as little known there as in Karachi took it     into
his head that he could establish swaraj in a few days. He collected all
the unemployed and other labourers, promising them two them two
rupees per day and delivered an ultimatum to the merchants and
moneyed men that they should stop export and import business, stop
the manufacture of mill-cloth, collect one crore rupees in a fortnight
and utilize it for giving employment to all who were in need at a level
wage of two rupees per day through the spinning-wheel and the like.
Meetings were held and fierce resolutions were passed. Keys of safes
of were demanded. The indefatigable Mayor of Karachi met the men
and in a lucid moment Sjt. Gajadhar said he would stop his activity if I
disapproved of it. This was good enough for Sjt. Jamshed Mehta and
his friends and Sjt. Gajadhar who by this time had become a Mahatma
came to me as also later Sjts. Sidhwa and Isherdas. I recognized in Sjt.
Gajadhar an old correspondent who always tried my and my co-
workers’ patience by sending long letters and even wires. We became
friends on sight. I had to give him nearly two hours I could scarcely
spare. The upshot of it all was that he promised to stop his activity
though I did not carry conviction to him. Whether he will carry out
his promise remains to be seen. Even if he does not, the workers of
Karachi will be able to deal effectively with any crisis that may arise.
But the incident of Karachi is a portent. If the acts of Con-
gressmen are not firm and absolutely correct, there is every danger of
the Congress and all other healthy activities being swallo-wed up by
the onrushing floods for want of the necessary embank-ment of
discipline. Storms and floods there always will be. But discip-line is to
disorder what bulwarks and embankments are to storms and floods.
The awakening of the masses hitherto drugged into sleep by
ignorance and despotism can easily prove their own undoing together
with a wreckage of the social structure. The attempt of the Congress is
1Vide also “Messagge to Hindustani Seva Dal”, 9-5-193196        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIto reform the social structure, remove abuses and at the same time
help the masses to occupy the position of which they have been long
deprived.
Behind the crazy demand of Sjt. Gajadhar Shau there was a
substratum of truth. Unemployment there undoubtedly was and still is
in Karachi as elsewhere, as throughout the 7,00,000 villages of India.
No society can long endure that harbours or creates an army of
unemployed. There is something wrong in such society. There must
therefore be some occupation always available for those who will
work. The Karachi scheme asked for employment through the
charkha. Unfortunately the author knew no more perhaps about the
charkha than the name. But I do believe that in its extensive meaning
so as to include all the cotton processes from picking to weaving and
washing, colouring and tailoring, it does provide permanent and un-
limited occupation for the city-dwellers as well as the villagers. This
does not exclude other occupations. But this one thing may be
adopted anywhere and everywhere.
One thing we must rigidly guard against and that is free 
kitchens. Free kitchens are a dangerous institution designed to manu-
facture paupers. Public kitchens may be run wherever they are a felt
want. Everyone can work for a meal and be sure of getting a cheap
clean meal in healthy surroundings. It is necessary for us to learn that
it is a sin to give a free meal to one who is fit to do any remunerative
work at all.
Young India, 14-5-1931
120. ‘NO CHANGE OF HEART’
This heading has no reference to change of heart among the
rulers. It refers to absence of change of heart among ourselves
according to the following impeachment1 of a Sindhi correspondent.
I believe that the complaint about foreign cloth is substantially
correct. There is not in the cities at least that real change of taste such
that the people will not touch foreign cloth whether it comes from
England, Japan, France or elsewhere. Though the intellect admits the
desirability of abjuring foreign cloth, the heart yearns after the   
1 Not reproduced here. The correspondent had complained that the old love for
foreign cloth was still alive and blamed Gandhiji for having a soft corner for the mill-
owners. Vide also “Foreign Cloth and Other British Goods”, 23-4-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 97
                                   fineries which only come from foreign countries. Love of self pre-
dominates over love of the country or rather love of the semi-starved
millions.
Picketing of foreign-cloth shops has but a limited use. The real
thing is the education of the masses in these matters. Better even than
education is the example of workers and better still is teaching the
people how to produce cheap khadi through self-spinning. In practice
all the three methods will go together.There must be therefore
imparting to the people a knowledge of the economics of boycott
through khadi. People should know from well-chosen illustrations
how khadi can bring and has brought prosperity to the villages.
People should come in touch with sincere workers who are habitual
wearers of khadi and should be enabled to know how to prepare their
own khadi in their own villages. Congress workers should therefore
have a competent knowledge of the boycott and khadi literature, they
must be honest wearers of khadi and they must know the cotton
processes sufficiently so as to be able to instruct those who would
know how to gin, card, spin or even weave.
Those therefore who realize that boycott of foreign cloth and
manufacture and use of khadi are permanent institutions of the
highest economic value will welcome the Settlement which enables
them to know how far the people have been converted to the national
ideal. Our real strength must lie in the people doing in normal times
the things they did in abnormal times under the severe pressure of
public opinion or worse.
One word as to the mills. I have no tender spot in me for our
mills. They are well able to take care of themselves. They have still
many limitations to overcome. They have not yet put the national
interest before that of the agents, owners and share-holders. But after
having said all this I would like the correspondent to test the trut of
the fact thath they have striven this time to respond to the national call
be it to ever so small an extent. And this apart from the financial aid
they might have given to the movement. I should count that help of
no import, if they did not regulate prices and production. I believe
that they made an honest attempt in that direction.
Much however has yet to be done by them. They have not yet
frankly recognized the premier place khadi has in national economy.
They have not net organized the foreign cloth merchants for change98        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIof their trade to swadeshi, they have not yet learnt the inestimable
value of regarding themselves as trustees for the whole nation
including the mill-hands. But this change will come if the Congres-
smen will play the game. conversion, not coercion, must be the aim.
Young India, 14-5-1931
 121. ANGLO-INDIANS
Dr. H. W. B. Moreno writes :1
I can noly say that every community would be on a par with
every other under the swaraj Constitution. I invite the attention of all
the minorities concerned to the Fundamental Rights Resolution2 of the
Congress. So far as the Working Committee could, it took care to see
that the rights of minorities were fully secured under that Resolution.
That Resolution is now before the Congress Committee with a view to
strengthening it. All those who have useful suggestions should send
them to the Committee for consideration.
But I know that this is not what Dr. Moreno wants. He wants to
know where the Anglo-Indians will come in specifically. My answer is
they would come in where their merit would take them. There would
most decidedly be nothing to prevent them from occupying the
highest position that any other Indian may be capable of occupying.
The fact however is that the AngloIndians as a class have occupied or
attempted to occupy the position of rulers. They have not as a class
taken part in the national movement. They have isolated themselves in
their favoured position. Under swaraj there will be no favoured posi-
tion for anybody. Hence like the Englishmen whose cry for equality
means retention of favoured position the Anglo-Indians may feel
aggrieved that they would be at a disadvantage under swaraj if they
did not have the present favoured position guaranteed.
I hope however that Dr. Moreno has no such favouritism in
view. If I know him correctly, I expect he seeks information about the
sub-merged Anglo-Indians. Of them I can say with confidence that I
should be surprised if they did not in common with the submerged of
the other communities find themselves in a better position than they

the position of the Anglo-Indian community would be under the new constitution for
India.

                                   are in today. Anyway, there are enough Congressmen who are
pledged to the abolition of all unjust privileges, all unnatural inequ-
alities. If the condition of the masses is found to undergo rapid
improvement under swaraj, the Anglo-Indian poor must share it to the
fullest extent possible. The Congress aims at swaraj for the whole
nation and not a section. And it will fight on till that end is achieved. I
therefore invite all the minorities to join the national movement and to
hasten the advent of the happy day. Let it not also be said of any of
them that in the hour of the nation’s trial, they stood aside and came
in to enjoy their share of the happiness. They will get the share but
they will not relish it even as a man who has not toiled for his meal
cannot enjoy it though it is placed before him.

122. THE ALLAHABAD CONGRESS HOSPITAL :
AN APPEAL
In June last year Pandit Motilal Nehru visited Bombay and saw the
good work that the Congress hospital was doing there. He was impressed by
this and, on his return to Allahabad, he expressed a desire that a similar
hospital be started in Allahabad also. . . . Largely owing to the generosity of
friends in Bombay, some funds and material were collected for the proposed
hospital. On pandit Motilalji’s discharge from prison, the hospital was
formally started in a wing of Swaraj Bhawan. . . .
The limited funds collected have now been exhausted and the committee
had to consider whether it should continue the hospital or not. . . .
This appeal for financial assistance is therefore being issued in the hope
that there will be a generous response to it. The question of having a
permanent hospital in Swaraj Bhawan has not been decided yet. But the
committee would like to have sufficient funds for the carrying on of the
hospital for at least three years. The estimated expenditure on the hospital, if
it is run on its present limited scale, is rupees one thousand a month. . . .

I hope that the foregoing appeal1 will receive a quick res-  
ponse from the public. It has been purposely not signed by any   
except those who are connected with the management of the   
hospital, because it is not to be in any way considered as a national

Thirty-six thousand rupees to carry out a wish of Pandit Motilal
Nehru is a paltry sum. I hope, therefore, that there will be no delay
and no hesitation in responding to the appeal made by Shrimati
Kamala Nehru and her co-signatories. The reader should know that
from the commencement of the hospital she has been its  soul. The
public may wonder why the appeal treats the hospital as a temporary
thing. The idea is to watch how the institution works and by actual
experience to know what will be the real need. Moreover, whilst
everything is in the melting pot, it was thought that the wisest course
would be for the time being to be satisfied with meeting the daily
need.

123. FOR THE DANDI PILGRIMS
All the fellow pilgrims who undertook the march to Dandi on
12th March 19301 being scattered all over and not being in constant
touch with me, it is necessary to remind them through these columns
that   they are still under the same discipline and vows that they took
before beginning the march and after. They are therefore expected to
keep an accurate diary of the day’s work from day to day, to attend to
the two prayers, to keep their wants as low as possible and therefore to
keep their diet as simple as possible and to dothe daily sacrificial
spinning. Those who are living in villages can conduct village schools,
teaching the children in addition to a knowledge of the three R’s,
hand-spinning and other processes of cotton,insisting on their atten-
ding to personal hygiene and village games and athletics, doing
village cleaning themselves, seeking at the same time the assistance of
the villagers and their children and collecting and tabulating all the
necessary information about the villagers. The workers would also
find out those using foreign cloth and intoxicating drinks and drugs
and try to wean them from both by paying them friendly visits and
otherwise creating public opinion in the villages in these matters. They
will wherever possible and necessary organize peaceful picketing. Of
course they would seek to remove untouchability. The workers should
send to Sjt. Chhaganlal Joshi a report every month of their work
including an abstract from their diary. Needless to say they are

                                   expected to keep an accurate account of every pice they may spend    
and receive.
While these instructions are meant for and binding on the origi-
nal pilgrims, they may serve as a guide for all the national workers as
well in cities as in villages. There will be naturally some changes in the
cities. There is no Hindu-Muslim quarrel in the villages but national
workers in cities have to add this essential service to the others.

124. HOW THEY ARE TAUGHT
A correspondent who gives his name and address writes from
Wilmington, North Carolina.1
The newspapers tell of your efforts together with many others of your
nation for momplete independence, which is good in itself, but they also give
accounts of Indian life and that show that you lack understanding what freedom
really is and upon what it rests in the beginning. . . .
India is trying for independence by her very endeavour from God’s Rule
as well as from a Christian nation, whereas the greatest enemy of India are the
majority of Indians, who neither thoroughly understand God’s Holy Will or
even her Christian neighbour, England.
Just as it was an act of charity and goodness on the part of God to prvide
more ample clothing for the fallen and erring parents of ours, mine as well as
yours, so is the endeavour of England and others to provide for India more
cloth only as an act of Christian charity and goodness. . . .
India should first of all seek ample clothing and education on the Holy
Will of God as narrated in Holy Scripture as a base to obtain independence. . . .
The greatest enemy of India causing the most oppression and suffering
is ignorance on your own part and that of the people, not England. . . .
I have made hardly two alterations in the text for easier reading.
The correspondent addresses me “Dear friend in Jesus Christ”. His
sincerity is as clear as his ignorance. The reason why I publish the
letter is to show how even in the enlightened West people can be mis-
taught. In this letter there is ignorance of history and, if I may venture
to say so, ignorance even of the Bible. This letter represents teaching
of one type.
 A correspondent from New York the other day sent me cuttings
1 Only extracts are reproduced here.102        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIshowing how events in India were misreported and misrepresented.
The correspondent warned me against being deceived by the attention
paid to me by American Pressmen here into believing that the whole
of America was bubbling with enthusiasm for us. He implied that for
one sympathetic message or article there were ninety-nine prejudiced
articles or reports belittling everything Indian.
Reginald Reynolds cites a third variety. He thinks that the
English people from their infancy have no chance of knowing the
truth about India. False history is dinned into the ears of boys and
girls. The table talk too about India is no better. Of this type of
teaching we here have also some experience. We know what history we
learn in schools and what we have to unlearn by bitter experience. We
are taught to imagine the blessings and virtues of British rule; we
learn, as we grow, to know the contrary. Our greatest enemy is there-
fore ignorance spread often wilfully to prejudice us. It is true that we
have also to clean our own stables but not in the sense and the manner
suggested by the Wilmington correspondent.

125. ‘JUDGE LYNCH DECIDES’
A correspondent writes :
I am taking the liberty of enclosing herewith a small cutting from the
Literary Digest which will speak for itself. I wonder what you think of the
whole shameful affair? I dare say you meet many an American visitor or
interviewer who often demand of you a message to their country or invite you
to their continent. Would it be too much to ask of you to give them a message
to see that such atrocities as lynching of a hapless and coloured race are put a
stop to?
The cutting he referred to has the above heading and reads as
follows:1
This does make sad reading. If we had no faith in the ultimate
Good, we would lose all hope. I have faith and therefore hope that this
lynching will yield place to proper justice. I do not pretend to the
influence over American opinion that the correspondent credits me
with. But I have no doubt that the people of that continent are fully
alive to the evil and are trying their best to remove this blot on
American humanity.

like to accept the offer of Miss Muriel Lester who has an institution of
hers somewhere in the East End. But as I do not know the ins and outs

129. LETTER TO SURESH CHANDRA BANERJI
AS AT SABARMATI ,
May 14, 1931
MY DEAR SURESH,
I have your letter. I do not see anything on the horizon to
warrant the hope that peace will be established as a result of the Round
Table Conference. On the contrary, as I have said openly, nature
seems to be against us. I hold it to be impossible practically to get the
constitution we want without a heart unity amongst the different
communities. That unity is not likely to be forthcoming in the near
future. There are many other things too that are against us. But as
God confounds man’s hopes and out of his disappointments brings
forth hope, it is difficult to say precisely what is going to happen. My
business-like answer to you therefore is you should hope for the best,
prepare for the worst, but a satyagrahi’s preparation for the worst and
the best is always the same. You would still be spreading the gospel of
the wheel. You would still be nursing the needy sick. You would still
be looking after the pauper children and things of this kind are the
best preparation for civil disobedience and the like when they come.

130. LETTER TO HARIBHAU UPADHYAYA
FIRGROVE , SIMLA
May 14, 1931
DEAR HARIBHAU,
Bapuji has received your letter of the 10th. He has already expressed his
opinion about writing to Bhopal. As far as I remember the letter he wrote you was
posted on 6-5-31 from Borsad1. But your letter does not contain even an
acknowledgement. I too had written to you a separate letter. In that letter I had
suggested that you should inform Bapu of the latest and up-to-date position in regard
to repression in princely states. That too you have disregarded. What does all this
mean?
Your letter of the 10th was shown to Jamnalalji as per Bapu’s instructions. On
persuing it he remarked that Bapuji had already written regarding Bhopal, that he does
not consider it proper for him to write to Nawabs and Rajas about such matters in the
present circumstances. But Jamnalalji himself had written to Bikaner and he will do
whatever else is necessary.
About satyagraha, he does think that it was launched in haste but now it
cannot be remedied. He wishes to repeat the warning that we should guard against any
kind of mistake or violence on our part.
Yours,
PYARELAL

May 14, 1931
You will like to hear why I have come to Simla and what talk    I
am having with the Government. I cannot tell you everything, but I
can tell you that I came to hold consultation with regard to the
complaints on our side as well as on the Government side with regard
to the Settlement arrived at between Lord Irwin and the Congress.
These consultations still continue. What I have to emphasize is that if
you are Congress sewak1 and want to serve Hindustan, then it is your
duty to observe that Agreement irrespective of whether the Govern-
ment observes it or not.
After we have fulfilled our obligation, and if after that we    find
the Government has not fulfilled it we can take whatever step we like.
We know that whatever settlement has been arrived at is conditional,
but if we can use the settlement for some work, we  should do it.
As a satyagrahi, if we get an opportunity for service as a fesult
of understanding, we should welcome it. That opportunity came your
way through the Settlement.
The Karachi Congress practically unanimously adopted it. Now
our duty is what I have described. Do not think that after this
Settlement we have to go to war. We should, on the other hand, do
everything to see that we are not led to war and that the Settlement
should become permanent, so that we may get purna swaraj.
You know the conditions that have been imposed by Congress
on such of your delegates as will go to London to attend the Round
Table Conference. But if, as the result of settlement, we cannot get
complete swaraj, it is our ill-luck, and if our efforts towards a
permanent settlement fail, we should be ready for a fresh struggle.
But there are two points more which I wish to emphasize  
besides the Settlement. If we wish to achieve what we want  at the
Round Table Conference, we must be properly equipped :and that
equipment is that all the people of India—people who are born here
and have made India their home, whether Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs,
Christians, Parsis and others—should unite in the demand for swaraj.
Unless we bring about such an understanding among ourselves my
going to London is useless. Therefore we should all make such efforts
as would make for unity among all communities in this country.
1 VolunteerVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 107
                                   But I do not want unity on paper. If we write out a pact on
paper, unity is not thereby achieved. The unity I want is the unity of
heart and for that unity I always pray. And when that unity is achieved
you will gain such strength as will give us success.
I am afraid my voice is not reaching you all and that you are
feeling upset by rain. Let me pray to God that we may be saved a
second struggle and that this Settlement may lead to final success.
As regards work, you have the Congress resolution before you
and you have every scope for work in respect of the spread of
khaddar and boycott of liquor. I thank you all.

132. HOMAGE TO K. T. PAUL
SIMLA,
May 15, 1931
I had the privilege of knowing Mr. K. T. Paul. The nearer I
came to him the more I respected him. His Christianity appeared to
me to be broad and tolrant. It not only did not interfere with his being
a thorough nationalist, on the contrary, in his case it seemed to have
deepened his nationalism. And in nationalist circles it will always be
remembered, to the credit of the deceased, that he stoutly opposed the
demand for any special concessions for Christian Indians in the
forthcoming constitution, believing as he did that character and merit
would always command not only proper treatment but respectful
attention. His death especially at this time in the life of the nation is a
distinct loss to the country.

Mahatma Gandhi said his conversation was healthy and good and he was not
seeing the Viceroy again in Simla. He would be seeing Mr. Emerson, the Home
Secretary, again tomorrow and leaving Simla for Nainital positively on the 17th,
Sunday.1
Mahatma Gandhi refused the answer the question if he was more optimistic
regarding his going to London and the general political situation, and added :
Fro any further information you must go to the Viceregal Lodge.
While walking towards Sir Fazl Hussain’s residence, he was asked whether he
would favour Simla as the seat of the Swaraj Government. He replied:
We must go down five thousand storeys to the plains, for
government should be among the people and for the people.

DEAR FRIEND,
I thank you for your cablegram which has been redirected      
to me here. I am not replying by cable as my opinion remains the
same as I explained to you in a previous letter. I gave you only one
reason preventing me from going to London. But I should have
mentioned another also namely the work of the Settlement. Though I
am receiving help at the centre, local authorities are giving great deal
of trouble in implementing the Settlement and they are accusing local
Congressmen of breach on their part. I have ample evidence and I am
investigating every case of breach on the part of individuals, but in the
vast majority of cases Congressmen have fully implemented the Settle-
ment. I am making no mention whatsoever of breach on the part of
the authorities whilst I am still negotiating with them and in the hope
that things will be put right in the near future. But this thing practi-
cally takes away all my time and keeps me in India.

HOW TO END DARKNESS ?
A graduate asks:1
This is partly true. In a letter which is lying along with the
above, I find the following: “Amongst us, the expenses incurred on  
the death of a person have been completely stopped, there is less of
weeping and wailing, marriages are becoming simpler, and less expen-
sive.”This is not surprising. Such reforms ought to come about at the
end of a great sacrifice. What, however, is surprising is that despite the
sacrifice, despite correct understanding of the situation, untouchability
has not been totally uprooted. At many places the untouchables are
still prohibited from drawing water from the village well, their children
cannot freely attend all public schools, caste distinctions and conside-
rations of high and low still persist, mutual quarrels still take place,
girls continue to be sold, young men continue to expect to receive
cash from a girl’s father.
What is the reason for this?
Our attention is directed outwards, we do not look within our-
sleves. We find it exciting to fight the Government. We adopt those
reforms which are absolutely necessary for carrying on that struggle
and continuing it. But we find no excitement in fighting against our-
selves, in carrying on a peaceful war against society, or we find it less
exciting to do so.
Who will end this laxity?
Volunteers, graduates of the Vidyapith, women volunteers and
vanarsena  2 “But if the salt hath lost its savour, wherewith shall it be
salted?” The volunteers—both men and women—find this work
uninteresting. They do not realize that swaraj cannot be won if these
tasks are not done, or even if it is won, it cannot be preserved. It is
clear as daylight that swaraj is nothing but the development of all
sections of the people. Hence if the rural workers now come forward
in large numbers and carry out these tasks silently and with determ-
ination and diligence, darkness will disappear and dawn will break.

143. OPINION UNCHANGED
Commenting on the article entitled “A Twentieth-Century Sati
(?)4”, Shri Mathuradas Devram writes as follows :5
I have published this letter for the sake of fairness. My opinion
re-mains unaltered even after having known all these facts. The facts
as they were published have been corroborated and so my grief is all
the greater and my opinion has been strengthened. This is an example
not of love but of strong emotion. What does man not do when
overcome by emo-tion? If that very woman had survived, she could
have perpetuated her husband’s memory by her dedicated life.
Having died, she did not accom-pany her husband. It is an error to
believe that the relationship ends as soon as the body perishes. But
even if that were at all true, she could not preserve that relationship.
Just as her husband’s body was reduced to ashes, hers too was reduced
to ashes; hence along with the departure of the one, the other too
followed suit. In this pathetic incident, I find noth-ing at all praise-
worthy. I hope that even this woman’s relatives do not consider this
suicide as the act of a sati. Rather than teach women to love their

5  The letter is not translated here. It had described and justified the action of
the woman who had burnt herself on the pyre of her husband.114        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIhusbands blindly, we should liberate them and show them through our
conduct that the soul in a woman has equal rights with the soul in a
man.
Now about Shri Mathuradas’s last question. In the sentence “A
woman who is a sati will participate in the function of procreation
within limits,” the phrase ‘a woman who is a sati’ has been used to
denote a woman of good character whose husband is alive. My ideal is
to make husbands and wives practise total celibacy. If that is not
possible, my purpose was to say that both should, within limits,
participate in the function of procreation. That is to say, sexual union
between the two should be permitted only for the sake of this function
and that too for the limited number of children that both desire. This,
in my opinion, is limited self-restraint.

144. PUBLIC EXPENSE1
No province in India has enjoyed such privileges in the matter
of public funds as Gujarat. The Gujarat Provincial Congress
Committee has never found its exchequer empty. Nor have its district
or taluk branches ever been left to want the funds that they needed. It
has been my conviction for years that such affluence cannot be good
for any public institution. There comes a point in the life of every
institution that has a prestige in public, when it experiences this
plethora of funds and all the risks and dangers attendant on it. At that
time, if it does not take care and does not spend like a miser, it is
bound to come to grief. Because an institution happens to have plenty
of funds it does not mean that it should anyhow spend away every pie
that it possesses. The golden rule is not to hesitate to ask for or spend
even a crore when it is absolutely necessary and when it is not, to
hoard up every pie though one may have a crore of rupees at one’s
disposal.
I am afraid that this golden rule has not been always followed
by the Gujarat Committees. In fact I should not be surprised if I
discovered the existence even of a certain laxity in this respect. I
would therefore suggest to every Taluka and District Congress
1 The original Gujarati of this was published in Navajivan on May 17. This is
a translation by Pyarelal.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 115
                                   committee in Gujarat to hold a close scrutiny into its accounts and to
relentlessly apply the axe wherever it is found to be necessary. We
may not build a pucca building when a thatched cottage would do. We
may not use a motor-car when a bullock-cart would serve the purpose
and we must avoid the bullock-cart when the journey can be made on
foot. Similarly the rigidest economy should be exercised in regulating
the expenses of feeding the workers. The best course would be for all
Congress organizations to get their account books inspected by some
experienced person who knows how to economize public expenditure
and to invite criticisms and suggestions from him for future guidance.
Ten years ago there used to be a golden rule in Gujarat that every
District, Village or Taluka Congress Committee was expected to raise
sufficient funds at least for its needs  and to deposit them with the
Provincial Congress Committee. The practice remained in force for
some years and then fell into abeyance. Now all district organizations
draw upon the Provincial Committee for funds. This is a dangerous
situation. What guarantee is there that the exchequer of the Provincial
Congress Committee will always remain brimful? Nor is it right for the
Provincial Congress Committee to entertain such an ambition. It is
therefore high time that the good old rule were revived. We may rest
assured that funds will automatically come when there is good work
done and there is need for them. Only we shall have to cultivate
sufficient self-confidence and faith in our mission. It would be worth
while to draw attention here to the rule laid down by the Congress in
this connection. The All-India National Congress does not supply
funds to the provinces; it is the latter that are required to contribute
ten per cent of their income to the central organization. Why should
not this rule apply to the provincial organizations as well? And why
should not the districts be made to contribute ten per cent or a fair
proportion of their income to provincial organizations? It is simply
ridiculous for the provinces to be required to finance district
organizations. In fact it is almost like a person trying to walk on his
head instead of naturally on his feet. Such topsyturvydom cannot last
for long.
“But what about times of emergency?” some doubting reader
will perhaps, here, ask. “Do these rules of economy prescribed by
you apply even when the country is in a state of war?” My reply is :
“Certainly they do, even more when war is going on than when all is
safe and well.” God forbid, but should fighting have to be resumed,
we shall need to have the capacity to carry on with the minimum of116        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfunds or even without funds. It is a fundamental principle of satya-
graha that the tyrant whom the satyagrahi seeks to resist has power
over his body and material possessions but he can have no power over
the soul. The soul can remain unconquered and unconquerable even
when the body is imprisoned. The whole science of satyagraha was
born from a knowledge of this fundamental truth. In the purest form
of satyagraha there should be no need for conveyances, carriage fare
or even of doing Hijrat1. And in case Hijrat has to be performed it will
be done by journeying on foot. The Hijratis would have to be satis-
fied with whatever hard fare falls to   their lot and keep smiling when
even that fails. When we have developed this ‘be careful for nothing’
attitude, we shall be saved from many a botheration and trouble and
freedom will dance attendance upon us. Nor should one suppose that
a ‘careful for nothing’ person shall have always to be starving. God
that provides the little ant its speck of food and to the elephant his
daily one maund bolus will not neglect to provide man with his daily
meal. Nature’s creatures do not worry or fret about tomorrow but
simply wait on tomorrow for the daily sustenance. Only man in his
overweaning pride and egotism imagines himself to be the lord and
master of the earth and goes on piling up for himself goods that
perish. Nature tries every day by its rude shocks to wean him from his
pride but he refuses to shed it. Satyagraha is a specific for bringing
home to one the lesson of humility. We have travelled so much
distance during the last year, we have gone through so much suffering
and had so many rich experiences that we ought to have sufficient
faith in us to be able to feel that if we throw ourselves upon God’s
mercy untroubled by doubt or fear, it would be well with us.

MY DEAR SUBBIAH,
I got your letter just as I was moving from Borsad. Since then
there has been no time before now. I understand your difficulties. I
am therefore sending your letter to Rajaji and asking him to relieve
you as soon as he can. This is unfortunate but it is inevitable. I agree
with you that you must be with Seshan and you owe a duty to Lalita
also. Your indifferent health is an additional reason for relieving you.
I shall be in Borsad about the end of this month. We are leaving Simla
this afternoon to go to Nainital which we reach tomorrow, Monday. If
your health permits, you will not leave Rajaji till he is otherwise suited
and you should leave him with the intention of returning to him
whenever you are free and he needs you.

148. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS
May 17, 1931
Mahatma Gandhi stated that he was on the whole satisfied with his visit and he
was able to understand that so far as the Central Government was concerned they were
trying to give effect to the terms of the Delhi Pact. He reiterated his attitude that he
would go to the London Conference if the communal question was solved and if there
was a satisfactory working of the Pact throughout India.
As for the communal problem itself he recognized there was a good deal of
mistrust but after Bhopal discussion; he was more optimistic.
QUESTION. Supposing you or the Congress do not attend the Round Table
Conference and the Conference produces a constitution which is approved by
Parliament. What would be the attitude of the Congress?
 ANSWER. I may speak on behalf of the Congress that it will
examine the scheme and if good, will certainly work it.
Q.Do you believe in self-determination?
A.Yes.
Q.Would you allow any province to exercise self-determination and
separate herself from India?
A.I shall fight through reason but shall not impose my will by
force of arms.
Pressed regarding his views on the communal problem, he reiterated his
position that if the Sikhs and Mohammedans presented agreed demands, he would
accept them unhesitatingly1.
1 What follows is from The Statesman.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 119
                                   When asked whether he did not think it a pity that nation-wide progress should
wait for local settlements, he said:
Well, if we can look after the pennies, we can look after the
pounds too. Why do I insist on this? These local settlements are like
the straws which show the way the wind is blowing, and that wind may
turn the weather-vane even of the Round Table Conference—even
perhaps veer it right round.
Q.The Bombay Chronicle says: “Need we repeat that the most effective
method speeding up the work of the Round Table Conference and making it
completely successful, is to intensify the boycott of foreign cloth?’ That obviously
means that The Bombay Chronicle regards the boycott as a political weapon and as a
discriminatory weapon, because a boycott of Japanese cloth could hardly speed up the
work of the Round Table Conference. Don’t you think that that sort of talk is
inconsistent with both the spirit and the letter of the Delhi Agreement?
A.I have not seen the article from which you have quoted.
But   I can say broadly that it would be inconsistent both with the
spirit   and the letter of the Pact to think of the foreign-cloth boycott
as a political weapon. Foreign cloth includes Japanese cloth just as
much   as British cloth, if not much more at present, for the simple
reason    that it ousts khadi and Indian mill cloth far more effectively
than    British cloth. The economic and social reasons for the boycott
are all-sufficing.
Q.How far are you prepared to go to conciliate the British Conservatives’
anxiety about safeguards?
A.To the utmost extent, consistent with the interests and
honour of India.
 In answer to the question whether he thought the local difficulties in respect
of the Agreement would be removed, say by July, Gandhiji replied:
That I can’t say. But of course, I hope so, and I have hopes that
they will.
Q.And the Hindu-Muslim question? What do you think of the steps taken at
the Bhopal meetings of Muslims?
A.They are encouraging, and both the Muslim parties are
evidently doing their best to arrive at unity among themselves. But, of
course, when I speak of the Hindu-Muslim question I mean the entire
communal question. When the Hindu-Muslim side of the matter is
brought up, the Sikhs, for instance, will have their say. There will be
difficulties. I hope that they will not prove insurmountable.120        THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIQ.So you will really go to Round Table Conference, whether early or late,
when those two problems are out of the way?
A.Yes, certainly. And I shall be very pleased to go, because I
hope that when I get to England I shall find the British people not
uninterested in what I have to say and open to conviction by what I
tell them. Or, at the worst, I hope I shall persuade them that I am only
a harmless lunatic.
Q.And Lord Rothermere?
A.Oh yes. . . . even Lord Rothermere.

149.  MESSAGE TO KARNATAK PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE  1
[May 18, 1931  ]2
The resolution on fundamental rights is the most important
resolution of the Congress. It shows what kind of swaraj the Congress
wants to achieve. That swaraj is the poor man’s swaraj or Ramarajya.
Rama symbolized justice and equity, Rama symbolized truth and
charity.
The resolution insists on religious toleration, which means, that
no one will be prevented from discharging his religious obligations,
and the State shall favour no religion.
 Justice and equity mean the establishment of just and equitable
relation between capital and labour, between the landlord and the
tenant. The landlord and the capitalist will cease to exploit the tenant
and the labourer but will studiously protect his interests.
Not that these things will be there as a matter of course as soon
as we get the powers. I only mean that they will follow as the natural
consequence of truth and non-violence if swaraj is achieved by those
means. The question is whether we are following truth and non-
violence. Ramarajya  cannot be the result of truth and non-violence
followed as a mere temporary expedient or policy. Ramarajya  can
only come out of truth and non-violence pursued as a creed.  Could a
son ever fulfil his filial duties as a policy? Policy is essentially a
temporary expedient which one might alter as circums-tances  altered.
1 Vide also “Letter to Jamnalal Bajaj”, 8-5-1931
2 According to Mahadev Desai, Gandhiji wrote this message “last Monday”.
May 18 was a Monday.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931 121
                                   It  is  easy  enough  to  follow  truth  and non-violence so long as no
sacrifice or suffering is involved, but he who adheres to them in all
circumstances even at the cost of life follows them as a creed. It is time
truth and non-violence were a creed and not policy with us
Congressmen.
Let us therefore find out what parts of the resolution we can
enforce even now. If we do not enforce the things that can be
enforced today, swaraj will be meaningless, for we will not suddenly
do after swaraj things which we can do but will not do today.
The resolution states that there shall be no untouchability under
the swaraj constitution. Have we cast out the canker of untouch-
ability? The resolution says under the swaraj constitution there shall
be no facilities for the licensing of liquor and drug shops. Have we
cast out the drug and drink evil from our midst? The resolution goes
on to say that under swaraj all foreign cloth would be banned from
India. But have we given up our infatuation for foreign cloth and
become khaddar clad? Similarly under swaraj, according to this
resolution, Hindus and Mussalmans and Christians will live together
like true blood brothers. Have we cleansed our hearts of distrust and
suspicion of one another? Under swaraj, which the resolution pictures,
there shall be no hatred or ill-will between the rich and the poor. Have
the rich identified themselves with the poor, and have the poor ceased
to have ill-will toward the rich? Under the swaraj constitution we want
the maximum monthly emoluments of officials not to exceed Rs. 500.
But do those who are getting more today devote the balance to
philanthropic purposes? Have our millionaires adjusted their standard
of living to this scale of payment?
It is difficult to give a decisive reply to these questions today.
We are today slowly groping our way towards our ideal of Ramarajya
or the Kindgom of Righteousness. This resolution is intended to keep
this goal constantly before our eyes and to stimulate our endeavours
to attain it.

should know cooking and also how to run a home. She should know
how to keep accounts. It would be excellent if she knew a little Sans-

Kikibehn? If there are these bhandars going on, would it not be an
interference with the existing bhandars? You will do what Shankerlal
suggests. If the Karachi project falls through or even if it does not, I
would certainly like your settling down in a village. I attach far greater
importance to it than to city work. But you can settle down in a village
only if Syt. Choithram and Jairamdas agree. I have always felt that

the circumstances to constitute Chittagong,  Dacca,  and Rajshahi Divisions of
Bengal in to a separate  province.   In that ase Muslims will be about 70% in East
Bengal, and Hindus will predominate in West Bengal.   Similarly if Ambala Division
is separated from the Punjab, the Muslims population in the rest of the Punjab would
be raised from 56% to 65%.  If the Muslims got effective majority in the newly
constituted provinces of Punjab and East Bengal, I am sure they will have no
difficulty in accepting joint electrorates.”130       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI168. LETTER TO  DR. GOPICHAND BHARGAVA

DEAR DR. GOPICHAND,
I have your letter1 of 16th instant. I had to discuss a similar
question with Mr. Emerson. I found that under ordinance 9, there was
no question of compensation. I am afraid therefore that there is no

1 The addressee had passed on to Gandhiji the information received from the
manager of Peshawar Khadi Bhandar that in 1930 the Government had confiscated all
the goods, cash registers and cash box containing Rs. 198 and personal effects of the
manager and that even after the Settlement only onefourth of the goods and the
broken cash box had been returned.  He had requested Gandhiji to take up this matter
with Emerson.

AS AT SABARMATI ,
May 19, 1931
DEAR MR. DAVID,
I have your letter of the 14th. I see that you are pushing forward
your programme of goodwill. You know that you have my sympathy
in your laudable endeavour and just now I feel that I can best serve
the common purpose by saying nothing in Young India that might in
any way hamper you. The letter to Lord Irwin of young Europeans, I
am ashamed to have to confess, I had not seen. I am therefore thank-
ful for the copy you have considerately sent me. It is undoubtedly a
good letter. Lord Irwin”s reply is worthy of him.
The proposed manifesto is still, I suppose, a private document.
The reference to fair trade and living conditions requires a closer
examination. I suppose you are aware that Indians in great Britain do
not enjoy the rights 'the manifesto assumes they do enjoy. There can
be no comparison between the Indian demands in South Africa and
the European demand in India. The Indian in South Africa suffers
from social, commercial and legal disabilities and is treated as an
inferior being. The Indian demand therefore is to rise to a status of
equality. The European in India enjoys in every walk of life a position
of privilege and his demand for equality is tantamount to the retention
of the privileged position. When, therefore, India comes [in] to her
own, Europeans are bound to feel the pinch if they are not satisfied,
that to be just, the position of privilege must be surrendered. Apart
from this the European in Free India has not only nothing to fear but
his resourcefulness and his ability will always make him a desirable
citizen.

I got your letter, and also Surendra’s. The news is painful, but
cases like this are bound to occur at a time of awakening such as the
present. We cannot inform the authorities, as that might lead to the
punishing of innocent people. Informing the authorities would have
been a breach of trust, and I cannot, at the moment at any rate, think
of any case or example in which breach of trust becomes a duty. It is
one thing when a man puts confidence in us and confesses a crime,
another when we come to have indirect information regarding any-
body’s crime. In certain circumstances it may be our duty to make
use of the information indirectly received, but no such duty arises in
this case at all. Hence your job at present is to bring about a refor-
mation, by whatever means, among those now engaged in terrorism.

Replying to the address Mahatmaji referred to his interview with the
Governor2 and said that at such a time as this a man in his position could not say as
much as the public might be expecting from him. He further said that non-violence
was their duty so long as the Congress did not decide otherwise. He further asked the
citizens what they had done towards the propagation of khaddar which they had

towards helping the attainment of swaraj, without which, he said, India could not be
free. He impressed upon them that by merely going to the Round Table Conference he
could not achieve all that the Congress was fighting for unless the people stuck to
their duties which is the precedent condition for the attainment of swaraj.

181. CONGRESS VOTERS
A correspondent asks :
At the time of elections to Congress Committees
1.Can a Congress candidate register original Congress members and
himself pay the four-anna fee ?
2.In order to obtain votes can a candidate send conveyances at his own
expense to the voters ?
3.In order to influence voters can a candidate give feasts to voters?
4.Can a voter take part in voting although he is not a habitual wearer of
khadi?
These are very relevant questions. My answer to the first three
questions is that although the practice would be very reprehensible, I
very much fear that there is nothing in the consti-  tution and there are
no bye-laws preventing it. My answer regarding the fourth is an
emphatic ‘no’. Thus therefore though a candidate can, if he wishes,
pay the registration fee on behalf of the members and send them
conveyances and give them feasts in  order to induce them to vote for
him I do hope that for their own sakes and for the sake of the
Congress and the country candidates will refrain from resorting to any
practice that might amount to bribery or an improper inducement. I
have never been able to understand this craze for membership of
Congress Committees, and Congress Committees formed in such a
manner instead of being instruments of service can easily become
those of mischief and disservice. So far as the habitual wearing of
khadi is concerned there is no doubt that the rule is more often
broken than observed. It is a remarkable phenomenon that habitual
wearers of khadi, and they are thousands, do not care to appear on the
Congress register and those who are on the Congress register do not,
in many cases, take the trouble of wearing khadi. One reason for the
laxity is that partisans are brought in at the eleventh hour nominally to
become members and to disappear from view as soon as the elections
are over. New lists are made at new elections or even bye-elections. In138       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIspite of this tragic fact, the Congress is daily growing in power. It is
becoming more and more popular. It attracts more and more crowds.
Its mandates find ready acceptance from the vast mass of people. This
phenomenon can only be explained on the supposition that though
the Congress has indifferent representatives, somehow or other it
represents and voices the wants and aspirations of the people who
remain unaffected by the improprieties of the representatives and
support the Congress merely for what it stands for without looking
into or caring for the quality of its representatives. If my analysis is
correct, the moral is obvious. The Congress will cease to be the power
it is if the reprehensible practices referred to by the correspondent do
not cease. Congress workers will not always be indifferent.
Young India, 21-5-1931
182. NOTES
PICKETING
Congressmen should know that the Government of India have
been receiving complaints from the provincial Governments that
picketing is not always peaceful. I do not know how far these compl-
aints are justified. But we cannot be too strict in the observance of our
part of the Settlement irrespective of how the authorities implement
their part of it. Let us realize that the  stricter we are, the greater will be
our prestige and strength. I therefore repeat what I have said before:1
1.There should be no coercion direct or indirect.
2.There should be no show of intimidation, hence not more
than say five pickets should work at one and the same place at a time.
3.There should be no more than courteous entreaty and
distribution of literature.
4.There should be no fine levied by Congress Committees
for breach of promises by foreign-cloth dealers.
5.There should be no hooting of purchasers of foreign cloth.
6.There should be no cordons formed to surround the
would-be purchasers.
7.There should be no lying down to block the passage of
customers or trolleys carrying foreign cloth.
If there are those who think that picketing under such
restrictions will be of no avail, they may give it up and run the risk of
1 Vide “My Notes”, sub-title To Workers VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                               139foreign cloth being sold under their noses. It is better that foreign
cloth is sold than that, in order to prevent its sale, we should break the
letter or the spirit of the Settlement.
Boycott of foreign cloth will ultimately succeed only when the
Congress message has penetrated the masses and the khadi spirit per-
meates them. The real work of propaganda and production lies in the
villages.
We should remember too that boycott of foreign cloth is
pursued for its great economic and social consequence. And it is just
as necessary to boycott Japanese or Italian cloth or yarn as it is to
boycott British cloth or yarn. Indeed it is more necessary to boycott
Japanese cloth because it offers greater competition both tokhadi and
indigenous mill cloth. We have no ill-will against Japan. We pursue
foreign-cloth boycott because it is an economic necessity for the
nation.
What I have said about the method of picketing applies equally
to liquor picketing. That too depends for its ultimate success in
penetration into the home of the drinkers.
SETTLEMENT PRISONERS
I have been receiving complaints from many provinces saying  
that there are still unreleased prisoners covered by the IrwinGandhi
Settlement. These are claimed by the Governments   concerned as not
covered by the Settlement. The only way relief can be obtained in
such cases is to study the records of each case. I would therefore ask
all Committees who have sent me lists to examine the cases themselves
and where they are satisfied that the record shows violence (not
merely technical, or incitement thereto), they should for the time
being omit their names. Where the local examination shows that there
is no violence or incitement proved, they should send the record to me
and I shall go through such records myself and wherever necessary
obtain the opinion of some philanthropic counsel and press for their
release. Let it be remembered that according to the strict interpretation
of the relevant clause of the Settlement we shall have to go simply by
the record although those who know may be certain of the innocence
of any particular prisoner. Of those against whom the record gives no
proof of violence, we can demand release. Such was Sjt. Rajwade’s
case.
The other prisoners and their friends may derive satisfaction140       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfrom the assurance that in the event of a final Settlement their release
is a certainty and in the event of a breakdown in spite of all efforts,
they will find their old companions returning to them. For the result
they will not have to wait long.
POORMAN ’S SALT
I regret that as yet the public do not know how the salt law relief
clause of the Irwin-Gandhi Settlement is being worked. I have
suggested to the authorities that they should issue definite instructions
so that the people concerned may know where they stand. My sugges-
tion has been accepted by the authorities. The public therefore may
expect publication of the instructions in the near future.1
THAT AMERICAN VISIT2
Dr. Harry Ward writes
May I add a word to the cable which, with others, I sent you today.   First
let me emphasize the fact that the reason I previously gave against   your
coming to this country still holds now, and with increased force. Our  papers
have become increasingly sensational and you would be misrepre-  sented by
them, as well as exploited by the sensation-hunting section   of our
population. Thus your power to help us toward a better way of  life would be
seriously diminished, if not defeated. But the other reason  against your
coming is more important. I am sure that it would injure and  not help the cause
of India in your negotiation at London. There is under the surface a deep
English resentment against the United States. This is due to her economic
decline and our position of financial dominance. This feeling quickly seizes
upon any utterances about British policy as a means for its expression. Thus a
perfectly harmless appeal that some of use signed to MacDonald last year to
meet with you face to face and seek an adjustment, was the occasion of much
criticism of those who signed it, and of America in general, from British
ministers of religion. Also there has been much complaint in British papers
concerning our sympathy with the nationalist cause. Because British
propaganda no longer dominated the situation here we have been told that we
were only the victims of clever propaganda from nationalist sources. You can
see at once, therefore, that any manifestation of sympathy with India which
your presence here might evoke, would work strongly against you at London.

Father Elwin writing to Mirabehn says :
I thought I might tell you how I spent my three hours on Good Friday. I
did not go to Church but spent the time in my cell spinning. I am sending a
little of the yarn—very poor I am afraid—but it is a token. While spinning I
meditated on the crucifixion. It seemed to fit in very well—the cry of
desolation of God’s poor stretched on the cross of exploitation, the age-long
“I thirst” of those to whom the charkha with its message of love can bring
relief, the wonderful patience of the poor—“Father, forgive them for they
know not what they do.” The charkha then seemed to be the dual symbol of our
union with the poor and our union with God. It would be very good if people
would generally keep Good Friday in this way. It was a real experience of
purification.
I have examined the yarn sent by Father Elwin. It is by no
means poor in quality as he thinks. It is quite weavable. The count is
somewhere near 20. Nevertheless, I agree that it is poor for the sprit of
love and dedication that lay behind the sacrificial act. But no amount
of love or dedication can make up for the want of regular and long  
practice. If therefore I have agreed with the self-abasing verdict of
Father Elwin I have done so not by way of criticism but to tell those
who might be induced to turn to the spinning-wheel that they will  not
be satisfied with merely drawing the thread, for the thread thus drawn
will not be yarn, even as any angle drawn will not be a right angle. Just
as all right angles must be 90 degrees so must all yarn be even and
strong enough to be easily weavable. The count does not matter. A
spinner who draws an even and strong thread will automatically draw
at least a six count and if his wheel is good  and his spindle straight
and fine, he will draw without difficulty anything between 10 and 20
counts. I commend Father Elwin’s experience to all who love and
would identify themselves with the semi-starved millions of India.

Sjt. Satis Chandra Das Gupta of the Khadi Pratishthan is editing
a Bengali newspaper called Rastravani . He recently unearthed a letter
addressed to the Editor of Samachar Darpan  which was published in
Bengali in the twenties of the 19th century. As the letter was of great
importance showing how the charkha was being slowly destroyed and
how it was valued by women in those days, he has published it in his
paper and sent me its translation. I am sure, it will be read with
interest by all who are at all interested in the khadi movement. Here is
the letter :1
The representation of a spinner
To the Editor, Samachar
I am a spinner. After having suffered a great deal, I am writing this letter.
Please publish this in your paper. . . .
When my age was five and a half gandas (22) I became a widow with
three daughters. My husband left nothing at the time of his death. . . . I sold
my jewellery for his shraddha ceremony. At last as we were on the verge of
starvation God showed me a way by which we could save ourselves. I began to
spin on takli and charkha. . . .
The weavers used to visit our houses and buy the charkha yarn at three
tolas per rupee. Whatever amount I wanted as advance from the weavers, I could
get for the asking. This saved us from cares about food and cloth.
In a few years’ time I got together seven ganda rupees (Rs. 28). With
this I married one daughter. And in the same way all three daughters. . . .
Now for 3 years, we two women, mother-in-law and me are in want  of
food. The weavers do not call at the house for buying yarn. Not only   this, if
the yarn is sent to market still it is not sold even at one-fourth  the old prices.
I do not know how it happened. I asked many about it.  They  say  that  Bilati2
yarn is being largely imported.  The weavers buy that yarn and weave. I had a
sense of pride that Bilati yarn could not be equal to my yarn, but when I got
Bilati yarn I saw that it was better than my yarn. I heard that its price is Rs. 3
or Rs. 4 per seer. I beat my brow and said, “Oh God, there are sisters more
distressed even than me.” I know that all men of Bilat are rich but now I see
that there are women there who are poorer than me. I fully realized the poverty
which induced those poor women to spin. They have sent the product of so
much toil out here because they could not sell it there. It would have been

only. Man cannot use the cloth out of this yarn even for two months; it rots
away. I therefore entreat the spinners over there, that, if they will consider
this representation, they will be able to judge whether it is fair to send yarn
here or not.

The reader will not fail to observe the nobility of the writer who
in her blissful ignorance felt that yarn was spun by the hands of her
Bilati sisters poorer than herself and therefore felt for them. Alas, her
belief was baseless. She could have stood her own if the foreign yarn
had been hand-spun. She could have stood her own even against the
foreign yarn, if behind it there had been no policy of determination to
capture the Indian trade and kill the national village industry.

185. A WOMAN’S SACRIFICE
During the great awakening that took place last year amongst
women there were heroines whose mute work the nation will never
know. Now and then however one gets information of such village
work. Here is one such sample sent by a friend:1
When our Congress camp was declared illegal and locked up by the
police we shifted to the hut of a poor Mahishya woman—Habu’s mother of
Baradongal. We have read of Gorki’s mother. We saw her incarnate in   Habu’s
mother. Night and day she used to cook for us workers. She   nursed the sick
amongst us. She consoled those that were troubled  in heart and thus became
real mother to us who would other-  wise have felt motherless. We had
graduates and M.A.s amongst us proud of their educational gifts but all of us
were compelled to call Habu’s mother our own. Her sacrifice and great devotion
to duty commanded that homage from us.

DEAR DR. MAHMUD,
I know you are doing most valuable work. I am not going to
discuss with you how mass work can be most effectively done if only
because I hardly scrape together a few minutes to attend to corres-
pondence. I shall therefore reserve it for discussion when we meet.
As you see, I am writing this from Nainital where I saw the
Governor yesterday. No final conclusion was reached about the reve-
nue matters.
I leave for Gujarat in two or three days if not earlier. The earliest
we shall meet, I suppose, will be when the Working Committee meet-
ing takes place early next month. But of course you can anticipate
that date and meet me whenever you like. You need no appointment.
Do you?

190. LETTER TO MOHAMMED ISMAIL KHAN
AS AT SABARMATI ,
May 21, 1931
DEAR NAWAB SAHEB,
I thank you for your letter of 19th instant. I have not seen the
report you refer to in your letter. But I may state my position thus:
So far as I am concerned I should endorse without hesitation
any solution that Mussalman friends as a whole may present but that
by itself would not solve our difficulties. Our difficulties could only
be solved by either Hindus and Mussalmans settling with the Sikhs or
Hindus settling both with Mussalmans and Sikhs. But so far as I am
personally concerned I should endorse any solution presented by146       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHISikh friends as a whole as I would the Mussalman claim. But if there is
a conflict between the Sikh and the Mussalman claim, then my
endorsement of the claim of each would be of little value. I have
therefore assumed that whatever Mussalman friends or Sikh friends
present as a final claim would take note of the other party. If you find
any flaw in this, you will not hesitate to let me know. All I want is an
honourable settlement wholly satisfactory to the Mussalmans, to the
Sikhs as also to all other communities who may wish a communal
solution.
As to your other question supposing that I survive the future
constitution and am allowed to have any hand in its working I would
have no solution on any but strictly national lines and I would so work
the constitution that I should disarm all suspicion.
So far as the Europeans are concerned, the question is not what
privileges they should get by reason of their being in a minority but
what privilges they will surrender so as to be on a par with us. Am I
clear?
I would ask you to believe me to be the same man whom you
were good enough to have as your guest in Meerut in those days when
for the moment we had begun to think that we were but children of
the same mother having the same aspirations and having full trust in
one another.

DEAR SIR,
In reply to your telegram I have sent you the following:
Impossible give opinion without knowing full facts.
Subject to any change that might have to be made after knowing
further facts I can say that punitive tax imposed for anything done
since Settlement would be no violation thereof. Nor refusal to pay
such tax will necessarily be violation of Settlement. But those who will
embark upon no-tax campaign will do so after fullest consideration
and on their own sole responsibility.

197. SPEECH AT POLITICAL SUFFERERS’ CONFERENCE
KUMAON,
[May 21, 1931 ]1
You must have seen the resolution regarding the declaration of
fundamental rights passed by the Congress. There are a few items in it
such as the reduction of military expenditure to one half, which
cannot be achieved before swaraj, but there are other items such as
compulsory primary education, ban on foreign cloth, equality of
rights and opportunities, for which we should not wait till the esta-
blishment of swaraj. We should establish these conditions just now and
this will bring us nearer swaraj. We can open schools in every village,
manufacture and encourage khaddar and make wars on untou-
chability.
(Here Mahatmaji referred to each item in the declaration of rights as published
in an old issue of Young India seriatim.)
Referring to the maximum pay of the public servants, Mahatmaji said as 
follows :—
You should not think that this proposal is meant to remain on
paper. This will be enforced when swaraj is obtained. This was added
to the declaration of rights after full and careful consideration. I am
old and even if I die, Jawaharlal is certain to enforce it. But it is unjust
to suppose that old people die before young men, because it is not
God’s law. Let me assure you that this proposal will be enforced. In
Japan, which is an independent country, the maximum pay of public
servants is Rs. 500.
Ours is a country where the average income per individual is
about Rs. 40 and this includes crores of millionaires. So anyone who
1 From the Hindu, 21-5-1931150       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIlives on more than Rs. 500 lives on loot. We regard this amount as
insufficient because seeing the exploitation of the foreigners and the
life they lead, we want to copy them.
It is said that lawyers and industrialists will earn more than Rs.
500 per month. I say they should not earn more than Rs. 500 per
month.  If they do so in a country like ours they will be living on loot.
They should pay the surplus back to the country.

I am grateful for your telegram of 21st received through His
Excellency the Governor of the United Provinces then directly. I
should be . . .2 to visit London even upon this subject and explain to
responsible statesmen that whilst insisting upon making India free,
Congress wishes to live on friendliest terms with the English people.
But for reasons given to Your Excellency I am unable to take part in
the Round Table Conference. Though open to conviction, I still retain
the opinion that I could not usefully serve on the Conference unless
communal settlement is reached. Moreover, being directly responsible
for the settlement between Government and Congress I could not
leave India whilst anxious difficulties are exprienced regarding its
working. I still remain the sole representative on behalf of Congress.

DEAR FRIEND,
I have now completed my summary investigation. I have had  
the benefit of the advice of those taluqdars who were able to come   
to Nainital. I feel and perhaps you will agree that I must give some
guidance to the kisans3. I could not tell them to accept as sufficient the
relief proposed to be given by the Government. Everything I have
examined goes to show that it is wholly inade-quate to meet the
exceptional situation that faces the kisans. I propose therefore to do
the next best thing possible. In the absence of response by the
Government to any of the proposals made by me, I propose to tell the
kisans what in my opinion is the least that they should pay, throwing

205. TO THE KISANS OF THE U.P.
NAINITAL,
May 23, 1931
During the late struggle, in some districts, the non-payment of
taxes was being organized as part of Civil Disobedience for the
attainment of purna swaraj. But by reason of the Settlement between
the Congress and the Government Civil Disobedience was disconti-
nued and therefore also the non-payment of taxes.
But there was then deep economic distress among you. Bad   as
your condition was even in normal times, the unprecedented fall this
year in the prices of the crops usually grown by you made it infinitely
worse. And Congress workers reported that many of you were utterly
unable to pay in full the rents due by you. In several districts inquiries
were made in a few hundred villages disclosing a serious state of
affairs.  It was found that the price of your gross produce had fallen
to such an extent that the sales were not enough to pay the rents.  It
was in this connection that I came to Nainital to see H. E. the Gover-
nor.  His Excellency gave me a patient hearing and we fully discussed
the  situation.  He was  sympathetic. I told  him  that  some   Congress
1 Vide the following item.
2 For the addressee’s reply, vide “Letter from Sir Malcolm Hailey”, 23-5-1931154       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIworkers had assured me that the relief hitherto announced by the
Government of the U.P. was hardly equal to the actual distress.   And I
submitted certain proposals which he kindly promised to consider.
I was bound meanwhile to tender you such advice as it was in
my power to do.  I have passed many an anxious hour discussing the
situation with many co-workers.  I have had the benefit of a frank and
free discussion with important talukdars who were good enough to
respond to my invitation to see me.  I am gald to be able to say that
they were in general agreement with the proposals suggested here
under.
Concentrated work was done in the following among other
districts: Agra, Muttra, Allahabad, Rai Bareily, Gorakhpore, Cawnpore,
Lucknow, Pratapgarh, and Etawah. And for these it has been found
that there should be a remission for the year 1338 Fasli of eight annas
in the rupee in the case of statutory and non-occupancy tenants and
four annas in the case of occupancy tenants. This general formula
should be subject to variation as may be required by local conditions.
I have been told that in some districts the tenants are in a
position to do with less reduction. Some districts again were hard hit
by local calamities. The suggested reduction would naturally therefore
not apply to the districts that might be able to pay more than what is
suggested here, nor to those whose condition may be under the level
found in the foregoing districts. Indeed even in the districts menti-
oned those of you who are able to pay more ought to do so. The
Congress expects every tenant to pay as early as possible all the rent
he can, and in no case as a general rule less than eight annas or four1
annas as the case may be. But just as even in the same district there
may be cases in which a larger payment is possible, it is equally
possible that there may be cases in which less than eight annas or four2
annas can only be  paid.   In such cases I hope the tenants will be
treated liberally by  the zamindars.
In every case you will see that you get against payment a full
discharge from your obligation for the current year’s rent.
I understand that several tenants were ejected during the struggle
and others have been ejected since. Not to restore these to their hold-
ings would be clearly against the atmosphere sought to be created by
the Settlement.  I have every hope, therefore, that against payment on

without any penalty.
I am hoping that payment will begin at once. It may be that you
are not able to pay the full eight annas at once. In that case I trust you
will get suspension, and that no coercive processes will be issued whe-
ther for the unpaid balance or for arrears if any, till the next harvest.
I would like to suggest to the Government, in view of the loss
that your inability to pay the rents in full will cause to the zamindars,
that they get a proportionate reduction in the revenue payable by
them to the Government.
Lastly let me warn you against listening to the advice, if it has
reached you, that you have no need to pay the zamindars any rent at
all.  I hope that you will not listen to such advice, no matter who gives
it. Congressmen cannot, we do not seek to injure the zamindars. We
aim not at destruction of property. We aim only at its lawful use.
It has been suggested that you will listen to the Congress when
Congressmen tell you not to pay anything at all, but you will not listen
to the Congress when it asks you to pay according to your ability.  
The opportunity has now come for you to falsify the calumny.
You have complained of very harsh treatment by or on behalf
of some landlords. The Congress is trying and will try to investigate
all your complaints, plead with the landlords and even addvise legal
relief where such becomes imperative. But let it be also owned that
sometimes some kisans too have gone astray and committed mur-
derous assaults. These acts spoil the fair name of   kisans, harm their
cause and impair the usefulness of the Congress for service.  For in
the ultimate end you are the Congress. The Congress is incomplete in
so far as it represents you insufficiently.
Please remember that the Congress aims at reaching purna  
swaraj through Truth and Non-violence. And it will fail in so far as the
kisans fail to observe these two cardinal principles. You are milli-ons.  
When millions become untruthful and violent, it will mean self-
destruction.   You will therefore suffer injury without retaliation.   You
have now perhaps learnt that the best way of resisting injury is never
to injure the injurer,  but ever to refuse, no matter how much suffering
the refusal costs us, to do his will when we know it to be wrong.

May   23, 1931
DEAR   MR.   HAILEY,
With reference to the Etawah case wherein the Congress Secre-
tary was supposed to have circulated after the date of the Settlement
notice amongst tenants advising them not to pay any rent at all I have
made full inquiry and find that such notice was circulated in February
last, but none after the Settlement. On the contrary a general notice
withdrawing the notax agitation was circulated throughout the
province on behalf of the Provincial Congress Committee. This matter
was brought to the notice of Pt. Govind Ballabh Pant by the Chief
Secretary and on the day that he received the intimation he made
inquiries. The Secretary, Babu Gaya Prasad, immediately wrote in
reply giving the information above mentioned.  Moreover he is no
longer occupying position of General Secretary of the Local
Committee in Etawah. It would be perhaps interesting to know how
the police came by the notice and came to the conclusion that it was
being circulated after the date of the Settlement.1

The Congress will stand by you certainly.   But you will have to
make your life correspond to your surroundings.   In Bengal some
years ago I was the guest of a zamindar who served me my milk and
fruit in gold bowls and plates. The good host naturally thought that he
was doing me the greatest honour by placing before me his costliest
plate He could not know what was passing through my mind. ‘Where
did he get these golden plates from?’  I was asking to myself, and the
answer I got was:‘From the substance of the ryots’. How then could I

[After May   23, 1931  ]2
MY   DEAR   BROTHER,
I had your touching cable. I have sent you a reply to soothe      
you.  I am not shirking the R.T.C. But it is not possible through a
letter togive you an idea of the difficulties that face me. Provincial
governments are trampling the Settlement under foot. Repression is
raising its spiked head.  If you have the patience to follow the pages
of Young India  you can learn something of what I mean. I have pub-
lished as yet not one tenth of what is happening. The question then
may be: Can I leave India when trouble is brewing here?   But I am in
touch with Simla.

209.   NOTES
REGARDING   PICKETING
I extract the following questions from two letters :
1.Can fasting be resorted to while picketing those who break the seals of
cloth which has been sealed?
2.Does fasting have a place in peaceful picketing?
3.If those against whom peaceful picketing is being carried on do not
listen to reason, can social boycott be practised against them?
4.Can picketing be called off if a person promises not to import fresh
foreign cloth and his old stock has already been sold out?
1 Vide   “Speech at Benares Hindu University”, 6-2-1916
2 Vide   “Cable   to v. S. Srinivasa Sastri”, 23-5-1931158       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI5.Should there be picketing against those who sell both foreign and
Indian cloth?
6.Should we boycott those who have sealed up their stock of foreign cloth
and promised to pay a certain fine if they break the seal?   Shold we sit a
dharna1   before them?
The answers to these questions would be as follows :
1.Fasting can be resorted to only in regard to those who are
closely associated with the person picketing, who have given a pledge
out of the love resulting from that relationship and then broken it.
2.The reply to this is contained in the rule mentioned above.
3.Social boycott, which would imply denying the individual
the services of the dhobi, the barber, the vaid, etc., should not be
practised. But one is permitted to cut off relationship with such
individuals by way of going to their homes for feasts on occasions
such as marriages, and indeed one should do so. In short, they should
not be harassed.  The pain which they feel when we do not go to their
homes for meals cannot be regarded as harassment.
4.It is our dharma to withdraw picketing if we are sure about
the pledge.
5.Certainly.
6.We cannot resort to picketing if someone does not pay the
fine, but we can do so if he sells foreign goods.With regard toboycott,
refer to reply No.  42. Dharna does not mean self-torture to press
one’s point.
ONE ADVANTAGE  OF BOYCOTT
I take the follwing extract3   from letters received by me:
I hope that these women have given up foreign cloth and started
wearing khadi. Whether they have started doing so or not, the basic
fact is that they have learnt simplicity along with the boycott of
foreign goods. Everyone has got the experience that our craving for
enjoyment increases with the acceptance of foreign goods and the
idea gains ground that clothes are meant for adornment rather than
for the purpose of covering our body. Our newspapers are not yet full
of items on fashion but if we glance at English newspapers, we shall

dresses together with alluring descriptions of them.
Hence, along with the giving up of foreign cloth we also rid
ourselves of the glamour for false fashion and for this very reason
khadi though expensive becomes inexpensive.  A woman who used to
wear separate saris while she is at home, while going out, while paying
social calls, while visiting the temple, or who thus has four or five saris
for daily wear now makes do with a single khadi sari and, therefore,
easily saves a lot of money.  When a person wearing a turban made of
twelve yards of mulmul1 starts wearing a khadi cap made of half a
yard, however expensive khadi may be, he would easily save some
money.
DISHONESTY   OF   BUSINESS   MEN
An experienced gentleman makes the following compliant:2
There is nothing in this that is not well known. If business men
had thought only of the good of the country, they would never have
imported foreign cloth at all.   To a large extent, dishonesty is implicit
in all business. Merchants dealing in foreign cloth catch the eye
because their business it widespread and, like a huge serpent, it has
coiled itself around India and is gradually crushing her.  No one can
escape from that grip.   We have now become conscious of how we are
being crushed and hence we   have   started criticizing merchants deal-
ing in foreign cloth and that is only proper.This awakening provides a
remedy for the abovementioned and many other similar dishonest
practices. Picketing is the ready remedy. The true remedy lies in
reaching the villages. All such question as, for in-stance, whether a
particular cloth is Indian or foreign, whether it is made in a mill which
is boycotted or not, whether this khadi contains warp which is mill-
made or hand-made, etc., will automatically disappear when the
villagers spin yarn in their own homes, get it woven by their own
weavers and start using such khadi. And hence I tell you for the thou-
sandth time that the remedy for all deceit lies in khadi that is woven
from yarn spun by yourselves. Just as adding jaggery makes a thing
sweet, likewise, if we spin fine yarn, we get finer and cheaper khadi.

is such cloth, it deserves to be discarded as it is stained with the blood
of the poor.

AS   AT   SABARMATI ,
May   24, 1931
DEAR   MR.   EMERSON,
I have just arrived at Muttra and have to wait for the Frontier
Mail for a about five hours.   Local People have given me a version of
what   happened in a village called Bijhari near Muttra on 20th instant.  
I en-close herewith a copy of the statement they have given me. 18
men were arrested under warrant. The gravamen of the complaint
however is that the police acted far in excess of their authority.   There
is no complaint against the warrant itself.   It was perfectly   right   for
the authorities to arrest the men if in their opinion they had done
anything wrong.
I am going to Bardoli and I am likely to be there for at least two
or three days.

DEAR   MR.   EMERSON,
I enclose herewith a copy of the report2 received from Lala Duni
Chand of Ambala, who is a prominent pleader in that part of the
world. I would esteem a line from you even by wire as to whether you
propose to take any action in the matter. Duty perhaps demands that I
should take public notice of this action on the part of the Magistrate
unless it is possible for you to get some relief. If the facts are as stated
by Lala Duni Chand, the action on the part of the Magistrate denoted
by these facts is surely against the spirit of peace which it was the
prime object of the Settlement to establish.

AS   AT   SABARMATI ,
May   24, 1931
DEAR   SATIS   BABU,
I have your sad letter about Bholanath Sen1 I have read all about
the murder.  I knew that both the picture and the writing were wholly
inoffensive. But the complaint was that there was any portrait of the
Prophet printed at all. Or course it is a silly complaint but anything is
good enough to inflame the simple minded Pathan. In the face of
such tragedies I know nothing so efficacious as prayer and utter
silence when we can present no visible remedy.  If the Hindu heart can
be melted, the thing becomes easy.   But before it can melt, you and I
and perhaps thousands like us will have to give our lives and in order
that they may become a pure sacrifice, we have to endeavour to
become purer day by day, or better put, less impure day by day. 
Your description of the Bengal state of affairs is also sad.   I am today
in Muttra waiting for the Frontier Mail taking me to Surat. Most pro-
bably Subhasbabu will travel as far as Surat. I have not yet seen him.  
This is being dictated at the station. I am going to Bardoli on the
Sardar’s orders.  My destination is Borsad but when I shall be able to
go there I do not know.
Subhasbabu is with me on the train.2

I have your letter.   What young men can do is to make up their
minds to marry only widows and if they cannot secure widows in the
Pandit caste, they should travel outside if only by way of satyagraha.  
But if they are desirous of restricting themselves to their caste they
should reason with the caste elders and give them notice that they

encourage widows to remarry.

May   24, 1931
MY   DEAR   SAHNI,
I have heard that you had published a report of that inter-    
view. I must confess that I was grieved. Of course the proper  thing for
you was not to assume or receive consent either from Malaviyaji or
Anasuyabehn because it was a matter in which I alone could have
judged.  I do not think that any very great harm has been done.   But
these little mistakes repeated by so many newspapers make up a heavy
indictment and betray bad taste. These domestic conversa-tions do not
admit of reporting. They lose their weight and influence by reporting.
Anasuyabehn has also written to me about it. She is deeply grieved
and she tells me that there are many mistakes.   But I do not think that
anything is to be gained by publishing corrections. The best thing
therefore is to forget all about it and the amends you can make is not
to repeat such a mistake not only in connection with myself but in
every case.   I think the mistake will have been well   made if the point
I have made is quite clear to you.
Yours sincerely,

since we have not gone into villages? Whenever thieves trouble us, I
feel sorry about our failure to do so It seems the Punjabi vaid’s treat-

you that I had no hand in the publication. I know the writer. He is

AS   AT   SABARMATI ,

DEAR   SIR   COWASJI,
You will please forgive me for not having sent you an earlier
reply.   I returned to Bardoli only yesterday from Nainital where and
at Simla I was so overwhelmed with local work that I had no time to
frame my reply to you or to Sardar Garda. I am now sending you a
copy of my reply to Sardar Garda2 which will speak for itself. I am
sending you also a copy of his letter to me.  At best   his allegations
are vague and even these are really denied by the people. But the
complaint he could legitimately make could only be about matters
happening after his promise to restore the land.   That should be after
1 In reply to the addressee’s letter in which he had mentioned certain specific
complaints of Sardar Garda and pleaded with Gandhiji that “all kind of harassment
shall immediately stop . . . ”
2 Vide the following item.172       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthe receipt of Rao Bahadur Bhimbhai’s letter or so after the 25th
April when we had the first conversation.   If we were to take the 25th
April as the date you will see that there is only one paragraph devoted
to the happenings thereafter. It says : “On 28th April Babla people
again scared away our labourers and cartmen that came from my bet. 
So also a Rajput family on the 3rd instant. With other threats they
were told that their abodes would be burnt down together with the
inmates.”
These allegations I have carefully enquired into and I have
statements on oath made by the people concerned repudiating them.  
If, however, this investigation does not satisfy you, I am quite willing
that you should nominate someone on your behalf who would
investigate these two complaints.
As to Bhikhabhai who is said to have refused to take up his
bungalow, I understand that he denies having made the statement      
ascribed to him.   But even if he did not, how could we interfere in
such matters?
With reference to the other complaint in your letter I was
painfully surprised to find this sentence: “I desire to draw your atten-
tion to other cases of harassment of Parsis which have been brought to
my notice.” This presupposes that you have taken the harassment of
Sardar Garda for granted and you have generalized from two
incidents yet unproved an indictment, I do not know against whom,
for harassment of Parsis as a class.   As a matter of fact throughout the
last 12 years of intense political work the relations between the
Congress and the Parsis have been of the happiest character. How can
there be then any question of harassment of Parsis?   And even  if it
can be proved, should the harassment of the lady1 whose case you
have mentioned affect Sardar Garda’s promise of restoration of land
which on his own showing he bought for a song. I am however anxi-
ous to give you all the satisfaction I can that there is no desire
whatsoever on the part of Congress organizations to harass Parsis. In
the lady’s case there is an impeachment of Syt. Bharucha who has
investigated the matter.  In view of the fact that there are two contrary
allegations by two Parsis of position, I can only ask you to name some
person who would make the investigation and report to you.   Pending

AS   AT   SABARMATI ,
May 26, 1931
DEAR   SARDAR   GARDA,
I am sorry that owing to my absence from Gujarat and other
preoccupations I was not able to reply to your letter earlier. You will
notice from your complaint that except two, the other complaints refer
to times prior to your decision to restore the land to the original
owners.  With reference to the two incidents which you mention as
having happened on the 28th April and 3rd instant. I have enquired
into your allegations and the people point blank repudiate them. 
You have again mentioned some other cases before the 25th April
which are before the courts. The rest I have enquired into.   Although
they are alleged to have happened before the 25th April, the alle-
gations are denied by the people concerned. Of course you do not
hold Congressmen responsible for things that may happen to your
land in the Baroda territories through your tenants with whom Con-
gressmen have no dealings of concern.
As a matter of fact it was up to you to have withdrawn the       
cases which are before the courts after the settlement with you. I
cannot help therefore saying that you have shown absolutely no
reason for going back upon your plighted word. In any case  I
suggest that your proper course was to seek redress for any wrong
done to   you  after your  promise of  restoration  by means  of arbi-
tration or other-wise but not to repudiate the promise made after the
fullest deliberation.

May 26, 1931
MY   DEAR   GOPALA   MENON,
I have your letter.   I know all about the case of M.P. Narayana
Menon. I had a letter addressed to Lord Irwin by some missionary
friend given to me to be delivered to Lord Irwin which I gladly did
and asked him to endeavour to secure Narayana Menon’s release. I
have no doubt about the justice of the case.   Unfortunately the talk
with Lord Irwin took place only two days before he left Delhi.   It is
highly likely therefore that he was able to do nothing. Now as you say
Sir. C. P. Ramaswami Iyer knows the case well you have to knock at
his door continually.
I cannot give you any definite opinion upon the proposed
Temple Entry Satyagraha unless I know what the other side has to say.  
The objection you have raised is certainly worthy of consideration.  
Beyond this I do not feel able to go.
Yours sincerely,

I have your letter of the 14th instant. On my way back to  
Bardoli I had to pass nearly five hours in Muttra and I saw the    
friend who was with you. What is his name Both he and I after dis-
cussion agreed that I should take no public notice of your appeal till
you were ready with the programme for making the Mahavidy-alaya
self-reliant by a definite date not distant. But I gave him a letter
addressed to the Trustees in accordance with the terms we had
discussed before.
I missed you at Muttra.

MY   DEAR   NEEDU,
I have your touching letter.   You are unnecessarily despondent.  
There is no occasion for despondency.   I could see that you will have
to support your father, mother and child. I therefore suggest your
going to Sabarmati Ashram.   Rs. 33 per month will be paid for these
dependents. You won’t have to pay anything for your boarding and
lodging at the Ashram.   If you take to teh Ashram life your problem
is easily solved, and of course you serve the country by the mere fact
of your living at the Ashram for the simple reason that the whole of
the Ashram activity is national activity. If you do not know what
Ashram life is in detail you should ask Narayana Razu who lived
there, I think, for over a year. So many other men also from Andhra
Desh have off and on lived in the Ashram.

DEAR   DR.   ANSARI,
I have your telegram. I thought that you had agreed that if    
the communal question was not solved the Congress should not be
represented at the Round Table Conference. Why do you now       
agree with the suggestion made by Sastri, Andrews and Polak?1 But
whether you do or not, you have to consider my own want of confi-
dence in myself if I went without the solution. What can I ask and
what strength can I put forth in the national demand if we are a house
divided against itself?   But I have in my reply to the cable said that if
I was invited to go to London to discuss things apart from the Round
Table Conference I would gladly go if the Settlement was being
properly worked.
Have you seen the announcement made by Maulvi Mohammad
Yakub? I do not know what the papers have reported about my state-
ment about the necessity of the Sikhs joining any solution that might
be arrived at. Do you see any escape from it?
There was much left over to talk about at Simla. I am looking
forward to the 9th June when we should be able to resume the
conversations.

Although you are perhaps the oldest member of the Congress
you are proving your youthfulness now and again by favouring me
with letters.  Your latest I do not propose to publish.   The communal
question is there whether we like it or not.   And if we cannot settle it I
cannot put forth the national demand with the strength that a solution
of the communal question would give me. Do you not see this
fundamental objection to participation by the Congress in the Round
Table Conference?  If there is to be a Swaraj Constitution there has to
be a solution of the communal trouble.
I hope you are retaining the same vigour as before.

Silence Day [Before May 28]1,   1931
CHI.   NARANDAS,
I remember your asking me to write to you on silence day and
that is why I am writing this letter.   Otherwise I really have no time.
Tell the inmates of the Ashram that they should not be very
eager to receive letters from me.  I have talked and reasoned much
and what I taught I have practised as well as I could; let them assi-
milate as much as they can.   We have with us those three shields to
protect us, the Anasaktiyoga , the Bhajanavali  and the Ramayana . I
believe, and I want you all to believe, that the constant reading of these
with faith will be a greater source of strength than letters from me or
than living with me.
If the Punjabi vaid succeeds in his treatment of Jamna and
Kusum, we shall have made a discovery.   If he does indeed, we should
put Radha and Anandi, too, under his treatment.
How does Santok keep now ?
I have still not been able to find time for writing about the swa-
deshi vow.

255. TO  THE  U.P.  ZAMINDARS
In another column will be found my manifesto to the U.P.
Kisans.1 I know that H. E. the Governor does not quite like it
inasmuch as it goes beyond the relief given by the U.P. Government.  
But the advice given to the kisans in the manifesto is an honest attempt
to express their capacity for payment.  I am hoping, therefore, that if
the kisans pay according to the suggestion made in the manifesto, the
zamindars and the local Government will accept the payments in full
discharge of the kisans’ liability.   But under the land revenue system
prevalent in the U.P. the brunt will in the first instance fall upon the
zamindars. I am hoping that the Government will grant proportionate
relief to the zamindars who accept the tenants’ terms.
To the zamindars I can give my assurance that I endeavoured to
study the rural condition as much as it was possible for me to do.  
With the authoritative figures before me, it was impossible to offer
better terms.   Here are the two tables of prices :

Barley, Gram, Rice and Bajra) on the basis of 1873=100

They show that from 1915 there is 50% drop in the prices of
staples.   These prices go back to 1886.  That means that within living
memory they have never been so low as now. And if one were to go to
the level of rents in those days, the tenants would have to pay much
less than 8 as. or 12 as. as under the manifesto. It is admitted that the
condition of the tenants has at no time been prosperous during recent
years.  Indeed an inquiry made in over three hundred U.P. villages in
the eastern province shows that the price of the produce at the present
rate does not even cover the rents payable. This makes no allowance
for the cost of cultivation. I am prepared to admit that the inquiry was
not made by experts.  It therefore lacks scientific precision. But such
as it is, it is revealing enough to make one pause and think.
Mr. Hooper, once a Settlement Officer, is said to have given the
following landlords’ definition of the U.P. tenant :
One who is ready to live on one meal a day, and in native phrase to sell
his wife and children to pay the highest possible rent for his holding, who
submits to any cesses it may please his landlord to demand, and who is always
willing to work for him without payment, to give evidence for him in court
and speaking generally, to do any conceivable thing he is told.
The description is not flattering to the zamindars. But since  
Mr. Hooper’s time the zamindars’ ideas have undergone revolution.  
Many of them are sympathetic to their tenants.They try to make
common cause with them.  But the process has to be much faster than   
it has been. With the great awakening among the kisans there must      
be growing dissatisfaction with their lot, and a growing assertion of   
their rights.
I would like the zamindars to recognize the correctness of the
kisans’ positio and make a corresponding change in their own
outlook. The present crisis will be somehow tided over.   But it would
be wrong to go to sleep after it is over.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        187The zamindars would do well to take the time by the forelock.     
Let them cease to be mere rent collectors. They should become    
trustees and trusted friends of their tenants.   They should limit their  
privy purse. Let them forgo the questionable perquisites they take    
from the tenants in the shape of forced gifts on marriage and other
occasions, or nazarana on transfer of holdings from one kisan to     
another or on restoration to the same kisan after eviction for non-
payment of rent. They should give them fixity of tenure, take a lively
interest in their welfare, provide well-managed schools for their
children, night schools for adults, hospitals and dispensaries for the
sick, look after the sanitation of villages and in a variety of ways make
them feel that they, the zamindars, are their true friends  taking only a
fixed commission for their manifold services In short they must
justify their position. They should trust Congressmen.They may
themselves become Congressmen and know that the Congress is a
bridge between the people and the Government. All who have the true
welfare of the people at heart can harness the services of the Congress.
Congressmen will on their part see to it that kisans scrupul-ously fulfil
their obligations to the zamindars. I mean not necessarily the statu-
tory, but the obligations which they have themselves admitted to be
just. They must reject the doctrine that their holdings are absolu-tely
theirs to the exclusion of the zamindars. They are or should be
members of a joint family in which the zamindar is the head guarding
their rights against encroachment. Whatever the law may be, the
zamindari to be defensible must approach the conditions of a joint
family.
I like the ideal of Rama and Janaka.They owned nothing against
the people.   Everything including themselves belonged to the people.  
They lived in their midst a life not above theirs but in correspondence
with theirs.   But these may not be regarded as historical personages.  
Then let us take the example of the great Caliph Omar. Though he
was monarch of a vast realm created by his great genius and amazing
industry, he lived the life of a pauper and never considered himself
owner of the vast treasures that lay at his feet. He was a terror to those
officials who squandered people’s money in luxuries.

MAHARAJA   SAHEB   OF   MAHMUDABA D1
The untimely death of the Maharaja Saheb of Mahmudabad
removes one whose wisdom was needed at the present juncture in       
the life of the nation.   He was genuinely anxious to promote Hindu-
Muslim unity, and could be relied upon to give sound advice on    
national matters. I tender my respectful condolences to the deceased’s
family.
POISONOUS   JOURNALISM
I have before me extracts from journals containing some
gruesome things There is communal incitement, gross misrepresen-
tation and incitement to political violence bordering on murder. It is
of course easy enough for the Government to launch out prosecutions
or to pass repressive ordinances. These fail to serve the purpose
intended except very temporarily, and in no case do they convert the
writers, who often take to secret propaganda, when the open forum of
the Press is denied to them.
The real remedy is healthy public opinion that will refuse to
patronize poisonous journals. We have our journalists’ Association.  
Why should it not create a department whose business it would be to
study the various journals and find objectionable articles and bring
them to the notice of the respective editors? The function of the
department will be confined to the establishment of contact with the
offending journals and public criticism of offending articles where the
contact fails to bring about the desired reform. Freedom of the Press
is a precious privilege that no country can forgo. But if there is, as
there should be, no legislative check save that of the mildest character,
an internal check such as I have suggested should not be impossible
and ought not to be resented.
NAVAJUVAN   BHARAT   SABHA
A member of this Sabha asked me at Muttra Junction whether I
had suggested that no Congress member should be a member of that
body or vice versa  I told him that so far as I knew I had never ex-
pressed any such opinion.   He immediately announced the purport of
my reply to the young men on the platform, and said that some
Congress member had ascribed such opinion to me, that it was wrong
and that now every Congressman was free to join the Sabha as every

expressed no such opinion as was ascribed to me did not certainly
imply that all Congressmen should or were free to join the Sabha.  
Every Sabha has its own rules. And I should be sorry to find Con-
gressmen joining any of these Sabhas or for that matter any other
institution without first ascertaining the condition of membership, the
men composing it and the methods of its working. Certainly no one
can be bullied into joining an institution. The Navajuvan Bharat Sabha
will flourish if it shows a record of constructive service of the nation,
never otherwise.
RIVAL   CONGRESS   COMMITTEES
Whilst at Nainital I heard of rival Congress Committees in the
U.P. and elsewhere.   I heard too of election disputes in several places.  
This is a bad sign.   There must be something wrong in a place where
such unhealthy rivalries take place. The hunt for office in Congress
Committees is also a very ugly sign. A Congress office is or should be
an opportunity for service.   And where service is the motive, there can
be no unhealthy rivalry.   A man or a woman can easily do service
without needing, or hunting for office. Wise servants of the nation will
find it more profitable to stand out than to enter into unhealthy
competition.  Nor need one form a separate organization for the sake
of service.   Why do I, for instance, need an organization, if I want to
teach the children of my village or street, or to sweep it, or to nurse
my neighbours, to carry on khadi propaganda or to do kindred acts,
all of which promote national well-being and keep me going the
whole time?
CONGRESS   AND   COMMUNALISM
A correspondent asks whether a Congressman who openly iden-
tifies himself with communal conferences, and other communal pro-
paganda can hold any office under the Congress organization.
I do not think there is any rule prohibiting the election of any
Congressman to any office because of his communalism. But if the
Congress is to remain a purely national organization, and is to be
absolutely just to all and guardian of weak minorities, Congressmen
will never elect those who are known for their communal bias or
tendency.
Young India,   28-5-1931190       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI257.   CHRISTIAN   MISSIONS
I gladly publish the following from Rev. B. W. Tucker:1
I am in full agreement with you in your protest against the methods        
employed by Christian missions in their efforts to gain proselytes through edu-     
cation, medical services and the like.   Education when used for such purposes is       
really no education at all, but merely the perpetuation of the present substitute for
education initiated by the Government, which no honest missionary,   familiar with
educational experimentation in the lands from which he comes would tolerate for a
minute if his primary interest was education rather than   proselytizing. While not
denying the right of the sick to relief from their sufferings, it might not be altogether
unfair to presume, that it has been proselytizing zeal rather than lack of intelligence
that has caused missionary doctors to specialize in hospitals of healing to the neglect
of preventive medicine and health work.   All humanitarian work must necessarily
suffer if men are not dealt with with a single eye to their welfare and development as
personalities, and this cannot be the case when they are looked upon merely as
candidates for conversion into another social ro religious grouping.
. . . It is the spirit of the age, that one’s devotion to religion and God should
find an immediate return in increased material prosperity, which is the negation of all
spiritual religion. . . .   In fact the whole Christian community have had their
character vitiated by this sort of thing, . . .   In no walk of life can the principle be
justified that the end justifies the means, but least of all in religion where sincerity
must reign supreme.
. . . Jesus had the same passion for social solidarity that has ever characterized
Hindu religion at its best.   While he was a devout Jew, he was never a communalist,
and set his face sternly against everything, which hindered men from realizing their
universal brotherhood.   For this reason he was opposed to the nationalism of his
day, even as you have been opposed to the current tendency towards a divisive
nationalism in India. I believe that if modern Christian missions are to be true to
their Lord and Master,     they will eschew all efforts to proselytize and thus tear men
away from their social    order with the consequent lack of the sense of responsibility
for the advancement of that social order.
. . . This Government has demanded that the non-British missionary not only
remain neutral in such vital matters as the economic and political evils of this    
country, but has compelled him to give a pledge, which the Government has inter-    
preted to mean that the missionary shall actively support the Government. . .   In my  
1 Only extracts are reproduced here.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        191own case they objected even to my attending political meetings as a visitor, frankly
admitting that they had no charge of moral obloquy to make against me, but that the
Government interpretation of the pledge I had given would not allow me even this
privilege.   It is a standing indictment of the alliance of Christian missions in India
with the world’s greatest collective evil, imperialism, that they have acquiesced in
this arrangement.
It is for this reason that I am pleased that you have signified that you would
not perpetuate this evil in a swaraj government by creating any legal enactment
compelling missionaries to withdraw if they failed to give up their proselytizing
activities.   No government can afford to abridge freedom of religion in this way. . . .
While I am sympathetic with your criticism of the exclusive claim of
Christianity as the superior religion, I must protest against the implications of your
statement that the religions of India are adequate for her. . . .
I can have nothing to add to this letter.   But I must adhere to
the statement to which Rev. Tucker takes exception and which is,
“Religions of India are adequate for her.” This surely means nothing
more than that she does not need to change them.   But as the context
of the article in which the statement occurs shows, it does not mean
that the professors of the respective faiths have nothing to learn.   If
there is sympathetic contact established between the various faiths and
no evil designs suspected, each can gain a great deal from the rest.  
What is resisted is the idea of gaining converts and  that  too  not
 always  by fair and open means.

258.   PANCHAYATS
Panchayat has an ancient flavour; it is a good word. It literally
means an assembly of five elected by villagers. It represents the
system, by which the innumerable village republics of India were
governed. But the British Government, by its ruthlessly through
method of revenue collection, almost destroyed these ancient repub-
lics, which could not stand the shock of this revenue collection.  
Congressmen are now making a crude attempt to revive the system by
giving village elders civil and criminal jurisdiction.The attempt was
first made in 1921.  It failed.  It is being made again, and it will fail if192       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIit is not systematically and decently, I will not say, scientifically, tried.
It was reported to me in Nainital, that in certain places in the
U.P. even criminal cases like rape were tried by the so-called
Panchayats. I heard of some fantastic judgments pronounced by igno-
rant or interested Panchayats.   This is what comes to me from far off
Assam:
It has been ascertained that the Congress Committee at
Chaparmukh has set up a sort of rival administrative machinery
there for the trial and disposal of civil and criminal cases. 
There are a few branch offices in the neighbourhood of
Chaparmukh which dispose of similar business. At Chaparmukh
office regis-ters are being maintained for civil and criminal
cases.   It is understood that fines are imposed in criminal cases,
and decrees are passed in civil suits, and that in a few cases
attachments of property have been made or attempted in
execution of decrees.
This is all bad if it is true.  Irregular Panchayats are bound to     
fall to   pieces   under   their   own  unsupportable   weight.  I suggest
therefore the following rules for the guidance of village    workers:
1.No Panchayat should be set up without the written sanction
of a Povincial Congress Committee;
2.A Panchayat should in the first instance be elected by a
public meeting called for the purpose by beat of drum;
3.It should be recommended by the Tehsil Committee;
4.Such Panchayat should have no criminal jurisdiction;
5.It may try civil suits if the parties to them refer their
disputes to the Panchayat;
6.No one should be compelled to refer any matter to the
Panchayat;
7.No Panchayat should have any authority to impose fines,
the only sanction behind its civil decrees being its moral authority,
strict impartiality and the willing obedience of the parties concerned;
8.There should be no social or other boycott for the time
being;
9.Every Panchayat will be expected to attend to;VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        193(a)The education of boys and girls in its village;
(b)Its sanitation;
(c)Its medical needs;
(d)The upkeep and cleanliness of village wells or ponds;
(e)The uplift of and the daily wants of the so-called untouch-
ables;
10.   A Panchayat, that fails without just cause to attend to the
requirements mentioned in clause 9 within six months of its election,
or fails otherwise to retain the goodwill of the villagers, or stands self-
condemned for any other cause, appearing sufficient to the Provincial
Congress Committee, may be disbanded and another elected in its
place.
The disability to impose fines or social boycott is a necessity of
the case in the initial stages.   Social boycott in villages has been
found to be a dangerous weapon in the hands of ignorant or unscru-
pulous men.   Imposition of fines too may lead to mischief and defeat
the very end in view. Where a Panchayat is really popular and
increases its popularity by the constructive work of the kind suggested
in clause 9, it will find its judgments and authority respected by reason
of its moral prestige.   And that surely is the greatest sanction any one
can possess and of which one cannot be deprived.
Young India, 28-5-1931194       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI259.  SALT
Simla has issued the following welcome communique:
Since the conclusion of the Settlement between Lord Irwin and Mr. Gandhi, the
Government of India have been engaged in settling the details of arrangements and
regulations in various districts to give effect to clause 20 of the Settlement, which
related to the collection and manufacture of salt by local residents in villages
immediately adjoining the areas where salt could be collected or made. These deatails
in all cases are now practically completed, and the general manner in which effect is
to be given to the arrangement may be stated as follows:
1.Clause 20 is intended to benefit the poor classes. It will be open,
therefore, to those in villages adjoining the salt areas to make or collect salt for
domestic use and sale in their respective villages.
NOTE:  Domestic use shall include use for manure, cattle or fishcuring by
individual fishermen.
2.For this purpose villagers may make salt pans or beds.
3.There should be no sale of salt for purpose of trade outside the villages.
It follows, therefore, that such salt an be carried only on foot and not in carts or such
other conveyances.
4.Wherever manufacture of salt under the foregoing clauses is permitted,
salt pans will not be directed or otherwise interfered with by Government officers, and
regular watches will be withdrawn.
5.The concession will be withdrawn from the villages where it is found
that it is abused.  Wherever it is discovered that salt is manufactured or collected in
quantities above the requirements of a particular village, the abuse of the concession
will be presumed.
I hope that workers will understand and carefully explain these
instructions to the villagers, so that the limits are not overstepped.

May 28, 1931
When I was in Bombay, I wished to meet the deshsevikas.   I tried
to find time to do so, but I could not meet all of them.  Finally, the
women contented themselves with writing a letter  signed by all.  Till
today, I have not been able to write even a few lines to express myVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        195gratitude to them.  It is true that I was unnable to find time to write
while travelling, but the fact is that I  also forgot to write when I could
have done so.  I hope these women will forgive me. Some account of
the work done by the deshsevikas   did appear in the newspapers and,
as I received two or three newspapers while in prison, I could get some
idea of their work.  My heart used to dance with joy on reading about
their ceaseless service and their fearlessness.  It is my  hope that, with
the very same enthusiasm, these women will do hereafter the more
difficult constructive work and bring credit to themselves and to the
country. The world has certainly been astonished at what Indian
women have achieved in the past twelve months.  But their task does
not end there.  This is merely the beginning.

I got your letter.  If the marriage cannot be celebrated before
the end of June, you should come away just now and return afterwards
for a week for the marriage.  According to me, every day should be
treated as an auspicious day on which a marriage can be celebrated.
If, however, the marriage cannot be celebrated soon and if Father and
Mother willingly permit you to come away, you shold do so immedi-
ately. But you may stay on for the whole of June if they are likely to
feel  hurt.  You may go to Sitabadiyara, too, and stay there for some
time and do your duty to the family.  If you have to stay on, you
should write to uncle1,  Babaji and Vinoba about it and get their perm-
ission. I, on  my part, will also speak to them. You alone know all the
relevant circumstances for deciding whether you should stay on there;
you should, there-fore, do what seems best to you in the light of the
circumstancs there.
Write a strong letter to Jayaprakash in regard to the pain from
which he suffers. If you stay on there,  take an opportunity to meet
him.
Keep up some study.

Why have you asked for slivers to be sent to you from here?  Of

which dwelt in that body is immortal.  Since I knew him personally, I

It seems that the Foreword did not reach you after all.  Here is

everybody may understand them. If every reader,  having understood
these points, immediately starts acting upon as many of them as he
finds practicable, how very near would swaraj be?

Interviewed in connection with the report appearing in a Bombay paper
saying that an ugly situation was again developing in and around Bardoli, Gandhiji
declared :
I urge upon the public to disbelieve all sensational statements
and be  unruffled by them.  It is news to me that the peasants have no
intention to pay the land revenue. I do know that the peasants have
been paying to the utmost of their ability all the time and are still
paying.  I hope to be able shortly to make a public statement to show
how punctiliously correct Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and other workers
in the Civil Disobedience Movement have been in implementing the
Delhi Settlement.

BARDOLI,
May  29, 1931
DEAR  MR.  MAXWELL,
I thank you for your several letters which I hope to deal with as
fast as time permits me.  But I must make time to reply to your latest,
i.e., of the 25th instant and the previous one, i.e., of the 24th instant.
I do  not know what there can be in the prabhat pheris   to
object to.  Though  they  took  from  during  the Civil Disobedience
campaign   they were in themselves quite innocent. I do not know how
far they dis-turb the peace of citizens.  During my recent travels,  I
found them more or less in vogue in the other cities  too.  I can
understand prohibition of inflammatory songs. But I do not know that
the Government will be right in interfering with this innocent and
beautiful institution which reminds citizens of their duty towards their
Creator in early morning.
With reference to the Seva Dals the practices they go through
are not new.  They have for years been going through them without
any interference.  If there is anything specific that is objected to, I
would like it to be specified.  I am unable without further information
to endorse the suggestion that ‘these camps do not wholly reflect the
spirit of the Settlement and that they  are calculated in some degree to
delay the restoration of normal conditions and feelings’.
As to the other letter,  i.e., about liquor sales it comes upon me
with painful surprise.
If whilst liquor picketing is recognized as legitimate, the
Government counteract it through several practices even considered
illegal, and contend that such practices are not in contravention of the
Settlement, I venture to suggest that nothing that the Government may
do or may not do need be deemed to be in contravention of it.
But your letter tells me that the present practice of sale out of
ordinary hours and outside ordinary places of sale is perfectly legal.
This I must confess is a revelation for which I was wholly unprepared.
It means that the Collectors are guided by no legal restrictions or
regulations that the public need know. Indeed if such is the condition
of liquor law or rather if the sale of liquor is governed by no law save
the will of Collectors,  the sooner the public is informed of the fact the200       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIbetter for it. And it will be a serious matter for the Congress Working
Committee to consider.
His Excellency will permit me to say that he is evidently
unaware of the fact that picketing in Ahmedabad has been accepted
by the previous District Officer and the Superintendent of Police as
the most peaceful and inoffensive.  His Excellency is also evidently
unaware of the fact that the picketing was started by the Labour Union
in the interest of labour long before the Civil Disobedience campaign
was inaugurated.  It has been admired by strangers from the West who
have visited Ahmedabad.
His Excellency will pardon me for saying that the opening of     
the last paragraph of your letter betrays amazing ignorance of the   
working  of  picketing  in  Ahmedabad.  I  state  here for his inform-
ation that the Labour Union including the drinkers are thankful for
this watch and it is the Union that has borne the expenses.  It was
surely His Excellency’s duty to be sure of his facts on which
undeserved reflections upon the conduct of an honourable body of
men and women are based.
The suggestion contained in the last sentence that such picketing
cannot be peaceful implies a reflection on Lord Irwin who negotiated
the Settlement which reflection I am sure His Excellency could never
have intended.
In conclusion I repeat my humble opinion that if the practice of
liquor sales now going on in Ahmedabad continues, the continuation
will be in breach of the spirit if not the letter of the Settlement.
I  am,
Yours  sincerely,
M.  K.  G ANDHI

CHI.  NARANDAS,
I sent yesterday an article1 for Navajivan   on the swadeshi vow.
It will be one of the discourses on the Ashram vows, that is, the
discourses included in the series Mangalprabhat.   With this is a letter
for Dahibehn Sonabhai.  She was a member of the Stri Swaraj Sangh,

may not, therefore, be in Udwada.  Send the letter to her, wherever she
is.

about handwriting.  If you can find it, send it to me.  I am not
enclosing Dahibehn’s letter.  She is at Udwada.

I had your letter, but have so far never had time to answer it. I
came to know afterwards that the two of you had come to the station
at Moradabad to see me. But I was then asleep.
It will be good if Kanta can be admitted to Dakshinamurti. It
will also be good if she studies at home and sits for the examination of
the Karve Institute.

BARDOLI,
May  30, 1931
DEAR  MR.  KOTHAWALA,
I now send herewith a note on allegations against Patel Jehangir     
of Varad.  If an impartial open inquiry is held, full evidence will       
be led before the tribunal in support of all the allegations.  There     
is no objection on the part of the people to the inquiry being entirely
open.
Moreover, according to my information, Patel Jehangir holds    
a liquor license which, in my opinion, should be an effective bar    
against the holding of a Patelship.  As the allegations made against    
this Patel are serious and as complaints about his high-handed     
treatment of the villagers continue to come in I request an early      
public investigation or an early removal from the office he holds.       
I must add that the question of undesirability is raised without       
prejudice to the general question, namely, that the temporary
appointments, no matter of what duration, are, in my opinion, only
temporary in terms of the Settlement and in no sense permanent,VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        205especially when it is known that these appointments are for so many
years or until further orders.

I have learnt about the Dhrol1 incident.  My own view is that you
should now forget all about the demand for the national flag.  If you
like, two or three of you may come to see me.  It seems to me that
many things are being done in haste.  On your side, the right course at
present is to apply yourselves exclusively  to the boycott of foreign
cloth through propagation of khadi, and to the campaign against
drinking.  Besides, there is no dearth of social reforms which need to
be brought about.
Take every step after careful thought.

CHI.  PANDITJI,
I got your letter.
As for the boys and girls living in the Ashram who have joined
the Vidyapith, I have already communicated my views to Kaka.
Briefly, they are as follows : Though there is not much to justify the
view that the students who had joined the movement should not return
to the Ashram I would not oppose it either.  The question is, what can
they do if they cannot work elsewhere? Ordinarily, the Vidyapith
would be the only choice.  But we got alarmed when others, too,
began to give up manual work and go away.  It may also have
happened that, under the pretext of excercising self-control and not
returning to the Ashram, the students satisfied their desire for joining
the Vidyapith.  But we cannot hold back a flood.  So I let the students
do what they liked.  There is a long history behind all this.  It is
difficult to say how far the students’ action is inspired by their desire
to join the Vidyapith and how far by a clear sense of duty.  Ask me if

Why do you feel so unhappy?  After all, no great tragedy has
struck you down.  There is no law that no one shall die young.
Moreover, you and I have not one child, but countless children.  Some
of them will die and others will be born to take their place.  Why, then,
keep count of who dies and who lives?  We should do our best to serve
those who happen to be near us.  It will then be the same to us that
someone lives and another dies.
If the secretary has made the necessary arrangements, we need
not think about the matter any further.
Cultivate non-attachment.

286.  THE  LAW  OF  SWADESHI3
Swadeshi is the law of laws enjoined by the present age.  Spiri-
tual laws,  like Nature’s laws need no  enacting; they are selfacting.
But through ignorance or other causes man often neglects or disobeys
them.  It is then vows are needed to steady one’s course.  A man who
is by temperament a vegetarian needs no vow to strengthen his
vegetarianism.  For, the sight of animal food, instead of tempting him
would only excite his disgust.  The law of swadeshi is ingained in the
basic nature of man but it has today sunk into oblivion.  Hence the
necessity for the vow of swadeshi.  In its ultimate and spiritual sence
swadeshi stands for the final emancipation of the human soul from its
1 Correspondent  of Chicago  Tribune
2 The addressee’s telegram, to which this is a reply is dated May 30.
3 The Gujarati original of this appeared in Navajivan,  31-5-1931.  This is a
translation by Pyarelal.210       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIearthly bondage.  For, this earthly tabernacle is not its natural or
permanent abode,  it is a hindrance in its onward journey,  it stands in
the way of its realizing its oneness with other lives. A votary of
swadeshi therefore, in his striving to identify himself with the entire
creation seeks to be emancipated from the bondage of the physical
body.
If this interpretation of swadeshi be correct then if follows that
its votary will as a first duty dedicate himself to the service of his
immediate neighbours.  This involves exclusion or even sacrifice of
the interests of the rest but the exclusion or the sacrifice would be
apparent only.  Pure service of one’s neighbours can never, from its
very nature result in disservice to those who are remotely situated,
rather the contrary.   ‘As with the individual so with  the universe’ is
an unfailing principle which we would do well to lay to heart.  On the
other hand a man who allows himself to be lured by ‘the distant
scene’ and runs to the ends of the earth for service, is not only foiled
in his ambition but fails in his duty towards his neighbours also.  Take
a concrete instance.  In the particular place where I live I have certain
persons as my neighbours, some relations and dependents.  Naturally,
they all feel, as  they have a right to, that they have a claim on me and
look to me for help and support.  Suppose now I leave them all at
once and set out to serve people in a distant place.  My decision would
throw my little world of neighbours and dependents out of gear while
my gratuitous knight-errantry would more likely than not disturb the
atmosphere in the new place.Thus a culpable neglect of my immediate
neighbours and an unintended disservice to the people whom I wish to
serve would be the first fruits of my violation of the principles of
swadeshi.
It is not difficult to multiply such instances.  That is why the
Gita  says: “It is better to die performing one’s duty or swadharma ,
but para-dharma,  or another’s duty, is fraught with danger.”1  Inter-
preted in terms of one’s physical environment this gives us the law  of
swadeshi.  What the Gita  says with regard to swadharma   equally
applies to swadeshi also, for swadeshi is  swadharma   applied to one’s
immediate environment.
It is only when the doctrine of swadeshi is wrongly understood
that mischief results, e.g., it would be a travesty of the doctrine of
swadeshi, it to coddle my family I set about grabbing money by all
1 III. 35VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        211means fair or foul.  The law of swadeshi requires me no more than to
discharge my legitimate obligations towards my family by just means,
and the attempt to do so will reveal to me the Universal Code of
Conduct.  The practice of swadeshi can never  do harm to anyone and
if it does it is not swadharma   but egotism that moves me.
There may come occasions when a votary of swadeshi may be
called upon to sacrifice his family at the altar of universal service.
Such an act of willing immolation will then constitute the highest
service rendered to the family. “Whosoever wants to save his life will
lose it, and whosoever loses his life for the Lord’s sake will find it,”
holds good for the family group no less than the individual.  Take
another instance .  Supposing there is an outbreak of the plague in my
village and in trying to serve the victims of the epidemic I, my wife
and children and all the rest of my family  are wiped out of existence,
then in inducing those dearest and nearest to join me I will not have
acted as the destroyer of my family but on the contrary as its truest
friend.  In swadeshi there is no room for selfishness,  or  if  there is
selfishness in it,  it is of the highest type which is not different from
the highest altruism. Swadeshi in its purest form is the acme of
universal service.
It was by following this line of argument that I hit upon khadi as
a necessary and the most important corollary of the principle of
swadeshi in its application to society.‘What is the kind of service,’ I
asked myself, ‘that the teeming millions of India most need at the
present time, that can be easily understood and appreciated by all, that
is easy to perform and will at the same time enable the crores of our
semi-starved countrymen to live, and the reply came that it is the
universalization of khadi or the spinning wheel alone that can fulfil
these conditions.
Let no one suppose that the practice of swadeshi  through khadi
would harm the foreign mill-owners.  A thief who is weaned from his
vice or is made to return the property that he has stolen  is not harmed
thereby, on the contrary he is the gainer consciously in the one case,
un-consciously in the other.  Similarly if all the opium addicts or the
drunkards in the world were to shake themselves free from their vice,
the canteen keepers or the opium vendors who would be deprived of
their customers could not be said to be losers. They would be the
gainers in the truest sense of the word.  The elimination of the ‘wages
of sin’ is never a loss either to the individual concerned or to society;212       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIit is pure gain.
It is the greatest delusion to suppose that the duty of swadeshi
begins and ends with merely spinning so much yarn anyhow and
wearing khadi made from it.  Khadi is the first indispensable step
towards the discharge of swadeshi dharma twoards society.  One often
meets men who wear khadi but in all other things indulge their taste
for foreign manufactures with a vengeance.  Such men  cannot be said
to be practising swadeshi. They are simply following the fashion.  A
votary of swadeshi will carefully study his environment and try to help
his neighbours  wherever possible by giving preference to local
manufactures even if they are of an inferior grade or dearer in price
than things manufactured else-where.  He will try to remedy their
defects but will not give them up because of their defects and take to
foreign manufactures.
But even swadeshi like any other good thing can be ridden to
death if  it  is made a fetish.  That is a danger that must be guarded
against. To  reject foreign manufactures merely because they are
foreign and to go on wasting notional time and money to promote
manufactures in one’s country for which it is not  suited wuld be
criminal folly and a negation of the swadeshi spirit.  A true  votary  of
swadeshi  will never harbour ill-will  towards  the  oreigner, he  will not
be  moved  by antagonism towards anybody on earth.  Swadeshism is
not a cult of hatred.  It is a doctrine of selfless service that has its roots
in the purest ahimsa, i.e., love.

287.  LIMITS  TO  FREEDOM
Some Digambar1  Jains have asked the Sardar how, in the face of
the Congress resolution passed at Karachi regarding fundamental
rights and duties, assuring religious freedom under swaraj, anyone can
object to Digambar Jain sadhus roaming about naked  in accordance
with their religion. The Sardar had replied that religious freedom
could not imply that an act which appeared indecent to many or hurts
their feelings was permissible. And he had said it was his opinion that
despite being sadhus, if they went about naked, it was bound to hurt
people’s feelings.
I feel that the Sardar could have possibly given no other reply.
I myself believe that the ideal state for all human beings is nakedness.
1 Literally, those who regard the sky as their garmentVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        213But an ideal human being would always be innocent and free of
passions or desires.  Without such innocence, anyone roaming about
naked would be regarded as a sinful man.
There is no reason to conclude that because Digambar sadhus
are known as sadhus they would necessarily be free of all passions.
Even if they are so, it is their dharma to keep within the bounds of
social decency.  A few Jains may understand the state of these  sadhus.
But society by and large will fail to comprehend it and its feelings will
be hurt.  These naked sadhus have no need to visit cities.  It they have,
they should observe the minimum bounds of decency prescribed for
citizens.  Instead of doing that if they  insist upon entering cities in a
naked state, or if the shravakas1 insist upon this, in my opinion it
would be regarded as adharma2.  I myself am fond of the state of
nakedness.  If I were living in a lonely forest I would remain in that
state, but in this world full of passions, there is little likelihood of this
becoming the commonly accepted practice.  For the preservation of
morality even great men  of every persuasion have to cover their pri-
vate parts; it is  their  dharma to do so.  Freedom, both individual and
religious, has always had and will always have many limits.  Religion
does not hanker after rights, it hungers for restraints and restrictions.
Anyone who knows religion and practises it does not think in terms of
his rights.  Nudity cannot be one’s duty.  It is one’s duty to abandon
all possessions. That is a  dharma of the mind.  If anyone puts any
burden on me, that is not possession.  But is becomes so if I start
enjoying that burden. The sadhu who bears the burden of the loin-
cloth for the preservation of the social order does not violate the
principle of non-possession but rather exercises selfcontrol.The sadhu
who insists upon going about naked without worrying about the
feelings of society is self-willed. The following dictum of the Gita  is
pertinent in this context: “For me there is naught to do in the three
worlds, yet I am ever in action. If I were  not to perform my task, these
worlds would be ruined; I should be the cause of chaos and of the end
of all mankind.”3 Sadhus should not do anything which would harm
the people.  Let society never encourage them to do so.

DISTINGUISHING  SWADESHI  FROM  FOREIGN  GOODS
The following question1 has been received regarding this
subject:
No royal road has been found for distinguishing foreign from
swadeshi cloth. A picketer should acquaint himself well with this
distinction. And hence the general advice is that no one should
purchase from uncertified shops.  These certificates are of two kinds:
Those issued by the All-India Spinners’ Association in regard to
khadi and those issued by the Swadeshi Sabha in respect of cloth
manufactured by Indian textile mills.  I do not know if this second
type of certificate has yet been issued. But  khadi exclusively is the
simpler way out.  Where falsehood has become  almost universal, the
sentiment for khadi alone will stand the people in good stead.
Untruth has entered even the domain of  khadi, or, in other words,
deceit is being practised with regard to it also; yet there is minimum
room for deceit in it.  Moreover, those who spin at home have nothing
to fear.
Then the question will arise as to what a picketing sevika2 should
do.  If she shares my faith in khadi, she would regard picketing as a
means for carrying on propaganda for khadi and, while turning the
customers away from shops selling foreign cloth, she would direct
them towards those selling khadi.  If the latter do not take this course,
she will remain patient and have faith that there is no other way to
boycott foreign cloth.  And even if there is one, it is futile; moreover,
it is also well worth remembering that there is no special merit in
boycotting foreign cloth.  Such boycott is both useful and necessary
for khadi propaganda.  The woman picket who realizes this basic truth
will not be insulted—because she will not feel insulted—or perplexed.
She has somehow to carry on khadi propaganda for the sake of the
poor.  Other activities involve fear, insult, dishonesty and result in no
benefit to the poor.
BUYER’S  OBSTINACY3
The answer to this question should be regarded as having been
1 Not translated here

3 This was in reply to a question how to satisfy a customer who insisted on a
particular kind of khadi only.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        215included in the above. If the customer is obstinate, we should be a
hundredfold so.  The customer’s obstinacy has no ground, ours has a
strong one.  “The khadi that he wants” cannot mean that he should
get khadi as soft as satin made in Paris at the very same price.
Anyone who wears khadi has no other alternative but to wear khadi
whether coarse of fine.  We should remember that we cannot satisfy all
people.  It is not our job to satisfy everyone; rather, everybody should
suit himself to the needs of the poor, that is, be satisfied.  Khadi alone
is the refuge of the affcted.  We should be patient even with those who
disregard it.
SUCH  PICKETS  ARE  TOO  FEW1
If the number of women pickets is five and there are five
hundred shops, let them deal with only five shops or even with only
one. Propaganda for khadi is a matter of dharma and not policy.
Hence regardless of whether there is only one picket or many, that
dharma must be performed. It will be good even if only one
shopkeeper relents. It is not as if in this matter an individual
shopkeeper did not have to act till all shopkeepers acted and gave up
selling foreign cloth. Even if only one gives up, the five women
should continue picketing, thinking that the work has progressed to
that extent.  Seeing them picketing, other women will come forward.
If their picketing produces an effect on one merchant, there is a
likelihood of its having an effect on the others also.  If this does not
hap-pen, the merchant who relented will have no cause for regret.  If
trading in foreign cloth is a sin, although others may continue to be
sinful he who has realized that this practice is sinful will give it  up.  It
has always been thus.  If I had waited for everyone, propaganda for
khadi could never have been done.  A Herculean task calls for
Herculean courage.
“It is because of his courage that Columbus discovered a new
world,” says a poet.  But Columbus’s courage was exhibited for his
own pleasure.  It was not intended to serve anyone.  Underlying it was
his desire to discover a new world and to amass the wealth to be found
in it.  In order to do so, he navigated the seas; then how much more
courage shold we show in order to cloth the crores of naked people of
1 This was written in reply to a correspondent who had observed that picketing
was going to prove infructuous from the practical point of view.216       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIndia?  The sevika  who shares Columbus’s  faith and has his patience
will continue her work even if she is alone.  Day by day she will gain
new strength and new faith, and will think of new ways of doing her
work or, the “Kindly Light” will point out new paths to her.
Meanwhile, she would sing:
“One step enough for me.”
POOR  MAN1
This question implies disparagement of khadi or one may say it
implies ignorance of the importance of khadi. Has it been raised
because it is supposed that producing khadi is an easy job or one for
which only a few persons are needed?  Khadi work is a great science
which has so far been imperfectly studied.  Let as many people,
young and old, as may wish, take up this work; there cannot be too
many of them.  How many men will be required in order to meet the
needs of seven hundred thousand villages?  Khadi work is so vast that
even if a hundred thousand men give eight hours a day to it, some
work will still remain undone.  In this very issue, there is a brief
account of the production and sale of khadi in Gujarat alone.  A
glance at this should give everyone an idea of how many men are
required for khadi work.
But I am aware that there is another question behind the above
questio, viz, khadi work is all very well, but if a man finds it
uninteresting, what should he do?  Such men should remove the   
filth   in  villages;   they   should   insted  of   making   speeches  for
that  purpose, take up a broom and clean up roads and latrines, stop       
garbage heaps from forming and spread rules of sanitation among the
people.  Although the women will do picketing, they will need much
help in doing so; that help should be given by men; if the men   are
competent enough, they should sit under trees in villages and without
any books run schools for children as also start night schools for
adults.  For anyone who is bent on serving, the field is limitless.  And
everyone should realize that, when the time for launching the struggle
comes again, the strength for it will be generated only through  such
activities.
1 This was in reply to a question whether, during the Truce period, since women
were assigned the work of boycott of foreign cloth and prohibition of liquor, men
were expected to do any other work besides producing khadi.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        217Even the violent soldiers of the world have acted in this manner
and continue to do so.  It is only the mercenary soldier who, when not
engaged in fighting, becomes a drain because he eats bread which he
has not rightfully earned.  He is therefore a nuisance as he is busy
seeking pleasures and is a burden to the earth.  We have seen from
history  that Garibaldi and his soldiers tilled the land when they were
not fighting. The Boers were farmers by profession and when the time
for fighting came, right from General Botha down to the poorest Boer,
they gave up their plough shares and showed such courage on the
battlefield that it astonished the world—this I have seen with my own
eyes. If soldiers who believe in violence preserve their fighting
strength by doing such constructive work, I cannot understand why
the non-violent soldiers of India in this age should find it difficult to
do constructive work.  Every reader should remember that a great deal
of penance and constructive work lay behind the enthusiasm which
was generated  last year.
IF  POISON  IS  MIXED  WITH  MILK?1
Just as milk in which even a drop of poison has fallen is fit to be
shunned, so, in my opinion, should we have nothing to do with a shop
selling foreign cloth along with  Indian cloth. Just as a person who
drinks pure milk at a brewer’s shop will be regarded as a drunkard, so
too a customer who buys swadeshi cloth at a shop selling foreign cloth
will be misunderstood.  Is there any dearth of shops dealing only in
swadeshi cloth?  Even if there are only a few such shops and those are
not in our neighbourhood, we should go to these wherever they are
located. For those who are picketing, the way is straightforward: they
should warn people who approach shops selling foreign cloth and
turn them away, if possible.  I have recently received even this
question whether swadeshi goods can be bought at a liquor shop if
they  are being sold there.  I didn’t  hesitate to reply immediately that
the answer was in the negative.

Mirabai has shown me your letter to her. I see several difficulties
in your coming to the Ashram. A passport is necessry and it is highly
likely that conditions will be attached to your passport.  Therefore my
advice to you is for the present to suspend the idea of coming to India
to settle down with me but to follow the rules of the Ashram there and
live the life as close to the Ashram life as possible in the circum-
stances.  It is highly likely that then the way will be open for you to
come to India without  restrictions of any kind whatsoever.

I have not answered your telegram because I did not know how
to.  Now that I have got your letter I am able to answer your ques-
tions.
(1)Since picketing is to be peaceful free of all coercion,  there
is no question of insistence on sealing up the present
stock.
(2)But if a cloth merchant declines to sign your pledge it is
open to you to picket his shop even though it may contain
swadeshi cloth.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        221(3)Naturally you would picket the shop of a merchant who
breaks his pledge, but you may not impose any fine.

Here are the answers to your questions:
(1)Yes, if the purchase is made from certified producers.  But
in every case it would be advisable to make large purchases
throuh the all-India agency.
(2)I should consider A.I.S.A. certificate as necessary in every
case.
(3)Congress Committee would relentlessly enforce the khaddar
condition whilst it is part of the constitution.
(4)The relevancy of the fourth question, I do not  under-
stand,because  it  is open  to  the  Congress,  if  it  isnot obli-
gatory, to  picket  foreign-cloth  shops  provided  of course
that  picketing  is  absolutely  peaceful  and free of all coer-
cion direct  or  indirect.

MY  DEAR  FRIEND,
You  are  fishing for  a  compliment  but  I  am  not  going  to
give   it   to   you   if  only  because  it  would  be  a  repetition  of
what    I have told  you  before.  But you  are  quite  right  in thinking
that  I do not  read   newspapers.  Even   the  local  ones  I  read  for  a
few  minutes  and that too  grudgingly.  Leading   articles,  as  a   rule,
escape me.  You did  well   therefore   in   sending  me  the  Leader
cutting.  Aninoffensive paragraph in Navajivan   by Mahadev Desai
has been made much of.  I can only give you my assurance that I am
not going lightly to declare war.  I know what it would mean to Lord
Irwin.  The relations between us so developed during the negotiations
that the very consideration that a declaration of war would hurt Irwin
to the quick would alone make me wait a thousand times before
embarking on any such step.  But I can tell you in confidence that
many occasions have arisen when,  if I was so minded,1  I might have
broken up negotiaions with local authorities.  But I have exercised and
am still exercising immense patience.  In any case I am not going to
take any step without giving an ample opportunity to the Viceroy to
review the situation and taking the public into confidence.  It goes
without saying that I would do nothing without first getting the
sanction of the Working Committee.
So far for the peace or war part of your fears.  The communal
question is a horse of another colour.  My position was made clear to
Lord Irwin times without  number and I made it clearer still at the
farewell interview in Bombay. He greatly sympathized with my  posi-
tion.  As you know, the Congress demand is far above what the Round
Table Conference has higherto discussed.  If we do not reach a
communal settlement, I could not make the demand with any confi-
dence in myself.  But my non-participation in the Conference need
not mean war.  Failure to arrive at a settlement cannot be debited to
the British Government though the question at all  arises because of
the present system of administraion.  But I need not carry the matter
any further.  In this matter too I am feeling my way and if I at all can,
I would certainly attend the Conference. I have come to no irrevo-
cable decision.  If the way at all opens up before me I will go to

I got your letter.  “A non- Antyaja  Hindu” does not mean a   
Bhangi, it means a Hindu who is not an antyaja.  The man I have

not recognize distinctions of caste and community and as it is     
necessary to abolish the class of Antyajas  from Hindu society, I      
realty think that it would be good if Lakshmi could be married to a
non-Antyaja.  I a certainly very glad to know that Laksmi is not eager
to get married just now.  I hope I told you bout a house near Amreli.

June  1, 1931
Interviewed by the Associated Press regarding the statement recently made by
Sir Chimanlal Setalvad in connection with Mahatma Gandhi’s attitude towards the
Round Table Conference, Mahatma Gandhi said :
You embarrass me by asking question on anything that Sir
Chimanlal Setalvad says about me.  His age and his greatness entitle
him to make statements on insufficient data and yet absolve him from
criticism from one like myself.

panic all city  .  .  .”228       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIMoreover,  whilst I am carrying on delicate negotiations, I may
not be over-communicative, but I can make a general statement that I
am not conscious of having done anything to endanger the Settlement
or in contravention of it.
Though under given circumstances, I am anxious and willing to
attend the Round Table Conference, there is nothing in the Settlement,
so far as I can read it, to make it compulsory for the Congress to take
part in the Round Table Conference, but that discussion is purely
academic, for the question of non-attendance has not arisen at all.
Asked if it was true that his attitude was undergoing constant change, Mahatma
Gandhi said :
I am not aware of having done such a thing.
Replying to a question whether he would take part in the Round Table
Conference, he said:
If I succeed in attending the Round Table Conference, I should
put forth the Congress demands with all zeal and power I may have
and fully participate in the proceeding and not be a mere spectator at
the Round Table Conference.
Questioned whether there was an impasse in Bardoli, Mahatma Gandhi said :
I have had a happy interview with the Collector along with Mr.
Vallabhbhai Patel and I am hoping that everything would be fixed up
satisfactorily.
Replying to a further question if there was any breach of the Truce terms in
Bardoli or Borsad, he stated:
I would prefer not to answer that question, because negotiations
are still going on for the settlement of outstanding questions both in
Bardoli  and Borsad.

DEAR  MR.  EMERSON,
You will recal our conversation about the Navajivan  and Young
India  press1.  I wonder if you have got legal opinion.2  Al l the
opinion that I can gather is that the clause certainly means delivery at
the place from where the property was removed.  But I shall be
interested to know what your legal advisers have got to say.
Meanwhile Young India   and Navjivan  are still labouring under a

314.  LETTER  TO  C.  F.  ANDREWS
AS  AT  SABARMATI ,
June  2, 1931
MY   DEAR  CHARLIE,
I have your two precious letters.  I see you are in a hury to have
me in England through the air mail if I would fly.  But I can hardly
hop.  I see no light before me as yet.  My desire is certainly to go
there but the inner voice says ‘no’ and the external atmosphere
confirms the guidence of the inner voice.  As you know, the Congress
demands are strung  in a high pitch.  They could not be otherwise.  If
we cannot set our  house in order here so far even as the communal
question is concerned I could not speak in London as with one voice.
It therefore does seem to me that if the communal trouble is not
finished and a workable formula is not arrived at by agreement I
should not have the requisite self-confidence to deliver the Congress
message.  That is so far as the Round Table Conference is concerned.
But of course  if the British Minister require my presence in order to
discuss the Congress position and understand it and if they would
want me to do a little lobbying also I could come whenever required.
But then there is the Delhi Settlement.  I am bound to see, as far as is
possible for  a single human being, that there is no breakdown.  The
Bombay Government has given me cause enough to re-declare
hostilities but if you knew everything you would yourself be amazed
at my patience.  In every little thing it is like drawing a live tooth.  But
I must not weary you with these troubles of mine.  I am taking them
cheerfully and breaking down opposition.  Thank God, I do receive
help from the Central Government.  I believe Mr. Emerson knows me
and he will play the game. But local governments may produce
situations which neither he nor I can control.  I can tell you that so far
as the Congress is concerned,  Congressmen are implementing the
Settlement in a manner not even expected by me.  Of course there is
overzeal now and again in picketing but it is immediately broughtVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        231under control.  You can give this assurance to all who may need it that
I am anxious to attend the Conference and try my utmost to secure
lasting peace and an honourable settlement of the constitutional
question by negotiation.  It is only external circumstances which
really detain me.  But in any case for reasons unconnected with my
hesitation the Round Table Conference and its Committees stand
postponed.  There need be therefore no hurry just now over my
coming unless of course I am required there independently of the
Conference.  I have now told you all that you should know.
I am just now in Bardoli fixing up things.
Gurudev seems to be ailing.
Love.

  315.  LETTER  TO  SATIS  CHANDRA  DAS  GUPTA
AS  AT  SABARMATI ,
June  2, 1931
DEAR  SATIS  BABU,
I have your letter. Subhasbabu was here and he had a
formidable list of countercharges. I have now telegraphed to both ask-
ing them to submit to arbitration by mutual consent, and if they will
appoint some local men as arbitrators and abide by their decision,  this
unseemly squabble might end.  In any case I am going to try whatever
is possible on the 9th.
You are having success with the Gita  and the Autobiography.   I
did not expect you would have any sale for these books.
I am glad you have gained in weight but you have to gain much
more.  And I am certain that you should not stint yourself about food
that your system may require. It is quite enough that  you deny your-
self flesh and fish.  You ought to take milk and curds liberally and
take such fresh fruit as is easily available.  I have written similarly to
Hemprabha also.  She is wrong in denying herself food that her body
requires because Nikhil1  is no more.  I feel more and more that this
kind of self-denial not only carries no merit but is a violation of
nature’s laws.  Denial of food has merit when it is undertaken for
control of the palate or as a medical necessity.
1 Addressee’s son; he had died in 1928.232       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIKishorelal Mashruwala raises a doubt as to the authenticity of
the spinner’s letter of 1828 whose translation you sent me the other
day and which I published in Young India.1  He thinks that the langu-
age is much too modern, as also the conception. If I  understood your
letter rightly, you had mentioned that the copy of the newspaper in
which the letter appears is in your possession.
Love.

DEAR  FRIEND,
I thank you for your letter.  Whilst I have a very vivid recollec-
tion of your personal services3 to me I have long ceased even to think
of rewarding such services materially. I have rendered myself practi-
cally incapable of rendering such services. The only service therefore
I have for years rendered for them has been heartfelt thanks, and
heartfelt thanks of a poor man like me take the shape of blessings.  I
must confess that I have been the recipient of personal kindnesses

DEAR  SIR  COWASJI,
I thank you for your prompt acknowledgement of my letter1
and the trouble you are still taking with reference to the land in Sardar
Garda’s possesion.  It seems to me that he is legally bound to transfer
the property having written the letter concluding the bargin. I have
written to him to that effect2  in reply to his letter. I have been making

2 Vide  “Letter to Framroze B. Garda”, 26-5-1931234       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIfurther enquiries and I am able to give you my assurance that there is
nothing in the charges made by him.  On the contrary he is becoming
a terror to the people.  Youngsters under 12 years of age were arrested
for having helped themselves to mangoes from his land.  You do not
know the taluqa.  Mango trees are not protected and urchins all over
the land help themselves often to mangoes during the mango season  
and nobody worries about them.  I am not sure that the urchins whom
he had arrested had touched his mangoes. But even if they had, they
would be under nobody’s control. And yet he would press incidents
like this into service to make up his indictment although these inci-
dents have nothing to do with alleged harassment.
I shall await your letter regading Miss V. Contractor’s com-
plaint.

solution on the eyes.  If this remedy is likely to benefit you, you will
know it  in a day.  That is, you will find that the lustre of your eyes

328.  LETTER  TO  CHHAGANLAL  JOSHI
June 2, 1931
CHI.  CHHAGANLAL,
Surendra’s letter seems to have confused you.  He has mixed up
several issues, with the result that you could not understand my real
meaning. The idea that Surendra should return to the Ashram is
independent of other considerations, and these are the reasons for my   
view:
1.It did not seem necessary to me to keep him at Karadi.
2.It is not proper for us, who have taken the vow of
aparigraha,  to make a special effort to find out another place and
stay there.
3.In the present circumstances, it would not at all be wrong if
persons like him return to the Ashram.
4.Sardar would certainly prefer that Surendra and other work
ers like him who cannot easily adjust themselves to circumstances
should stay in the Ashram.
The following is the substance of the other po9ints discussed
along with these :
1.Those Ashram workers who were slack in observing the
Ashram rules of discipline and who were unwilling to return to the
Ashram on the pretext that they should work outside should return to
it.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        2392.It was the duty of those Ashram, workers who were
required outside the Ashram and who could observe the Ashram rules
to stay outside it and do the required work.
3.It was preferable to have only one public worker in every
village.
4.When there are more workers than one in a village, it is
likely that they will not have enough work to do and that even small
differences of opinion which may arise among them will confuse the
minds of the residents.
5.It is probable that Darbari left the place because he felt,
when he saw three or four Ashram workers there, that he no longer
enjoyed the position which he did.
6.One should run away from a place where the necessity of
one’s services is not self-evident.  Before accepting anybody’s version
of what I may have said, you should ask me.

not provide proper education But one who is required in the

end in view is fit to join it.

There is still the fire-arms question to be decided.  I do not

legal advice, I am quite certain of the conversation about this very

I have just got the complete file of Syt. Rajah’s2 case.  I am

1 Emerson replied on July 2 thatt “. . . the student cannot be regarded solely as
an individual.  He is a member of a corporate institution, and in the interests of the
institution, and not with the object of imposing any indignity on the individual, it is
often necessary to make conditions which will secure discipline. These are
considerations to which local Governments undoubtedly attach great weight, and it
may be assumed that had the question been raised twhen the Settlement was under
discussion, they would have taken strong exception to the re-admission of students
without any guarantee for the future and irrespective of the reasons for which they had
left, or been expelled from, educational institutions.  In these circumstances the
Government of India do not consider it fair to local Governments to impose on them a
course of action outside the Settlement. . .”

DEAR  FRIEND,
You are quite right in thinking that if I did not get the quiet to
read your book1 in Yeravda it was not likely that I should have any,
outside that abode of peace. The book was taken away on his
discharge by the prisoner friend who had borrowed it from me and he
returned it on my discharge when I was in the midst of interminable
work.  Since my discharge, I have not been able to rest.  The work
before me exhausts such energy as I have still left in me.
You will be welcome to the Ashram whenever you come.
Yours sincerely,

mentioned by him, i.e., Rs. 33 per month, for his dependents.2  But if
you can guide him there and he will accept your guidance do please

DEAR  FRIEND,
Whatever energy I possess is due to regular habits and  such     
self-restraint as I am capable of exercising.  It is quite true that friends
around me too notice my peace of mind.  It is an object of envy.  It
comes from absolute faith in God and His goodness. That faith ena-
bles me humbly to do the task allotted to me without being anxious
for  the result.
I believe that indigestion is one thing which everybody can
control and remove.  Before I can advise you on your food, it is really
necessary for me to know much more about you than you have told
me in your letter.  I should like to know what you feel when you say
you are suffering from indigestion. Are your bowels acting regularly?
How long have you suffered from indigestion? What food are you
taking now and in what quantity and how many times?  What exercises
are you taking?  How do you pass your days?

347.  LETTER TO DARCY LINDSAY
AS  AT  SABARMATI ,
June 3, 1931
DEAR  FRIEND,
I thank you for your letter of the 30th April last.  I thought that
the proposition that the Indian is a mere clerk1 in the administration of
the country was not seriously disputed by anybody.  Wish that you
could read the minds even of the Indian members of the I.C.S.  I
know from personal experience of them that the vast majority of them
do not feel anything  more than mere clerks, somewhat glorified if
you like.  But when I wrote the passage I had not the few of these
highly-paid Indians in mind but I had the army of actual clerks who,
no matter what their ability may be, can never rise beyond the status
of clerks.
When I said that the Indian at best was a commission agent I
again thought that I was stating what was literally the truth.  Take the
largest item of foreign trade.  Is not the Indian merely the agent of his
foreign principals?  If he makes five rupees for himself, he makes Rs.
95 for his principal.  So long as the conditions of trade remain what
they are it cannot be otherwise.  If India remains principally a country
exporting raw produce and importing manufactured articles, Indian
merchants must be largely commission agents whether of England,
1 Vide “The Giant and the Dwarf”, 26-3-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        249Japan, America or any other foreign country.
How shall I prove to you the daily humiliating experience of the
Indian who, no matter how wealthy he is, gets no facility whereas his
English rival gets many things done for the asking.  Take the case of
the British navigation companies, the concessions enjoyed by Euro-
peans all over India whether in mining, banking or other commercial
pursuits too numerous to mention.
When I say that the English trade is founded upon the ruin of
Indian trade, I have simply written what historians have stated.  If it
was merely enterprise and grit that had brought about the state of
things I should not grumble.  But I would like you to study the rise of
the East India Co. from the records of the India Office collected, be it
said to their honour, by English historians.
In writing of the levelling process I certainly had not in mind
the Soviet rule of Bolshevism.  It is perhaps somewhat shameful that I
have to confess to you that I do not yet know exactly what Bolshevism
is for the simple reason that I have not had time to study the inner
working of the Russian revolution. The levelling process to me simply
means that the system of favouritism on which, as I believe, English
commerce has been built should cease and for that purpose a double
process has to begin. Favouritism should go and young Indian
enterprises should receive State help and patronage.
I know that I must not expect to convert you by argument.
What I would like Englishmen in India to do is to see them [selves] as
the average Indian sees them and ask themselves why it is that the vast
majority of Indians feel as I often write in the pages of Young India .
Can it be that what some English economists have written and what
most Indian economists, historians and administrators have written is
all untrue? The case that I have presented is based upon their testi-
mony and supported by personal experience.
Lastly, however much I may differ from your views, let me
assure you that I appreciate your persistence in trying to convince me
of my error.  And if you will not give up the attempt I dare say that if
I am not converted it is possible that in the process of friendly
interchange of communications you might be able to see theother side
of the shield.

DEAR  FRIEND,
I have your letter.
I certainly think that it is everyone’s duty and especially an
educationist’s to speak the truth at all cost.
Discussion of politics in colleges should carry no stigma.
It was impossible to cover in the Delhi Agreement cases in
Indian States.
I can understand the distinction between those who resigned on
their own free will and those who were dismissed.  A dismissal may
take place on valid grounds apart from civil disobedience.
I should be astonished if it was true, that because you were
dismissed from Kashmir State service for the reasons you state, other
educational institutions will not take you up.

build up practically a new body.  And all this should be possible after
the terrible crisis which had reduced you to a shadow.

Madhya Pradesh aur Gandhiji , p. 136256       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI361.  CASTE AND COMMUNAL QUESTION
A student who sends his name writes:1
It is not quite correct to say that Hindus and Mussalmans do     
not greet one another on their respective sacred days.  But one would
certainly like much more frequent and extensive interchange of such
greetings.
As for caste I have frequently said that I do not believe in caste    
in the modern sense.  It is an excrescence and a handicap on progress.
Nor do I believe in enequalities between human beings.  We are all
absolutely equal.  But equality is of souls and not bodies.  Hence it      
is a mental state.  We need to think of and to assert equality  because   
we see great inequalities in the physical world.  We have to realize
equlity in the midst of this apparent external inequality.  Assumption
of superiority by any person over any other is a sin against God and
man. Thus caste, in so far  as  it c onnotes  distinctions  in  status, in
an evil.
I do however believe in varna which is based on hereditary
occupations.  Varnas are four to mark four universal occupations, —
imparting knowledge, defending the defenceless, carrying on agri-
culture and commerce and performing service through physical  
labour. These occupations are common to all mankind, but Hinduism,
having recognized them as the law of our being, has made use of it in
regulating social relations and conduct. Gravitation affects us all
whether one knows its existence or not.  But scientists who knew the
law have made it yield results that have startled the world.  Even so has
Hinduism startled the world by its discovery and application of the law
of varna.When Hindus were seized with inertia, abuse of varna resulted
in innumerable castes with unnecessary and harmful restrictions as to
intermarriage and interdining. The law of varna has nothing to do
with these restrictions.  People of different varnas may intermarry and
interdine.These restrictions may be necessary in the interest of chastity
and hygiene.  But a Brahmin who marries a Sudra girl or vice versa
commits no offence against the law of varna.
Marriage outside one’s religion stands on a different footing.
Even here, so long as each is free to observe his or her religion, I can
see no moral objection to such unions.  But I do not believe that these
unions can bring peace.  They may follow peace.  I can see nothing
1 The letter is not reproduced here.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        257but disaster following any attempt to advocate Hindu-Muslim unions
so long as the relations between the two remain strained. That such
unions may be happy in exceptional circumstances can be no reason
for their general advocacy. Interdining between Hindus and Mussl-
mans does take place even now on a large scale.  But that again has
not resulted in promoting peace. It is my settled conviction that
intermarriage and interdining have no bearing on communal unity.
The causes of discord are economic and political, and it is these that
have to be removed. There is intermarriage and interdining in Europe,
but the Europeans have fought amongst themselves as we Hindus and
Mussalmans have never fought in all history.  Our masses have stood
aside.
The untouchables are a class apart—a standing reproach to
Hindu-ism. The castes are a handicap, they are no sin. Untouchability
is a sin, a grievous crime, and will eat up Hinduism, if the latter does
not kill the snake in time. Untouchables’ should no longer be the
outcastes of Hin-duism. They should be regarded as honoured
members of Hindu society, and should belong to the varna for which
their occupation fits them.
According to my definition of varna there is no varna in
operation at present in Hinduism. The so-called Brahmins have ceased
to impart knowledge.  They take to various other occupations.  This is
more or less true of theother varnas.  In reality, being under foreign
domination we are all slaves, and hence less than Sudras—untouch-
ables of the West.
The correspondent being a vegetarian finds it difficult to
reconcile himself to dining with meat-eating Mussalmans.  But he
should re-member that there are many more meat-eating Hindus than
Mussalmans.  A vegetarian may with impunity dine with meat-eaters,
Hindu and others, so long as he has eatable food cleanly prepared and
placed before him.  He will always have fruit and milk whereever he
goes.

SAVE  ME  FROM  MY  ADMIRERS
A correspondent writes from far off Cape Comorin:1
. . .  In the car festivals here the Image is placed in the car and taken in
procession.  One set of people want that your photo should be placed side by
side with the Image and taken in procession.  Another set of riper men say that
you would not like to be treated as God . . .
Another from Mathura sends me a horrible portrait representing
me as lying stretched on the coil of the thousand-mouthed serpent
with the roll of non-co-operation in one hand and the spinning-wheel
suspended on the other arm.  My poor wife is massaging my legs.
The other celebrities have also been pressed into service.  I must not
violate the reader’s feelings by describing the other features.  Suffice
it to say that the picture is a caricature of the Vaishnavite legend
representing Vishnu resting on the coil of Sheshanag.The correspo-
ndent who sends the picture asks me to plead with the publishers for
its withdrawal.  He rightly adds that though they may not publicly
express their resentment, the picture must hurt the feelings of
orthodox Vaishnavas. I whole-heartedly endorse the sentiments of
both these correspondents. The motive in each case may be quite
good.But this excessive heroworship borders on questionable idolatry,
and is calculated to wound susceptibilities of the orthodox people
without there being any excuse for giving such offence.  Such
excesses will defeat the purpose of the blind worshippers.  If they have
any regard for my feelings, let the organizers of the car festival who
would put my portrait in the car and the publishers of the offending
picture desist from their activity.  There are many other healthy ways
of giving expression to and promoting patriotic sentiment.
REPATRIATES  FROM  SOUTH  AFRICA
Pandit Benarsidas Chaturvedi and Swami Bhavani Dayal
Sannyasi have prepared a well-reasoned report of an independent
enquiry they held into the condition of emigrants repatriated to India
under the assisted emigration scheme from South Africa. This report
and the Swami’s telegram dated 16th ultimo, asking me to comment
on it, telling me, “Condition worst, many starving, women half naked,
children begging”, have lain with me ever since.  I am sorry that I
have not been able to deal with the report earlier.  The telegram from
1 Only an extract is reproduced here.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        259which I have quoted is an epitome of the report.  The condition of our
people, who find themselves strangers in their own land, is a disgrace
alike to us and to the Government, but more to us than to the
Government.  No Government in the world can cope fully with such
cases.  Governments can only support to a limited extent voluntary
public effort in such cases.  It is really up to the merchant princes and
other employers of labour in Calcutta to take a real interest in the
welfare of such people, and find suitable employment for them.
But the condition of these people is a small consideration,
compared with the cause that has reduced those repatriates to the
condition in which theyfind themselves.  There should have been no
agreed repatriation at all, and if there was to be any, there should have
been ample provision previously made to ensure proper occupation
for them, and in any case there should never have been any consent to
the repatriation of colonial-born Indians, of whom there are fully
thirty-three per cent in the Calcutta depot.  But it is no use crying over
spilt milk.  The labours of the framers of the report will not have been
in vain if at the time of the revision of the Cape Agreement, the rights
of the poor labouring Indian population are not bartered away for
doubtful concessions to the other Indian settlers.  The position taken
up by the latter is unassailable, and should depend on its own merits.
The settlers themselves should therefore refuse to be party to any
bargain, which would compromise the rights of their less favourably
situated brethren.  South Africa can easily absorb and accommodate
the existing Indian population.
GANDHI  ASHRAM,  MEERUT
This Ashram, a creation of Acharya Kripalani, has issued a       
neat  little  pamphlet  describing  its  activities.  From a tiny thing
which it was  when  it  began  life   at  Benares  in 1920,  it  has  now
grown  into  a   big  thing  with   branches  and   its  own  premises  in
Meerut, the  headquarters.  It is  now a registered charitable  associa-
tion. Its  chief  activity is production and distribution of khadi, but it
runs free dispensaries and night schools wherever it is possible. Its
production of khadi in 1921 was Rs. 48 and sale Rs. 3,100. The
production in 1930 was Rs. 4,21,490 and sales Rs. 5,32,361.  The
price of its khadi 45" in width was Re. 1 per yard in 1921, and Rs. 0-
5-6 per yard in 1930. It has departments of washing, calendering, and
dyeing besides the cotton processes up to weaving.  It takes and
teaches apprentices in these departments, and finds work for the poor
women of Meerut by giving them knitting, bordering of bedsheets,260       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIetc.  Who can say that khadi has no future, or that it is not the help of
the poorest in the land?

363.  IS IT AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY?
A contribution in the Times of India (26-5-’31) has the
following:
Mahtma Gandhi, in his latest pronouncement1 concerning the purpose
and procedure of picketig, has reiterated his belief that the exclusion of
foreign cloth is an ‘economic necessity to India’.  Perhaps he will explain, in
the next issue of Young India, in what sense he uses that term.  The
information required can be supplied by answering certain questions prompted
by the piecegoods situation as it is now developing.
1.To what extent has the decline of 1,000 million yeards in the
imports of cotton piecegoods in 1930-31 been balanced by the increased
production of indigenous cloth based upon the processes of hand-spinning and
weaving?
2.To what extent has it been balanced by increase in mill
production?
3.Will the boycott be persisted in, regardless of the extent to which
imported goods are displaced by hand-made and mill-made goods respectively?
4.If so, to what extent is the boycott in the interests of Bombay as
distinct from other provinces?
Clearly, if the endeavour to revive the village industry has definitely
failed, as appears to be the case, however reluctant Mahatma Gandhi may be to
acknowledge defeat in a campaign so close to his heart, then the time has
arrived, in the interests of public honesty, to transfer the formal control of the
boycott campaign to the Cotton Millowners’ Associations, acting as
principals, instead of continuing the camouflage of control by Congress,
acting as agents.
The answers to the specific questions are:
1.It is impossible to answer the question in terms of yards
because khadi is not all commercially produced.  Home manufacture
of khadi for use by manufacturers themselves is proceeding on an
ever increasing scale, which it is impossible for the poor All-India
Spinners’ Association to measure.

important part in making good the deficit.
3.It will be, subject to what follows.
4.The interest of Bombay is the interest of India.  The writer
perhaps includes Ahmedabad in Bombay, and evidently ignores the
other important mills scattered all over India.
I have answered the specific questionsfor the satisfaction of the
writer of the article than of myself or the public.  The public should
know that I should lose all interest in boycott of foreign cloth, if I
really discovered that khadi was a failure, as the writer is sure it has
proved to be already.  I do not know the source of his assurance.  But
as the party chiefly concerned in khadi production and propaganda, I
make bold to say that it is not only not a failure but is making sure
though slow headway all over India.  I therefore do reiterate the claim
that boycott is an econo-mic necessity for the masses.  It may sound
strange, but it is true that it is not in the same sense and to the same
extent an economic necessity for the mills as for khadi.  Mills have
undoubtedly flourished beyond their expectations by reason of the
boycott, but they could have, as they were doing, eked out an
existence without the boycott.  They could always share with Britain
and  Japan the exploitation of starving millions by dumping their
manufactures among the ignorant, famishing millions, who, forgetting
that by using their leisure hours they could manufacture their own
cloth, would buy the flimsy mill calico and  thus doubly injure them-
selves.  Boycott cannot therefore be wholly transferred to the mills
even if they wanted it.  And If they undertook it, it would fail.  The
fact cannot be concealed tht the mills are interested in the boycott
chiefly for their agents’ and their share-holders’ profits.  The Con-
gress is concerned with the boycott wholly in the interest of the
masses.
The writer and, for that matter, many others do not know          
that the khadi method is a new method in economics as non-violence        
is a new method in politics. The khadi method is bound to con-        
found the orthodox economic theories, as non-violence has al-          
most already confounded the orthodox political methods.  The            
new method lends itself ot the orthodox statistical demonstration          
only to a certain extent.  It is the khadi spirit that is responsible for the
phenomenal success of the  boycott.  Boycott itself is no new cry.  It is
as old as, if not older than,  the Bengal partition period.  But he hope262       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIof success was born with the rebirth of khadi in 1919, and the hope
was partly realized last year when khadi spirit was at its highest.  The
real manifestation of the khadi spirit has still to come. And when it
does, as it is bound to come, and that too sooner than most people
expect, there will be neither picketing nor statistical demonstration
required.
The  Times of India   writer suggests tat the boycott is designed
or calculated merely to benefit the mills to the injury of the masses.
The suggestion would have foundation if there was no khadi behind
the boycott.  Let the writer and critics like him remember that the
Congress formula in so many words is ‘Boycott through Khadi’.  The
India mills come in to supplement khadi.  But the boycott would stand
in spite of the Indian mills if they opposed khadi.  Many did oppose it
at one time.  Their indiference to khadi was still more marked.  But be
it said to their credit that they have somewhat recognized the time
spirit, and even though yet half-heartedly in the majority of cases,
they have made terms with khadi. Some have become thorough
converts to  it, and will not even mind losing, if they must, for its sake.
The  Indian mills are therefore in no sense of the term principals in
the boycott campaign.  they benefit no doubt, and they will, at least
for the time being, increasingly benefit, but the ratio of increse will be
in direct proportion to the correctness of their conduct in their
dealings with khadi.
The writer, as well as the reader, will now understand why India,
that is to say, the masses must benefit in the long run even by the
recent legislative protection given to the mills.  The prices of mill
cloth must of course go up. It is for the Congress to carry on ceaseless
propaganda,  so as to keep the mills from the profiteering temptation,
and to teach the masses that their economic welfare lies in the
manufacture of khadi in their own cottages through hand-spinning.
When once foreign cloth is out  of the way, indigenous mills will
radily suit their prices and production to khadi, or will themselves face
a boycott even like foreign mills.
Young India,  4-6-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        263364. R. T. C. AND CONGRESS
Had it not been for the necessity of observing reticence for the
sake of the lasting peace, which it is the common object of all parties
to reach, I should have long ago taken the public into confidence
about my proposed visit to London to take part in the R. T. C. I am
now in a position to say the following:
I have made no secret of my opnion, not new but held and
expressed even while negotiations were going on in Delhi, that I
should feel most reluctant to go to London to take part in the
Conference, if we failed to solve the communal problem among
ourselves.  I have seen nothing as yet to  make me alter the view.
There is another obstacle in the way of my leaving India, whilst
delicate situations continue to arise regarding the Delhi Pact.  I should
sacrifice life itself to prevent a breakdown.  And I flatter myself with
the belief that my presence is necessary to prevent it.
Let us however hope that both the difficulties will be over by the
time it becomes necessary to leave India for the September meeting.
I can but give my assurance that having entered upon the
Settlement, I am eager for the sake of the good name of the Gongess
to proceed to London and deliver its message to the R. T. C. and the
British statesmen, not excluding even Mr. Churchill.  I know that he
and his party do not realize that the Congress is no enemy of Great
Britain.  The Congress merely wants for India what he and his
ancestors have fought to secure for Great Britain.  I therefore need no
persuasion to take me to London. I have even said to friends that if
the communal tangle was not undone, and I was therefore unable to
take part in the R. T. C. but the working of the Settlement left me free,
I should, if so required, proceed to London for the sake of presenting
the Congress position to the responsible statesmen.  My supreme
desire is to attain lasting peace, if it can be had with honour and
without inviting the nation to engage in another fight involving untold
suffering.
Young India,   4-6-1931264       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI365.  PRABHATPHERIS
It was in the Yeravda prison that I read of the inauguration of
prabhatpheris1. I thought that whoever originated the idea deserved
thanks for it.  I felt that apart from their propaganda value, they were
spiritually beautiful.  They summoned the sleeping to the call of duty.
They reminded them that it was time to rise to the call of duty.  They
reminded them that it was time to rise from their beds and give thanks
to God the first thing in the morning.For I had read that the memmers
of the prabhatpheris   sang songs of worship as also of topical public
events.  If wisely guided, this institutution can become a great means
of purification as also political education of the right type.  But I hear
that songs generating bad passion are also some times sung. I should
be sorry if my information proved true.  I would strongly advise the
organizers of these parties to restrict their choice of songs not only
during this time of peace but for all time to those of worship and
those dealing purely with constructive activities such  as khadi, liquor
prohibition, communal unity, untouchability and  other social reform.
The parties must be trained to sing well and  in tune and should keep
to one hour throughout India.  I remember the parties in Bombay not
always keeping the same time and in Allahabad keeping a different
time from Bombay.  The institution has sprung up anyhow, but it will
be well now for the prime  movers, if there are any, to evolve a proper
plan and publish a selection of songs which all, no matter belonging
to what faith or party, can sing.  This should be a non-party national
institution.  If parties spring up anyhow and begin singing anyhow
and any time, they would disturb the people by their jargon.  But
good singing in the morning will be appreciated.

366.  ‘AN  HONEST  DOUBT’  (?)
The now famous Gandhi-Irwin truce terms received an almost un-     
animous approbation, though not from the entire section of Congressmen  in
India, at least from a majority of them.  The people and the Press,  both in this
country as well as on the continent of Europe, expressed their  sincere appre-
ciation of the succes of the peace negotiations, and there  was a consensus of
opinion expressed, that honesty of purpose and sincerity in action on both
1 Literally,  morning  processionsVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        265sides lent sufficient weight to the success of the negotiations.  In spite of this,
there was and is still a very strong minority comprising especially the
younger generation, which is totally against the truce terms, and emphatically
declines to put its seal of approval upon them.  They are of the opinion, and
we think not without sufficient justification, that the flag of complete
independence as the immediate goal of India, hoisted at the Lahore Congress,
has been lowered by the truce terms, thereby committing the Congress and its
followers to a less severe and entirely different programme of a activities.
No one for a moment seems to doubt the sincerity of purpose with which
Gandhiji, as the one voice on behalf of the Congress, and Lord Irwin, as the
spokesman of the British Government, carried out the peace negotiations to
such a successful conclusion.  The left-wingers, under the leadership of Sjt.
Subhas Chandra Bose, had almost planned to oppose the Resolution at Karachi
Congress ratifying the Delhi Pact, but better  counsels prevailed with them,
and we are thankful to them for having averted a very serious defection in the
Congress, at a time like the present, when complete unanimity and co-
operation mean much.  With great reluctance they let Gandhiji have his own
way and try once more his faith in the British Government.
Let us for one moment examine how far the terms of the truce have been
observed since the Settlement.  Government on their part have released the
Civil Disobedience prisoners, withdrawn the various ordinances, and declared
the Congress organization a lawful body.  The Congress on their part have
called off Civil Disobedience, aggressive picketing, boycott of British goods,
etc., and have also acceded to the cancellation of the enquiry into police
excesses.  So much the better for all.  But what passes our comprehension is
whether or not the Government have strictly adhered to the princeples
uderlying the terms.  Reports of non-release of prisoners in various parts of
the country, promulgation of Section 144 on political meetings, arrests and
convictions for political reasons, and various other happenings, which are
considered a total violation of the Agreement, are pouring into our ears
morning.  On the other hand, we are told that the local Governments contend
that the people have not always  observed the terms of the truce.  Whether or
not both parties are justified in their charges it is not for us to say.
In the light of the above, we honestly doubt if Gandhiji, behalf  of the
Congress, was sufficiently justified in having lowered the flag of
independence hoisted at Lahore by agreeing to the truce.  We honestly doubt
again if he fully satisfied that there was a real change of heart on the part of the
British Government, so as to commit the Congress to  a truce of this sort.  We
honestly doubt thirdly, if Gandhiji really thought that the British Government266       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwould take up seriously the question of Indian independence at the next Round
Table Conference, even if the Congress under his leadership participated.
Fourthly, we entertain an honest doubt if Gandhji thought for one moment that
the British Government would totally abdicate in favour of the Congress after
150 years of continued exploitation of a land which is almost their entire
subsistence and mainstay.  Fifthly, we doubt whether he believed that they
would surrender “the brightest jewel in the Crown of the British Empire” to
those from whom no exploitation is possible in future, and thus pave the way
for their own decline. And last but one, we honestly doubt whether Gandhiji
remembered how he has been betrayed on more than one occasion in the past
in his trust in the Government, and considered whether Young India   would
allow him to practise his political jugglery on the toiling millions once more
and for ever.
Last but not the least is the honest doubt we entertain whether there is
any ray of hope of success through Congress participation in the coming
Conference.  Who knows that once Gandhiji with his team has left India for
London they will be allowed to return to the scene of their activities, in case
the London conversations break down?  Who can guarantee to the Indian
delegation a hospitable reception in London during its stay there?
We honestly wonder whether it is not high time for us to present a united
front, and if necessary, to wade through a pool of blood, of course pursing the
creed of non-violence, to attain our one goal and that for now and  for ever.
The foregoing has been sent me by “The Youth of India” with
a duly signed covering letter. I have removed certain unnecessary
passages and made some alterations without changing the substance of
the charge.  There is truth in the statement that there are charges and
countercharges about breach of the Settlement by the parties
concerned.  But I am able to assure the public that so far the diffi-
culties have been removed.  The Central Government is anxious to
implement the Settlement as I know the Congess is.  And so long as
that condition persists, there  is no danger of a breakdown.  Beyond
this the public will not expect  me to go, whilst the very delicate
instrument is being worked and kept  in tune.
As to the Settlement itself, I have no doubt whatsoever that       
the Congress would have put itself in the wrong if it had not         
entered upon it.  And it was certainly patriotic on the part of Sjt.   
Subhas   Chandra  Bose and   the   young   men    who   were   behind   
him to have withdrawn their opposition and given their support to the
Settlement Resolution at Karachi.  The Karachi Congress did notVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        267lower the independence flag.  The Congress mandate is clear on the
point.
Whether the Congress will be able to make good its position at
the Round  Table Conference I do not know.  But I do know that it
would be wrong for the Congress to avoid the Conference for fear of
rejection of its demands.  The Conference is one way of showing the
absolute justice of the national demand.  It would have been foolish
for the Congrss to refuse participation when it was open to it to press
its full demand without reservation.The Congress would have betrayed
lack of courge if it had declined to avail itself of the opportunity,
when it came,  of presenting its case at the Round Table Conference.
Therefore I should not hesitate to go to London and attend the
Congerence if I found that I could safely go. My difficulty is funda-
mental and well known. I should not have the self-confidence to
present the Congress case, if we could not set our own house in order
by attaining a solution of the communal problem. But I am waiting,
watching and praying. As soon as the way is open, I should  not
hesitate to go wherever wanted.  The other difficulty is less serious, but
none the less important. As the principal party on behalf of the
Congress to the Pact,  I should feel most uneasy leaving India, when
serious questions arising out of the Settlement demand attention. I
have pledged my honour to Lord Irwin that I shall leave no stone
unturned to see that the Settlement does not break down. As I have
already hinted, I am having some difficulty with local Governments,
but I am hoping that with patience all will be well.  In any case I
believe in all humility that my presence in India is necessary to avoid
a crisis.
As for the other doubts of the wrter or writers of the letter,  I can
only repeat what I have said so often.  I will not lose hope till I know
that nothing is to be gained from negotiation.Since I believe in human
nature, in spite of previous disappointments, I must trust.  I regard it as
practical wisdom.  I rely for success upon the inherent justice of the
national cause and the equally just means adopted for its vindication.
I do not believe that the Congress delegation will be insulted in
London.  And if it is, the Congress will not lose its prestige. The loss
will accrue to those who will insult. I therefore ask the youthful writers
of the  letter not to lose hope, but work with all their might to make
the Settlement a success, and by working the constructive programme
enhance the power of the Congress to vindicate the national position.268       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIFor the measure of success at the Conference, if the Congress is
represented thereat, will  be in strict proportion to the measure of the
power of the Congress.

367.  MISSIONARY METHODS  IN  INDIA
Gandhiji has given great umbrage to missionaries by his declaration
against the prevailing methods of evangelization, and by challenging the
claim to superiority put forward by them on behalf of Christianity.  They
strongly resent his assertion that their modus operandi   is open to suspicion
.  .  .  .  It was stated in the Indian Census Report for 1911 that the aboriginal
tribes accept Christianity, “in the  hope of obtaining assistance from the
missionaries in their difficulties and protection the coercion of landlords.”  .  .
.  In 1821,  Raja Rammohan Roy urged in the Brahmanical  Magazine   that the
superiority of Christianity should not be advocated “by means of abuse and
insult or by affording the hope of worldly gain.”
.  .  .  Mrs. Charles Howard, Secretary,  Society for the Education of the
Women of India, Chicago, in a letter to Sr. Virchand R. Gandhi of Bombay,
wrote in 1896: “But I am more concerned for poor India.  Why should
Christianity, which is a failure here, be thrust upon India?”1
This comes from a retired Deputy Collector. The collection of
quotations from named sources should, instead of offending missio-
naries, cause an inward search. I have several other similar articles,
some from Christian Indians. The writers will excuse mefor with
holding them. The controversy ought not to be prolonged. The
incautious zeal of reporters, who trusted too much to memory, led to a
discussion2, which I would fain have avoided.

CHI.  VASUMATI,
I got your letter.  I have carefully read Nanalal’s letter.  If you
are required to stay at Visnagar in connection with that work, my
advice is against it.  The work is full of difficulties.  If Nanalal wishes
to speak to me, he is welcome.  In this matter I wil trust Krishnadas’s
judgment. Before coming to a decision, you should also know the
views of Budhabhai, Mathuradas and Narandas.  If  you have to
choose a place outside the Ashram for work, you should choose either
Nadiad or Bochasan.  I am inclined in favour of Bochasan, since the
work there has been put on a firm foundation.  However, if you are
under a moral obligation to work for that school at Nadiad, you
should certainly do your duty.  If you have held out any hope, you
ought to fulfil it.

375. LETTER TO MRIDULA SARABHAI
BARDOLI,
June 4, 1931
CHI. MRIDU,
It is quite all right that you wrote a long letter. You will surely
have benefited from your month-long stay at Simla. You will have
walked a lot. The suggestion that a boycott committee be formed
seems a good one. I am hoping to get something done at the meeting.
Most of our difficulties are due to the fact that we want to achieve the
boycott through khadi. The mills do have a place in the boycott
campaign. That place is secondary to khadi and is automatically
assured through our carrying on khadi work. Giving a special place to
the mills will make the mills lose, khadi lose and the boycott will fail.
Have you understood this key to boycott? If you have not understood,
I wish you would ask me again and again and understand. Read
carefully the article about boycott in the current issue of Young
India.1
You should never hesitate to write to me whenever you want to.

I have your letter.
(1)Village  sanitation is the duty of the State.
(2)If the State neglects it, the villagers may take it up.
(3)Municipality means the village service society.  Villagers can
themselves form such a society.
(4)Scavenging will cost nothing if performed by volunteers.
(5)In a small village even a few dedicated youths can do the
scavenging.

387.  LETTER TO EMMA HARKER
AS  AT  SABARMATI ,
June 5, 1931
DEAR  FRIEND,
I have your letter.  How can I remove the ban on foreign cloth
and why?  And what is the meaning of the ban?  It is merely a method
of persuasion.  If people want to wear foreign cloth, there is nothing
to prevent them from doing so.  But if there was national government,
the entry of foreign cloth would be surely prohibited as it was in the
time of Elizabeth in England.  It is true that the Lancashire workmen
may have to suffer during the transition stage.  But can it be any
reason for India’s cottage industry.  If in trying to undo the wrong,
Indians cease to use foreign cloth which it is their duty to do
Lancashire has to turn to a less injurious industry.  Where is the harm
and where is the wrong?  I would like you to work out this problem in
its details and you will find that ban on foreign cloth is a necessary
condition of the life of the millions of villagers of India.
You have evidently not studied the prohibition question in
America. I talked to both who are for prohibition and against prohi-
bition. Whilst it is true that prohibition has given rise to fashionable
crime it has saved tens of thousands of the labouring population ofVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        279America, who, having the temptation put away from them, are now
bringing up sober families.  But the conditions in India are infinitely
superior to those in America.  In America drink was the fashion and
yet its great men rose against it.  We are too near the time to measure
the greatness of America in having undertaken prohibition.  In India
drink is considered to be a vice and is confined to only a particular
class of people.  Prohibition will be therefore an unmixed good in this
land.

CHI.  NARANDAS,
I  got  your  letter. You  did  right  in having paid a visit to
Rajkot.
If you go on pleading with the elders through letters, they will
probably listen to your advice regarding khadi.
Some days ago, I had a letter from Mukundrai, which I am
sending on to you.  It will help you to a better understanding of the
facts about Mahalakshmi.  I did not know that she was related to
Gaurishankar.  I should be happy if you can take her into the
Ashram. Chhaganlal is also one of her relatives.
If  the other lady is what she seems to you, you can admit her.
You should try to know her husband.  If she had such intense aversion
against worldly happiness, why did she marry?  How old is she?  What
has been her education?  To which community does she belong?
What are her husband and father-in-law?  What is her father?  In
principle, we should admit such women.
If Ratubhai has gone to Bombay, we shall meet.  I had indeed
realized, when I went to Rangoon, that the Doctor was unhappy about
Lilavati.  But I will have a talk with Ratubhai when he meets me in
Bombay.
The suggestion that Madanmohan should stay with Jamnalalji
seems all right to me.  Haribhau was here and I had a talk with him     
too.  If he stays with Jamnalalji, there will be no need to pay him
anything.
We should let Amtulbehn stay in the Ashram if she is ready to
live in it till the end of her life.  She may be permitted to receive
money from outside.  If no one sends her any money, we should bear
the expenditure on her account.  I think she will recover if she does
very little physical work.  You must have got the bill of exchange in
Ba’s name which was received here.
If an inmate of the Ashram lives elsewhere, his expenses should
be borne by the people there.  If, however, Chhaganlal desires another
arrangement in regard to any person, do as he suggests.  I have written
to Chhaganlal also to this effect.
I have advised Dwarkanath that he should live outside Gujarat
till my suspicion against him regarding arms is removed.  He willVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        283leave in a few days.  We have get to decide what to do about his bill.
Chhaganlal thinks that he is innocent.  I have written to him and told
him that, if he feels inclined to pay the bill, he may do so.  If,
therefore, he writes to you requesting you to pay the bill, please do.
I shall leave this place on Monday and return on the 12th,
leaving Bombay on the 11th.

397.  LETTER  TO  R.  M.  MAXWELL
AS  AT  SABARMATI ,
June 6, 1931
DEAR  MR.  MAXWELL,
Reverting to your letter of the 13th May,1  at practically the
same time that I received your letter in Simla I received the news that
Syt. Rajawade was discharged although the letter under reply left me
no such hope. I was thankful to receive the telegraphic news which
was conveyed to me by Mr. Emerson.  I have now received the papers
about Syt. H. D. Rajah and on a persual of the papers I can find no
incitement to violence.  The speeches themselves are not before me
because I am told that they are not to be found in the record of the
case, but the evidence of the Crown witnesses and the Judge’s
summing up bring out the most relevant parts of the speeches, which
though highly discourteous and equally seditious, contain no
incitement to violence.  On the contrary, the judge himself refers to
the profession of non-violence by the accused but dismisses it as lip
1 Vide “Letter from R. M. Maxwell”, 13-5-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        285service.  In the absence of any direct incitement to violence I cannot
see how it is possible for a judge to infer mere lip service when there is
a direct assertion of non-violence.  But I have not relied upon my own
opinion.  I put the thing before three legal friends, one of whom has
kindly reduced his opinion to writing, copy of which I enclose
herewith.  In the circumstances I request His Excellency to reconsider
his decision and beg to point out that under Cl. 13 of the Settlement
there is no option but to discharge the civil disobedience prisoners
who might not be guilty of offences involving violence other than
technical violence or incitement to such violence.  I venture to suggest
that where there is no incitement on the fact of the evidence it is not
open to the Government to deduce such incitement.
Then there is the case of Ratanji Dayaram of Bardoli Taluka.  I
have now studied the judgment and evidence in this case.  There is
certainly no violence as contemplated in Cl. 13 of the Settlement.  It is
also moreover incorrect to say that the accused burnt his tenant’s
crop.  The accused burnt his own crop which he owned jointly with
the complainant Devalia Jagla.  If the complainant suffered any
damage it was open to him, as it is even now, to bring a civil suit
against the accused.  But where, on the evidence itself and the finding
of the judge admitted by the Government, the crop was burnt in order
to prevent the Government officials from collecting revenue from
selling the crop, there was no question of intending to damage the
partner.  And may I point out the inconsistency of the Government in
releasing the co-accused, Ranchhod, who had no ownership in the
crop and keeping Ratanji Dayaram who was admittedly joint owner of
the crop.  I must, therefore, for the same reason as in the case of Syt.
H. D. Rajah, ask for Ratanji Dayaram’s discharge in terms of the
Settlement.
With reference to your second letter of 30th May last,  I can     
only say that the position taken up by His Excellency causes me       
deep pain. The reasoning given for refusing to return the press        
seems  to   me to be extraordinary. It  is  giving back  and  not  taking
back.  Cl. 16 throws  the burden on  the Government  of  returning
and not on the party dispossessed of going to take back. The  reason-
ing  given   in   the   third  paragraph  of  your letter  causes  still
greater pain.  I was unprepared for the interpretation that is sought to
be put upon the Ordinance. I cannot question the inter-pretation but I286      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIdo question the propriety of putting an irritating interpretation in
connection with a document of peace.  What the Government seek to
do is to justify wanton destruction of property by Government
officials.  But in order to bring within the smallest compass possible
points of dispute between the Government and myself as representing
the Congress, I have advised the owners of the motor-car and bicycle
to remove them, if they chose to do so.  So far as the press is
concerned I am sorry to say that I must ask for due fulfilment of the
terms of the Settlement. If the Government seriously question my
interpretation I am quite willing to submit the question for decision to
the Chief Justice of the High Court of Bombay or any other impartial
authority.
Yours sincerely,

the present moment.  I have consulted consulted him and if you per-
sonally approve of the suggestion, he is willing to be nominated by
me in terms of the resolutions.  The other name also he has suggested
and I have accepted. It is Acharya Narendra Deva of Kashi Vidyapith.
Both these are seasoned soldiers and have considerable experience in
those matters.  In view of these two names it is unnecessary for me just
now to suggest names of experts at least at the present moment.
In the resolution, I suggest for better reading the following
alterations : In the place of “on self-supporting basis” say “in order
to make the institution self-supporting” and after the words “to
collect”, add “and disburse”.
Yours sincerely,

DEAR  SISTER,
I had your telegram and I have now your letter.Things in
Bengal are certainly most deplorable but I do not know what can be
done from here.  I thought that arbitration was the only thing that can
relieve the tension.  What else could be done  either by the Working
Committee or me personally? Subhasbabu came here and gave Sardar
Vallabhbhai a long indictment against Syt. Sen Gupta. Vallabhbhai
has filed it hoping to be able to investigate the complaints when both
the parties were present.  Can you suggest any other way out of the
difficulty?

I have your letter.  I can well understand the position but in
cases like the one you mentioned very little can be done just now.  I
can only say that if in spite of these provocations, peaceful picketing

DEAR  SATIS  BABU,
I have your letter and cutting from the Amrita Bazar Patrika .
What can be done beyond suggesting arbitration in the place of the
cumbersome procedure that will have to be adopted by the Working
Committee if the matter has to be decided by it.  Subhasbabu was here
and gave Sardar Vallabhbhai a long list of complaints against Sen
Gupta.  Vallabhbhai could do nothing but said that when the matter
came formally before the Working Committee, he will deal with the
complaint.  But when he and I began to receive wires from Bengal, I
suggested local arbitration. Is there any other way besides such
arbitration or decision by the Working Committee when the matter
formally comes before it?
If you are well enough, you should come to Bombay and
discuss the position at the All-India Spinners’ Association Comittee
meeting.  I cannot advise Dr. Roy to come to Ahmedabad especially
when several mill-owners are outside Ahmedabad.
If you have not seen the file of the Samachar  of 1828 I think
you ought to see it and verify the spinner’s letter1 yourself.

exercise their children. If Nimu or you do not know it, you should
learn it. It is very useful. Laying the child flat on the back, raise and
bend the legs so that the toes touch the forehead. The knees should
not bend. Do you understand what I mean? The baby should be held
tightly by the feet upside down for a minute or a half. The exercise

406.  WORKER-VILLAGE  RATIO
How many workers would be needed to cover seven lakh
villages?  This question requires serious consideration.  The British
flag flies in each and every village, that is to say, all of them use the
Government’s currency, and pay revenue in that currency.  But the
Congress has not been able to cover all the villages.  Even its name has
not reached every village, let alone its message.  The Congress can
reach every village through khadi, but we do not have enough interest
in khadi for that purpose.
The reader will be surprised to know that, though the Govern-
ment’s authority is recognized in every village, every one of them
does not have a Patel, a talati or a constable.  All that it has been able
to do is to put a few villages under each talati and Patel. A talati
should be an educated person, for he is supposed to keep accounts.
He has, therefore, more villages under him than a Patel.  If the
Government does not have a talati and a Patel for every village, how
can the Congress have a worker for every one of them.  I know that
the ratio of workers and villages should be exactly the opposite of thatVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        291of talatis and Patels and villages.  The Congress should have the
capacity which the Government does not possess.  But we must admit
with shame that it is not so.  The Government cannot afford to spend
enough money to keep a talati and a Patel in each village.  The
Congress does not need to spend money.  It can get volunteers but its
name has not reached every corner so that it can have a volunteer in
each village.
In these circumstances, it would be extravagance on the part of
the Congress to have more than one worker per village.  We should
group the villages into blocks, each with a radius of ten miles.  As our
resources and the number of volunteers increase, we can increase the
number of blocks but at present one volunteer should be able to cover
ten miles from a central point.  So the diameter of his working area
would be twenty miles. But the volunteer will never have to walk
twenty miles at a time.  There is no rule that he must always sleep in
the central village.  Not only may he spend a night in any village
within the limit of ten miles, but it would be actually his duty to spend
a night in each of    them by turn.  There would be at least ten villages
in such a block with a radius of ten miles. So, according to me, there
would be one worker for every ten villages.  Hence we require seventy
thousand men and women volunteers to cover all the villages in the
country. I said women volunteers. But really speaking we should
count their numbers on a different basis.  If, in early stages, two of
them stay together then we would require more than seventy thousand
volunteers, or the volunteers would have to be posted in  different
manner according to the number of women volunteers included in the
total.  It should be obvious that to post more than one worker per
village would be a crime.
Let us now think each worker can do.  He can easily :
1.collect children and teach them how to spin on the takli,
card cotton, make taklis, and also teach them the three R’s; for this he
can draw up a modest scheme and plan a curriculum;
2.look after the cleanlines of the villages and himself work to
keep them clean;
3.give medicine to sick persons;
4.if there are quarrels among different groups and parties in
a village, bring them together;
5.relieve the hardships of the untouchables, provide facilities
for drinking water for them if they do not have any;
6.try to make the village self-reliant in regard to khadi;292      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI7.prepare a census of each village in his block, count the
number of cattle in each under the heads of cows, she-buffaloes,
bullocks, he-buffaloes and male and female calves, calculate average
yield of buffalo’s milk and cow’s milk, prepare a census of the
Antyajas and write a general description of their conditions, find out
the area of each village, its crops, the amount of land revenue paid by
it, its crafts and industries, the number of wells in it and note whether
any fruits and babul trees grow in the villages or in the fields within its
limits.  Though I have mentioned this activity last, the volunteers
should take it up first.  This work does not require much time.  But
the volunteer who has gathered all this informationn would find his
work much easier.  He should record all this information in a small
exercise book.
No volunteer should say that he cannot do all this work      
unaided in ten villages.  Just as a school works only for a few hours
daily, similarly we should not mind if it works only for one  day in the
week.  It will not matter if the school in each village works on every
tenth day. I have stated a extreme possibility. I actual practice, a
newly-posted volunteer will immediately collect the  statistics about
the villages in his block and then train men and women volunteers in
every village and assign them work according to their capacity.  In
this way he will become a supervisor-worker.  On the days on which
he is not present in a particular village, the local volunteers will carry
on the work.
One quality is essential in such a worker and that is purity of
character.  If he is a slave of his eleven senses he will be able to do no
work.  These eleven senses are the five of perception, the five of action
and the mind.  If the mind is pure, then the ten senses automtically
remain pure.  If the mind is impure, then everything else will be
impure.  The senses of action are the arms, the legs, the mouth, and
two private organs.  The senses of knowledge are the skin, the sense of
touch, the palate, the ear for hearing, the nose for smelling and the
eyes for sight.  Anyone who cannot control these should humbly
refuse to become a volunteer.  If he has become one and then later on
finds that he is unable to control his senses, he should humbly resign.
This is the right way if we want work to be done.
Some might say that this programme cannot be completed in a
hundred years and we want swaraj just now.  This objection has no
force. We shall not have an abundance of workers when we get swaraj.
Those who are workers now will run the country under swaraj.  It isVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        293true that those who run the administration at present will be there
when its control is handed over to the people. If, however, the
Congress does not have the type of volunteers that I have suggested,
then we shall lose control of the administration or it will become
corrupt and there will be anarchy in the country.  There is no reason
to suppose that those who are hated now will become godlike
overnight as soon as the control of the administration changes hands.
Hence, as we sow now, so shall we reap.  If we get sincere workers, the
programme that I have chalked out can begin today. “Let us first
have seventy thousand volunteers and map out the country into blocks
of ten miles each and then we shall see what work to take up.” This is
not the right way to start work.  If we approach the task thus, we shall
succeed in doing nothing.
The right method is this : Gujarat should start immediately.  If
work cannot be started in the whole of Gujarat, it should be started in
one or two districts, or even talukas, and if even that is not possible,
then the few workers in the different parts in Gujarat should begin as I
have suggested and leave whatever is not essential or cannot be done
well.  They should start whatever they can do.  If there are more
workers than one at one place, they should disperse themselves.  If
they decide to stay together where they are,   they should do so after
considering whether that is necessary. They should not deceive
themselves or the people through mental or physical lethargy.

HINDUS’  SHAME
In Dakor on 22nd May, 1931, there was a meeting of Bhangis
of which Thakkar Bapa has sent me a report.  I give below its
substance :
About 1,500 Bhangis from 150 villages had gathered.
They had crected a mandap1 of canvas with the ground also
covered with canvas in which they could hold their meetings and
sleep at night.  The meetings were held in this mandap during
the day and at night they slept in it. But no one would give them
utensils for cooking and they could not get drinking water. The
water of the Gomati pond is so dirty that there are municipal
signboards at numerous spots warning people not to use it for
drinking.  But Bhangis can drink it!  How could they drink such
dirty water at a gathering like this?  One Muslim gentleman took
pity on them.  He gave them utensils, helped them in cooking
and gave them water too.
No Hindu of Dakor, which is a centre of pilgrimage, felt
ashamed at this or took pity on the Bangis.  The guests had
come from distant places, but could get no water, no utensils and
no food though there was an abundance of everything in the
town.  the women volunteers of Dakor could have cooked for
them.  It was the duty of the Mahajan2 in Dakor to supply water
to these people.  They failed in this duty and dimmed the lestre
of Hinduism.
“But   this   sort  of  thing  happens  everywhere  and   no  one
cares  for  Bhangis.   Was  it  the  duty  of  Hindus  of  Dakor  spe-
cially on  this    occasion  to  do all  that?”  Yes,  it  was.  The  fact
that one’s for efathers  have  been committing  a  particular sin  gives
one no right to go  on committing it.  As  the  days  pass, the  awake-
ning  among  the  Antyajas  increases,  this e vil  in Hinduism  is being
recognized  and  more   and  more  caste  Hindus  feel  ashamed  of  
the  practice.   The  person who drafted the report is a Hindu and the
person who sent it is also a Hindu.  All of us want to implement the
resolution on rights passed by the Congress. Whatever may have

of inustice that was shown in Dakor.  There will be no distinction
between Antyajas and others under swaraj.  Let us, therefore, wake up.
THINK  CAREFULLY  OVER  THIS
There is a village named Bharthari in Thasara taluka.  There a
person named Dhanjibhai, an Antyaja, is trying hard to reform other
Antyajas.  From the report that I have received about his work I see
that he silently bears the hardship which he has to suffer because of
his activities.  One of the reform which he is trying to persuade the
Antyajas to adopt is to give up eating carrion and to this end to give
up the work of disposal of dead cattle.  To persuade them to stop
eating carrion is of course good, but to persuade them to give up the
occupation of disposing of dead cattle seems to me a very harmful
move.  I think myself the occupation is sacred, and certainly most
useful.  It is sacred because it helps in preserving sanitation. If dead
animals were left unattended, the air whould be polluted,diseases
would spread and the country’s wealth would be wasted.  Cattle serve
the people after they die as much a they do while alive.  We use their
skin, bones, flesh and guts for many purposes.   If we use living cattle
properly and use the hide, etc., of dead cattle scientifically, their value
would increase so much that it would not be profitable to slaughter
them.
I would, therefore, suggest to reformers that they should not
persuade Bhangis and Chamars to leave their occupation but they
should, on the contrary, give them proper knowledge about their
work. This requires training. It is only in our country that this
occupation is considered low.  In the West we find even millionaires
engaged in it.  If instead of becoming clerks, after graduation, young
men learn the Chamar’s work, learn how to skin dead cattle and how
to make use of the other parts, then the present drain of crores of
rupees to foreign countries because of our ignorance in this matter
would stop and Chamars would no longer look upon their occupation
as low.  We shall be able to eradicate untouchability not when the
Chamars give up their work but only when the Hindus realize their sin
and when the Antyajas rid themselves of some evils which have
entered their lives.

Navajivan , 7-6-1931296      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI408.  POOR  MAN’S  HUNDI
Vithaldashbai complains from his sick-bed that khadi stocks are
accumulating. The workers of Gujarat write to inform me that because
of this they are forced to give less work to spinners.  This complaint
regarding khadi is a matter of shame for us.  Those who wear khadi  
know that by doing so they help women who are among the poorest
in the country. If all of us understand this fact, the demand for khadi
will never go down.  As we always get the cash value of a currency
note printed on, it, so we should always be able to get money for
khadi at the price fixed by us.  Khadi is a sort of hundi drawn by the
poor.  There should be men and women in cities who whould always
accept such hundis.  And so long as this hundi is available, no one
should touch any other hundi.
If I can have my way and if people co-operate, khadi will always
be sold at a fixed price.  The price of cotton may vary, but if the
women who  spin and the weavers are paid at uniform rates in their
respective provinces and the rates of payment for the other proceses
are also uniform, there should be no difficulty in having a fixed price
for every variety of khadi. Since we do not possess the requisite
honesty, efficiency of organization and sympathy for the poor, the
prices of khadi hav been changing. However, anyone who takes the
slightest interest in khadi knows that in every province the prices have
declained from what they were ten years ago.  I have already pointed
out in these columns1 that, of the khadi produced in the Meerut
Ashram, where it is manufactured in large quantities, those varieties
which previously cost one rupee now generally cost less than six
annas.  This does not mean that the women spinners are paid less.  It
only means that the workers have acquired greater skill in all the
processes of khadi manufacture.The quality of spinning has improved
and, in consequence, the weavers’ work has become easier.  This has
made it possible to reduce the rate of pay-ment to weavers without
reducing their total earnings.  It has been possi-ble to bring about this
happy result of reduction in prices because a philanthropic body is
organizing khadi work. Thanks to this fact, the quality of khadi has
progressively improved and the prices have come down.There is
1 Vide “Notes” sub-title Gandhi Ashram, Meerut, 4-6-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        297considerable scope for still further improvement in quality and
reduction in prices and this will happen as more and more people
patronize khadi.  It is evident that, as the demand for khadi increases,
a larger number of people and more skilled people will take interest in
it and the quality will improve and the prices decrease.  The
shareholders in the poor man’s company are not limited to a small
number, but are the thirty crores in the country.  Then why should
there be any difficulty in selling khadi?  But the difficulty is a fact
and it is, therefore, fruitless to ask that question.  It would be wiser to
dicover ways of selling it.  The following means suggest themselves :
1.To go round hawking khadi.  At all places women should
do this only on fixed days, so that they will not have to go round
every day.  It would be enough if they give some hours on some days
in the week.  As in the West the wives of millionaires visit hospitals,
etc., on certain days in the week, so the women here should go round
hawking khadi.
2.Leaflets giving a list of the varities of khadi and their prices
should be distributed to every household.
3.Talks about khadi should be arranged in all residential
streets.
I have only given a few suggesions for guidance.  But those who
love khadi and have resourceful brains will be able to think out many
other ways of selling the accumulated stocks of khadi.

Navajivan , 7-6-1931298      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI409.  USE  ANOTHER  NAME
An Antyaja friend writes :1
Such a feeling is natural in this age of awakening.  A person
does not like the name which is applied to him in contempt, though its
origin may have been quite innocent. Formerly the name Antyaja was
not felt as expressing contempt.  The names Dhed and Bhangi were
disliked.  I think the term ‘ Dalit’ was first used by the late Swami
Shraddhanand.  Now it seems that name also is not liked.  This real
explanation is that as long as the poison of untouchability exists in
our society, any name that   may be given will probably come to be
disliked after some time.  Hence the right thing to do is to get rid of
that poison and for this we need the co-operation of the Antyajas men
and women.  It is of course the duty of the Hindus to get rid of this
poison unconditionally.  Atonement for one’s sin need not depend on
any condition being fulfilled.  But however sincere the efforts of
Hindus to atone for their sin, the evils which have crept into the lives
of the untouchables because of the sin of Hindus can be eradicated
only by their own efforts.  They will require the help of caste Hindus
in their efforts.  They are getting it slowly and its tempo is likely to
increase.  But even after taking all this into account, ultimately the
Antyajas will have to rely on their own efforts.  Though it is thus
necessary to attack the root cause, if a better word than Antyaja or
Dalit occurs to anyone he may send it to me.

410.  A  SUPERSTITION
I give below the substance of what one cultured and very pious
mother writes : “After my son’s death I have left off milk and ghee.
I live on rice, dal, roti, and buttermilk.  I have lost interest in life but I
pass my time by devoting myself to service in one way or another.  I
read Ramayana  and other books, but deep inside the memory of my
dear son continues to pain me.”
1 The letter is not translated here.  The correspondent had expressed his sense
of humiliation at the word ‘ Antyaja’ and requested Gandhiji to coin some new word to
denote his community.  For the choice of the word ‘Harijan’, vide “Notes”, 2-8-1931,
sub-title, “Harijan”.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        299This mother’s health was already weak and now it has become
weaker.  It is not certain even whether she will survive or not.  As I
have summarized the mother’s letter, I also give the substance of my
reply to her.1
To mourn the death of either son or husband is meaningless and
shows our ignorance.  This should not be dismissed as merely wise
talk; it is a truth to be pondered over till it sinks into our heart and to
be acted upon.  Since death is certain for all, the only question is
whether it comes today or tomorrow.  Why, then, should we grieve
over anyone’s death?  It is only the body which dies.  That is its
nature and therefore there is no cause for wonder when it dies.  It is
certain that the soul which dwells in the body never dies, it is
immortal.  When we know this as certain truth, why should we grieve
over death?
Even if we assume that we are bound to be pained by death,        
is fasting or restriction of food a remedy for our grief?  Whom          
does it help?  The one who is dead?  And if so, does it help the body
which has perished, or the immortal soul?  The body that used to eat is
now ashes or is being eaten up by worms.  The soul neither eats nor
drinks.  Why then should the mother or the wife restrict her food?
In other words, the mother or wife restricting her food has no
effect on the body or the soul of the dead person.  If we desire the
welfare of the departed soul or wish to keep his memory alive for ever,
we shall not be able to fulfil our wish by fasting but shall fulfil both
aims by retaining his virtues in ourselves.  We can also contribute to
perpetuating his memory by making donations to worthy causes.
Does fasting or control over food then serve no purpose?  In
this case at any rate they serve none.  They can be undertaken within
certain limits, either for the purpose of self-purification or for curing
a disease.  We shall not discuss the second possibility.  Control of the
palate, then, aims at self-purification.  Restriction of food or fasting,
therefore, has this limit.  Fasting is not the right way of atoning for a
lie.  The right way of doing so is to take a vow always to speak the
truth in future, to renounce whatever serves as a temptation to us to tell
a lie.  If, however, a  person cannot control his palate, the remedy is
fasting or restriction of diet.  Anyone who has overcome all cravings
of the palate eats only for keeping his body alive.  His diet is restricted
to a few items and the quantity also is measured. Such men and
1 Vide “Letter to Hemprabha Das Gupta”, 2-6-1931300      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIwomen take food as medicine.  If they practise further self-denial,
they commit a sin because, if they do not eat, their bodies would
become weak.  The body is an instrument of service. Anyone who
weakens that instrument is a thief.  Such persons number hardly a few
among crores.  I have used this illustration only to explain my
meaning.
We ordinary human beings daily indulge our palate.  It is,
therefore, necessary that we should occasionally fast and restrict our
diet.  But this should be done only to kill the cravings of the palate.
To do it because of someone’s death or for some similar reason is a
form of self-deception and may even be sinful.

411.  A  LETTER
BARDOLI,
June 7, 1931
Sardar Garda met me at Swaraj Ashram, Bardoli, on April 25th
in the company of Sir Cowasji Jehangir, Syt. K. F. Nariman, Sjt.
Vimadalal, Rao Bahadur Bhim Bhai and another Parsi friend.  He was
brought by Sir Cowasji Jehagir and other friends in connection with
the forfeited land belonging to Bardoli peasants which he had
purchased during the Civil Disobedience Movement.  He complained
about the treatment he had received at the hands of the people.  I told
him that whatever complaints he might make I would undertake to
invetigate and give him satisfaction.  All the friends persuaded him to
return the said land.  He insisted not only on the price he had paid for
the land being returned to him, namely, Rs. 6000 in addition which he
said he had spent on the land.  Sir Cowasji assured him that sum also
would be forthcoming. He then said that he would most probably
decide to restore the land for the purchase price plus the said sum of
Rs. 6000, but that he would have to consult his people and the give a
final reply which he would do inside of two days.  In the course of the
conversation Sardar Garda said that the land he had bought was fully
worth  four lakhs of rupees and that he would not have bought it but

saying that Sardar Garda had passed a note to him to the effect that he
had decided to restore the land for the above sum.  The enclosed is a
copy of the letter passed by Sardar Garda to Rao Bahadur Bhim Bhai.
The letter was also published in the papers and the agreement was
duly announced to the people concerned.  On May 7th I received a

attached. I also attach the further correspondence since passed
between Sardar Garda and myself.

412.  LETTER  TO K. B. BHADRAPUR
AS  AT  SABARMATI ,
June 7, 1931
DEAR  MR.  BHADRAPUR,
I write this letter in connection with the present Mukhi1 of Ras.  I
discussed the question of his removal and the appointment of the old
Mukhi with Mr. Perry more than once and I had hoped that by this
time at least the Ras Mukhi would have been removed.  The this time
at least the Ras Mukhi would been removed. The matter is now
becoming urgent as a deputation on behalf of the non-Dharala
inhabitants of Ras waited on me yesterday and complained that life
was becoming unbearable for them there.  I enclose herewith particu-
lars of destruction that is alleged to have gone on in Ras during the
past fortnights. They mentioned also that personal assaults were added
to the injury to property.  It is not suggested that the Mukhi himself
has personally done these things but it is suggested that they have
been done with his connivance, if not instigation. It will be readily
admitted that if the statements made in the memorandum hereto
attached are at all true, it won’t be possible for the non-Dharala
population to proceed with the cultivation of their fields as soon as
rains commence. Suggestion has already been made that the
Mukhiship should be divided into three parts, each part being held by
a different person. I need hardly say this will not do. Either the
present Mukhi is an undesirable person or he is not. If he is an
1 Village headman302      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIundesirable person, in accordance with the terms of the Settlement and
the admission made by the Commissioner, undesirable Mukhis should
be removed.  And in view of the fact that there is a conviction for theft
against the present Mukhi of Ras, his removal is surely overdue.  This
I ask irrespective of and without prejudice to my contention that
appointments of Mukhis for definite terms are not permanent
according to the meaning of the Settlement. I shall therefore be
obliged if you will kindly let me know as early as possible whether it
is the intention of the Government to remove this Mukhi and protect
the life and property of the inhabitants of Ras.
Yours sincerely,

DEAR  FRIEND,
I thank you for your letter.  As a matter of fact I have got ample
Christian Science literature with me. You will not mind my saying that
somehow or other the message of Christian Science does not appeal to
me. I met so many Christian scientists in South Africa.  Their
conversations also failed to convince me.  And why do you say that
the discovery that there is really no life or sensation in the body is the
most important discovery of any kind that has ever been made?  As a
matter of fact the statement is not a complete proposition.  By the
body is evidently meant body without life is without sensation and
every Hindu child is taught that from childhood.  But I must not enter
into a discussion.  I felt that your long letter was entitled to a reasoned
reply from me.

I thank you for your letter of 9th May.  I am most closely
watching your activity not in terms of the newspapers but its reaction
upon the commual spirit. Solution of the communal question may be
beyond the powers of Conciliation Committees, but if they tend to
promote peace it would be a very big step forward.  You are also
interesting me in another activity of yours, bee-keeping and honey-
making.  I would love to see the industry of bee-keeping becoming
universal in India.  The only question is whether it is possible to make
bee-keeping profitable.  I tried to make some experiments but I have
failed hitherto.  You will deserve the gratitude of people if you can
devise method whereby poor people can take to this industry.

AS  AT  SABARMATI ,
June 7, 1931
After having kept me waiting for many long months you have at
last written to me.  What a bad things that Menon has not yet got his
diploma.  I had a letter from a mutual friend saying that you were
disheartened over this failure.  This is unworthy of you as I have
known you.  No failure, no adversity should dishearten you who have
a living faith in God and his goodness.  We do not know that every
failure is a matter for sorrow nor do we know that every adversity is an
infliction.  Do we not often find that prosperity and success mean the
undoing of people whereas failure and adversity chasten them?
I do not know that I am going to London.  If I do, I will of
course love to go to Denmark and if I went there I should not like to
miss you.  But it is no speculating on a highly problematical thing.
I do hear from Maria, now and again.
After dictating this I came upon another letter which mentionns
you more intimately.  This letter is from Dr. Henning Dalsgaard.  In
that letter he says you are cheerful but he asks me concrete
proposition.  Have you any such in view?  If you have, thing, you
know also you can rely upon my doing it.

Silence Day, June 8, 1931
CHI.  KANTI,
Here is the reply to your letter.  The word ‘love’ has two
meanings : one, ignorant attachment, and, two, non-violence.  Love
between man and woman mostly takes the form of ignorant
attachment and, therefore, it is undesirable.  It cannot become all-
embracing love.  If a man marries many woman or a woman many
men, the world would be destroyed.  Only that love which takes the
form of non-violence can become all-embracing, and anybody who
wishes to cultivate such love must renounce the other love, born of
ignorant attachment, which a man and a woman feel for each other.
The wheel of worldly life is kept moving, and will be kept moving, by
a love which is a mixture of the two kinds.  It helps human beings to
satisfy their own needs and also to serve the race.  What I have written
pertains to love in its purest form.  If we are clear in our minds about
the ideal, it will be possible on its basis to formulate proper norms for
practical life.  If we base the ideal on the prevailing practice, we would
lower both the ideal and the practice.  If you do not follow anything
in this, ask me again.  I am returning your letter herewith.

Gandhiji addressed the processionists from a balcony.  He said that they
should finish their daily rounds before sunrise, singing selected songs of prayer and
devotion to God and the Motherland.  He said no objectionable songs, inconsistent
with the Congress creed, should be sung.

WHO  CAN  BE  CONGRESS  OFFICE  HOLDER?
A Sindhi correspondent asks :
1.Whether a man dealing in foreign cigarettes and tobacco can be a
president of the Congress Committee?
2.Whether persons dealing in foreign cloth can be vice-president and
treasurer of the Congress Committee?
3.Whether a person connected with foreign-cloth dealers can be secretary of
the Congress Committee?
These are bad questions.  If the correspondent had said whether
such and such a person should be, I could have given my opinion for
what it might be worth.  But when he asks whether a particular type of
person can be officer it betrays ignorance of the democratic character
of the constitution of the Congress.  Even a drunkard and a rake can
become president of Congress Committee or a secretary if his
constituents elect him to that office.  But one may assume that so long
as the constituents are sober and pure, they will not elect a drunkard
or a rake.  Similarly if they are believers in out-and-out swadeshi only,
they will not elect anyone who deals in foreign cloth or such foreign
goods as are now manufactured in India.  And so far as things
injurious to the nation are concerned, as for instance intoxicating
drinks and drugs, Congressmen will make no distinction between
foreign and swadeshi goods. All injurious things must be regarded as
taboo whether they are foreign or home-made.
COARSE  MILL  CLOTH  AS  KHADI
Complaints are being received from several quarters, Madras,
Bengal and Bombay Presidencies and elsewhere that coarse mill-cloth
is being sold as khadi and that though since the understanding with
the Congress, khadi labels are not used by mill-owners, in their
invoices and otherwise, coarse cloth is shown as khadi.  If the
information is correct, it is clearly a breach of the agreement with the
Congress.  Mills ought to be satisfied with the profits they are making
by reason of the Congress campaign, but if they will greedily and
unlawfully appropriate the name ‘khadi’ somehow or other and at
some stage or other for their wares, they will be following the example
of the miser who, in the attempt to get a cocoanut free of charge, lost
his life.314       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHISWARAJ  BHAVAN  HOSPITAL

433.  MY  FAITH
A Bangali correspondent who gives his name and address even
for publication if necessary has written a long letter which I condense
as follows :
Much has been said about Bhagat Singh and his comrades,
yet even now I find great difficulty in appreciating the wisdom
of passing the resolution at the Karachi Congress.
I am afraid it will not be possible for me to explain to you
properly the different peculiar and surreptitious ways in which
your remarks about Bhagat Singh and the Karachi Resolution
extolling him are being exploited here by some interested
politicians to serve their own purpose and under-mine your
influence.
1.They accuse you for the niggardly way in which the
resolution had been worded by you. These people are trying to
impress  upon  the  minds  of  the  young  men  that  you  really   
had no sincere sympathy for those unfortunate men and that
you gave your support to the resolution and  expressed your
admiration for Bhagat Singh and his comrades only being
prevailed upon by the Navajuvanwallas, whose strong agitation
you could not resist, and you wanted to placate Pandit  Jawah-
arlal.
2.They question your integrity and sincerity and try to
belittle you (and your cause) by surreptitiously propagating an
idea in Bengal that while you gave your active support to the
resolution about Bhagat Singh at Karachi you severely criticized
the late Deshbandhu Das for his responsibility in carrying out
an exactly similar resolution at Faridpur Conference praising
1 The letter, containing a list of donors, is not reproduced here.  For the
appeal, vide “The Allahabad Congress Hospital an Appeal”, 14-5-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      315Gopinath Saha1 who lost his life on the gallows under exactly
similar circumstances; and in this they say you  are not  immune
from provincial bias.  They are taking every opportunity to
undermine your influence in Bengal by appealing to the
sentiment of local patriotism. They say that many Bengal youths
sacrificed their lives even within this very year for the same
cause for which Bhagat Singh and his comrades died.  Among
those who thus died in Bengal there were Benoy Bose and his
comrade, there were the Chittagong raiders—the twenty-one
lads, who died fighting bravely against the British troops on the
Jalallabad Hills whose deeds were much more courageous and
romantic than you would imagine, but how strange—you did
not find romance there : not a word of sympathy passed from
your lips!  The insidious appeal made to their sentiment of local
patriotism easily estranges them from you and your path of
non-violence.
I have already expressed my doubts as to the propriety of my
having drafted and sponsored the Bhagat Singh resolution not
because it was wrong in principle but for the misinterpretation it has
lent itself to.  But the reader must know that it was neither the fear of
the Navajuvans nor my love for Pandit Jawaharlal that prompted me to
initiate the resolution.  Not that I should be ashamed of yielding to
Navajuvans or placating Jawaharlal.  I should be foolish if I did not
yield to Navajuvans, if yielding advanced the interest of the country
and involved no sacrifice of principle.  And I should go a very long
way to please Jawaharlal and retain his affection which I have the
privilege of posses-sing in abundance.  But there was no prompting
required in this case. I had  interested myself in the movement for the
commutation of the death sentence on Bhagat Singh and his comra-
des.  I had put my whole being into the task.  I had therefore to study
the life of the principal actor in the tragedy.  I had to come in contact
with his devoted father and those who were attached to Bhagat Singh
not for his deed but for his character.  I was thus drawn to the
resolution in the natural course.  I am too sensitive not to be moved
by circumstances demanding sympathy.
Therefore had I found myself impelled to interest myself in any
of the Bengali youths and had fancied myself in possession of
1 Vide “Notes”, sub-title Rabbi May.316       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIinfluence which I could exercise in their behalf, I should have with
equal zest plunged myself into their case. I regard myself as incapable
of having any provincial bias.  Bengal is as dear to me as the Punjab.
And I owe a special debt to Bengal for the inspiration it gave me in
my youth.  It is true that Deshbandhu and I differed as to the
emphasis in the matter of Gopinath Saha resolution.
I do not know that my resolution1 on Gopinath Saha differed in
substance from the Karachi Resolution.  But the reader should know
that whatever our differences, Deshbandhu and I always remained
friends.  Indeed towards the end of his all too short life, we came
much nearer each other even in our ideals and methods of working
towards them.
I should therefore be sorry to discover that there was any secret
propaganda against me in Bengal. I have many precious co-workers
in Bengal.  I want the number to grow.  I know the value of the co-
operation of the youth of Bengal.  I need it for their sakes, for the
sake of the country they love so well, but sometimes, alas, blindly.
They must not by their unwarranted prejudice deny themselves the
service of a true friend.  If I have any influence over the youth of the
country, it is a treasure I want to use for gaining the freedom of the
motherland.  I am therefore glad that my correspondent has given me
the opportunity of stating my position.  But whether I retain my hold
on the youth of Bengal or any other province or I do not, I must
proclaim my creed from the house-top.  Freedom of India’s starving
millions is attainable only through Truth and Ahimsa.

My attention has been drawn to an unfortunate error that crept
into my advice to the kisans of U.P.1 in Young India  28th May last, p.
127, line 53.  The line reads “as a general rule less than 8 annas or 4
annas as the case may be”.  It should read “12 annas” instead of “4
annas”.  I am sorry for the slip.  I hope however no one was misled
by the slip.  The preceding lines left no room for dubt.

goodness for weakness and then perceive the strength lying behind his
goodness.  For they will soon find their mistake when they see that
whilst he is gentle and forbearing towards them he is firm like a rock
in his action in protecting the untouchables. As time passes, the
villagers will forfeit all sympathy and Sjt. Subanagounder will gain the
active sympathy and help of the public.  The only condition is that he
must be prepared to sacrifice everything, suffer even his fields to lie
fallow if the sinful boycott by the villagers succeeds in scaring labour
away from him.  It is some consolation that he has four friends who
stand by him.  But he should be prepared to carry out his resolution,
even if he loses these friends.  For I am sure that he will lose only to
gain.  God loses these friends.  For I am sure that he will lose only to
gain.  God sometimes does try to the uttermost those whom He wishes
to bless.

The Deshseva Mandal of Sind has published a little pamphlet on
the economic condition of the Bhils of Sind.  It consists of two articles
written by Sjt. Jairamdas Doulatram after a careful study on the spot
of the condition of the Bhils living in Tharparker district of Sind.  The
tract is a desert. “The profession of agriculture in the desert“, writes
Sjt. Jairamdas,“is nothing but a stupenduous struggle against nature.”
“The average net yield of cultivation in that tract is not more than Rs.
5 per acre.  It is not every year that he (the cultivator) cultivates the
whole area.” “With a sandy soil, low rainfall, locust pest, and cheaply
priced crops, the khatedar1 can rarely keep his head above water.” “I
have come across all types of Bhils, those, very few ones, who are for
the time being out of debt, those who are in permanent debt and live a
semi-starved life and lastly those who are living in hopeless
pauperism.  I cannot do better than give to the reader a few hard facts
about specific villages.”2
These men should for years have revenue-free land.  It is for
people such as these that I pleaded for free salt and I know that at the
end of our discussions, it became a matter of pleasure for Lord Irwin
to make the concession regarding salt.  And I hope that the workers
throughout the land will bring the message of free salt to the semi-
starved villagers and discover all the salt areas which though not good
enough for mass production are good enough for village use.  It is to
these people that the charkha brings hope and happiness. Village
economics is different from industrial economics.  Human economics
is not the same as that of exploitation of mere dead matter.

Assam is in the grip of dire economic distress.  From everywhere, from
North Lakhimpur and Sibsagar, from Darrang and Nowgong, from Goal-           
para and Kamrup, come the tales of misery and woe of the ryots for this     
scarcity.  Hundreds of people, generally immigrants from Mymensingh,               
. . . have been flocking to the towns of Goalpara and Dhubri for begging, with
nothing to cover their loins excepting half-tattered pieces. . . .
In Goalpara and Sibsagar, Nowgong and North Lakhimpur there has been
repeated failure of crops owing to the annual visitation of floods for some
years past.  An earthquake also came in as another visitation in July last. . . .
Affected by this economic depression, from everywhere comes the cry
for remission of land revenue. . . .
It seems that the Government has not yet been able to shake off the
Civil Disobedience complex from their minds. . . . They have taken their
inability to pay land revenue to mean their unwillingness to do it and are
seeking to test it till the last day of kist by all sorts of indirect pressure. . . .
The foregoing report1 has been received from the Assam
Provincial Congress Committee.  If the report is accurate, and there is
no reason to doubt its accuracy, it is a clear case for remission.

438.  UNDER  SWARAJ
A Brahmin correspondent from Madras writes2 :
During his tour Sjt. Sen Gupta said that Swaraj Government would pass
legislation to crush Brahmins and also referred to resolutions of the Karachi
Congress.  On account of that the Brahmin minority has begun to be highly
restless and it has also created a sense of fear in the inds of the orthodox
Hindus.  Therefore please let me know what exactly you and the Congress
mean by
1.The words of the resolution dealing with untouchability.
2.What exactly you and the Congress mean by saying therein that under
the Swaraj Government the Government will observe religious neutra-lity. . . .
I do not believe Sjt. Sen Gupta said that Swaraj Government
would “crush the Brahmins”.  The congress resolution is clear.  The
1 Of which only excerpts are reproduced above
2 Only extracts are reproduced here.320       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcorrespondent is unnecessarily nervous about the future which lies as
much in his hands as in Sjt. Sen Gupta’s or mine.  Let it also be
remembered that the Congress resolution is not yet a part of the
constitution.  When it is, its interpretation will not rest with me or any
single individual.  It will rest with the courts duly established by law.
But I gladly give my opinion as to what is likely to be the
interpretation of the Congress resolution on religious neutrality and
untouchability.  It is bound to be a part of any future constitution as
there is no difference of opinion on it.  Indeed, even the correspo-
ndent seems to concede as much as the Congress wants.  Religious
neutrality means that the State will have no State religion nor a system
of favouritism.  There will be no untouchability.  The ‘untouchables’
will have the same rights as any other.  But a Brahmin will not be
made to touch anybody.  He will be free to make himself untouchable
and have his own well, his own temple, his own school and whatever
else he can afford, so long as he uses these things without being a
nuisance to his neighbours.  But he will not be able, as some do now,
to punish untouchables for daring to walk on public streets or using
wells.  There will be under swaraj no such scandal as that of the use of
public temples being denied to untouchables when it is allowed to all
other Hindus.  The authority of the Vedas and the other Shastras will
not be denied but their interpretation will not rest with individuals but
will depend upon the courts of law in so far as these religious books
will be used to regulate public conduct.  Conscientious scruples will be
respected, but not at the expense of public morals or the rights of
others. Those who will have extraordinary scruples will have
themselves to suffer inconvenience and pay for the luxury.  The law
will not tolerate any arrogation of superiority by any person or class
whether in the name of custom or religion.  But all this is my dream.
I am not the Congress.  Those who would have the Congress to do
otherwise had better make haste to join it and make others of their
opinion join it.  The Congress represents, or it has a constitution wide
enough to represent popular will.

June 11, 1931
Gandhiji, early this morning, addressed the Desh Sevikas for a few          
minutes, asking them to carry on picketing peacefully.  Only habitual wearers             
of khaddar should have the privilege of picketing.  If the audience had any                
stock of foreign cloth, they must consign them to the flames.  If they had mill-       
cloth, they must give them to the poor and the needy.  The object of khaddar             
was to help the starving peasants and workers who would obtain the full bene-              
fit of their labour if khadi was encouraged, while in the case of mill-cloth, they         
would receive only anna in the rupee.  To help the humanitarian cause, they must     
wear khaddar.

440.  SPEECH  AT  BOMBAY1
June 11, 1931
I must first apologize to you for having called you at this early
time.  The Hindustani Seva Dal stands for the service of India.  Till
now whenever I heard the term ‘Servant of India’ it used to rouse
great fear in my heart, because the rulers of India style themselves as
‘Servants of India’.  These so-called‘Servants of India’ can never in
reality be what they call themselves.They are the servants of the British
Empire and it is an impossibility to serve the British Empire and at the
same time serve India.  I can assure you, you can do no service to
India if you try to follow the workings of these so-called ‘Servants of
India’.  You have to develop a desire for real service which these
people totally lack.  If on acquiring power you begin to cruelly
enforce your authority on the people how is it possible to serve the
people?
It is because we lack this feeling of real service that a great deal
of rivalry and dissatisfaction has spread among ourselves.  It has
pained me very much to hear that out of a desire to attain high
positions in the various Congress bodies people have been spending
money, thus creating an atmosphere of unhealthy competition. The
real worker is he who carries on the work with a steady mind in spite
of his being in the furthermost rank. The perfection of real service
does not solely depend on the magnitude of the task done but rests a
1 To the campers of the Officer’s Training Camp of the Hindustani Seva Dal
who met Gandhiji at Mani Bhavan where Gandhiji used to stay while in Bombay.322       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIgreat deal on the humble spirit in which it is undertaken.Those
misguided people to whom I have referred desire by force, it seems, to
serve their country.  But it assuredly shows a most undesirable state of
mind.  One can never prosper or be capable of doing any good to
anybody if one adopts questionable means to attain that end.
It is decidedly wrong on my part to think that I shall be able        
to serve India better if I become King of India.  This was exactly         
the state of affairs at one time in the political life of France and       
people  used  to  employ  the  most  cruel  and  drastic  means  to
remove their opponents from the political field.  But the workers of
the Hindustani Seva Dal should work with Peace and Truth as their
foundation.
They must also cultivate to the greatest extent a sense of
humility nor must they ever relax their efforts or let the quality of the
work be in the least affected by feeling that there is not proper
appreciation.  They should deal with their fellow beings in a spirit of
fair tolerance and maintain a respectful reverence for their mothers
and sisters.  I know this perfect combination of humility—Truth, Love
and Peace—is very rare in this world, but you must all strive to attain
to it.  Remember there will be no soldiers left to fight if everybody
becomes a commander to give orders.  I sincerely hope that you will
try and live up to this ideal that I have portrayed for you at this most
precious time of the day and I can confidently say that if you
sincerely make an effort and keep the memory of this morning always
in your mind you will be doing the best service both to yourself and
to your motherland.

CHI.  JAMNADAS,
You are a strange man.  After having spent days with me here,
you go back and write from there a letter about an important matter.
It raises several questions.  Should I answer them by post, or call you
back here?  When I wanted to know why you thought of coming as
far as Bombay, you could give no answer and hurriedly went back,
and now you write to me a letter from there asking for Rs. 5,000.
This is now my advice to you.  Write to Kakasaheb and convince him
about the propriety of your request.  If you do this, my task will be
easier.  Have Manu and Babi reached there?

442.  INTERVIEW  TO  EUROPEAN  DEPUTATION
June 12, 1931
Gandhiji received a deputation of young Europeans, about 30 in number
including four ladies.  Gandhiji, at the request of the deputation, explained the attitude
of the Congress towards Englishmen and other Europeans in India.
Gandhiji said that the Congress attitude was not one of hostility to them, but
of active friendship.  He recalled to them how the Congress was started by an
Englishman, Mr. Hume, and was presided over by even members of Parliament.  He
wanted them to study the object and history of the Congress, which never meant any
harm to any community or interests.  If they sympathized with the Congress it was
their duty to join it.  In India it was but natural that Indians should have full rights to
rule as Englishmen had in their own country.  It was not reasonable for Englishmen to
ask for safeguards and trading rights of a special character on which they were
insisting.  Perpetuation of these privileges, which they had carved in their 150 years
of rule in India, would amount to friendship on unequal terms.  The Congress was not
merely not hostile to Englishmen, but welcome their association, assistance and co-
operation and their organizing capacity.  Co-operation of such a kind did not mean
co-operation on unequal terms. The deputation waited on Gandhiji for about 15
minutes.
The Hindu , 12-6-1931324       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI443.  SPEECH  AT  MAROLI1
June 12, 1931
Mahatma Gandhi laid the foundation of the building of a Weaving School,
started by Miss Mithubehn Petit.  Addressing a big public meeting, he said that if he
had been told ten years ago that Miss Mithubehn Petit, who belonged to a celebrated
Parsi family of Bombay, would roam day and night in the villages barefooted and
dressed in coarse khaddar, regardless of the heat and cold, to work among the poor
people and teach their children spinning, weaving and other industries, he (Mr.
Gandhi) would not have believed it.  Althought he had appreciated the work of Parsis,
even when the campaign of prohibition was launched, he had thought that
prohibition alone would not succeed without propagation of khaddar.  The closing of
liquor shops was not the principal   thing.  If drunkards did not give up the habit of
drink, they would prepare illicit liquor and there would be illicit sale of liquor as at
present.  Drunkards would not give up drink till they were taught some industry.
Workers working in big factories required something to be relieved of the fatigue.
The speaker, who had never tasted liquor, had affectionately given liquor to the
exhausted in South Africa.  The Kolis, who were with him, demanded liquor, and the
speaker brought liquor from a canteen-keeper and gave it to them.  Men who were
made to work like beasts would require liquor, but those working in a peaceful
atmosphere in their homes could easily give up drink.
If rural industries like spinning, weaving, dairying, shoe-making, etc., were
revived, rural areas would become richer.  They did not want to be rich like the
millionaires of the Bombay Stock Exchange but they should get rid of their debts.
There would be a few silver coins in their cash boxes.  Instead of borrowing money
from sowcars,   they should deposit their savings with sowcars.  They would have
then houses of their own, and the number of their cattle would increase.  Such a
process was going on in the area, and it should go on in the seven lakhs of villages in
India.  This was the work of swaraj.  Last year, they had done the work of cleansing
the field.  Now they had to do the work of sowing.  That was constructive work.  The
sowing work was of greater importance and had to be done for a longer time.

BORSAD,
June 13, 1931
DEAR  MR.  EMERSON,
You must have seen from the papers that Khan Abdul Ghaffar
Khan has been with me for some time.  During the few moments that I
could spare for him from day to day, I carried on my conversations
with him and he has left on me the impression that he is a truthful and
out and out believer in non-violence.  He has no connection with the
Amanullah  movement.  His work is solely concentrated upon the
Khudai Khidmatgar movement.  This movement consists in enlisting
men for service.  The following pledge is administered to them: “I
shall be truthful, I shall be chaste, I shall be non-violent and not
quarrel with my neighbours. I shall not covet my neighbours’ pro-
perty. I shall be prepared to suffer even unto death for the freedom of
the country.” Those who take the pledge and enlist themselves as
Khudai Khidmatgars are expected to   attend a weekly roll call in their
respective villages.  He is most emphatic in his declar-ation that there
has been on the part of himself and his followers no breach of the
Settlement and he says that he has everywhere preached to the people
the necessity for carrying out its terms in so far as they are applicableVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      331to the people.  But he says there are several breaches of the Settlement
on the part of the officials and he relates the following :
(a) Many civil disobedience prisoners are not yet discharged in
the Frontier Province including the Agency areas.
(b)He says that the people are being molested on the slightest
pretext.  The soldiers as they pass the villagers’ houses cry “Islam
Murdabad”, “Gandhi Murdabad”, “Ghaffar Khan Murdabad”, and
he adds that he has prohibited among his followers all objectionable
cries.
Khan Saheb admits that he did not visit the Commissioner        
and he says he refrained because he saw no change in the attitude          
of local officials and if he went, he was afraid of his being mis-
represented.  He is quite prepared to see you or His Excellency the
Viceroy provided I accompany him.  I do feel that you should          
make his acquaintance, and if you think it worth while I shall         
gladly visit Simla solely for the purpose of introducing him to        
you.  I think that the Settlement presumes mutual trust and it will
therefore perhaps be wise on the part of the Government to know
Khan Saheb personally and then test his assurances.  Pending reply to
this letter I have detained Khan Saheb.  As he has been long enough
with me and as I do not want to detain him longer than is absolutely
necessary, I would ask you please to send me a telegraphic reply. I
should add that Khan Saheb is most insistent on my visiting the
Frontier Province and seeing things for myself, making the
acquaintance of the numerous Khudai Khidmatgars and studying his
activity.  I do feel that there should be no objection now to my visiting
the Frontier Province.1

DEAR  MR.  DAVID,
I have now thought out a formula and here it is :
To provide a common platform for those Europeans and
Indians who stand for the speedy creation of a system of Government
which will enable India to take her rightful place among the free
nations of the world.
The phrase “among the free nations of the world” takes the
place of “as a fellow member of the British Commonwealth of free
nations” in the original. You will see that this formula does not
exclude British connection in the shape of equal partnership at will.
Nor does it necessarily include it.  I do not say much of the other two
formulae.
Yours sincerely,

I have your letter1 for which there was no occasion for apology.
You have an ambitious programme.  But with faith and application
there is no reason why you should not go through it.
I am glad that Matibas and Pur Bai are with you. It is a

greatest asset. I need not worry about reading your budget as Jamna-

DEAR  MR.  DAVID,
I dictated a letter last night.  Mahadev had handed me another
letter from you of 11th instant in which you ask me whether I approve
of the suggestion contained in the letter in connection with the
proposed non-official conciliation committee to be formed under the
auspices of the Mayor of Bombay. I would like to make one
suggestion. It would be bet-ter not to have a rigid rule fixing a
proportion between the numbers of Indians and Europeans.1 It would
be better to adopt the natural method.  It may be you will have more
earnest Europeans than Indians to work on the Committee.  In that
event I should not hesitate to take more and   vice versa .

DEAR  FRIEND,
I have your letter.  Some time when I am in Bombay you should
try to see me.  It is difficult to advise you in the matter of food just
now.  It is necessary to see you and cross-question you.  Will you not
see some naturopath in Bombay?  Mr. Khambhatta of Hornby Road
knows one and he has benefited by his treatment.  His full address is
Bairam Khambhatta, 275 Hornby Road, Fort Bombay.
It is difficult to say how many hours’ sleep a particular
individual requires, but I can safely say for you that you should take
as much sleep as you comfortably can.  And you should take daily
walks in the morning and in the evening.  Once only is not enough.
If you have the strength, you should take really three or four hours’
walk.  You may divide it, if you like, in two or three periods.
You ask me what should be one’s ideal in life.  All the sages in
the world have said—self-realization.
The rumour about the burning of my foot was quite wrong.  It
would have been more correct if the report had said I had very
narrowly1 escaped burning my foot.

BORSAD,
June 14, 1931
DEAR  MR.  EMERSON,
Your letter enclosing an unsigned opinion of the Legislative
Department on the meaning of the word “return” in the Settlement
came upon me as a bomb shell.1 I was wholly unprepared for such an
opinion. I had flattered myself with the belief that my knowledge of
law had not become absolutely rusty. But the opinion of your legal
department shook what little confidence I had yet in my legal
knowledge. I therefore hastened to refer the matter to the best counsel
available in Bombay at the present moment. I am sending you a copy
of their opinion.2 The first two signatories are ex-Advocates-General
of Bombay and they are both today, as is also the third, distinguished
practising lawyers. For the moment therefore my confidence is
restored, but that can be of no avail to you. I can quite understand
your not accepting the opinion of Bombay lawyers however eminent
they may be, in the teeth of opinion from your legal department
however contrary to common sense. I, therefore, suggest what I have
suggested of the Government of Bombay. As the matter involved is
one of principle for the Management of the Navajivan Press, I would
repeat the suggestion I have made to the Government of Bombay that
the Chief Justice of Bombay should be appointed sole arbitrator in the
matter. The Managing Board is naturally anxious to end this
controversy and also to avoid a continuing loss that the deprivation of
the press causes to them. I hope therefore that the matter will be
finished one way or the other without delay.
This impasse brings to me a matter of general importance.           
I am having, as I imagine, more trouble than I have told you from the
Bombay Government in connection with the matters arising out of the
Settlement. And there is trouble growing in the Madras Presidency
over liquor picketing.  Here is an extract from Syt. Rajagopalachari
whose instructions on this very point you  had seen and which you so
admired that you asked me to congratulate  him :
1 The opinion was that the phrase “will be returned” would mean “possession
will be restored” and that the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was silent on the question of the place
of delivery.
2 Vide “Opinion”, 13-6-1931338       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHII had hitherto refrained from worrying you.  The Government here are
beginning to feel that peaceful picketing is not so harmless as they had
imagined.  They have discovered that it does stop drinking most effectively
and as a result the revenue is threatened.  They may hold renters to their
contracts this year, but what about the next auction?  They see that without
any physical obstruction or coercion of any kind, picketing does keep people
away from the shops. 
The renters too espected that like last year the congress activities would
soon be interfered with by the police and so they did not themselves do
anything at first to interfere with the volunteers.  But now they realize that the
Truce has put an end to the old order to things.  They are consequently in a
fright.  They have begun to make strong representations to Government
demanding either police interference or writing off of dues.  Both Government
officials and renters are thus opening their eyes to the reality of the moral
power of picketing and the implications of the Truce.  Both Government
officials and renters have, therefore, it seems, resolved on new tactics.  There
is almost by concerted action a number of cases cropping up everywhere of
rowdyism to intimidate volunteers.  Besides rowdyism, which might be
expected, the renters whether instigated or encouraged by officials or not, I
cannot yet say, are bringing up false charges through private complaints in
order to get fines and imprisonments imposed on the workers and
sympathizers and worry and tire out the Congress organizations.  And
magistrates, too, imagine that they should support the liquor-shop men.
Further, even where they know the cases are false, they dare not expose
themselves to the suspicion that they favour the Congress and do not support
the revenue.
Local police authorities have begun to harass and interfere with the
picketing.  Finding that there is no sort of coercion or disturbance of the
peace, and that they cannot legitimately object to the picketing, they are
trying other ways.  They are making demonstrations of police force, pushing
the volunteers away to impossible distances from the shops and from each
other and demanding the observance of conditions that reduce picketing to an
ineffectual farce.  Local police authorities are permitted to terrorize town and
village folk and proclaim that any assistance or harbouring of Congress
volunteers would amount to abetment of offenders.  In fact, the 1930
atmosphere is being sought to be brought about.
I have conscientiously tried to put the best construction on all that
Government officials are doing.  But I am afraid I must confess failure.  If you
have time, please go through the enclosures.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      339You might be unable to interfere with the working or not
working of the Settlement by local governments.  Or your interfer-
ence may not go far enough according to my view of the Settlement.
Time has therefore perhaps arrived for the appointment of a perm-
anent Board of Arbitration to decide question of interpretation of the
Settlement and as to the full carrying out of the terms by the one
party or the other. I would therefore like you to consider this
suggestion.
Yours sincerely,

From a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 3414340       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI465.  INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS
BORSAD,
June 14, 1931
Interviewed by a representative of the Associated Press, Mahatma Gandhi said
he aarrived at Borsad principally to console the people of Ras who were perturbed
over the continuous destruction of their hedges and stray assaults committed by
Dharalas.  They suspected that Dharalas had been emboldened by the continuance as
the village headman of a Dharala who is an exconvict.  Gandhiji had already asked for
the cancellation of his appointment on two grounds in terms of the Delhi Settlement :
one was that he was undesirable and the other was that his appointment was not
permanent in the terms of the Delhi Settlement.  He had also asked for protection of
the non-Dharala population of Ras village.  Both matters were engaging the attention
of the Collector of Kaira District.  There were other matters, too, which required his
personal attention.  He thought he need not go into these matters at present.  Asked
how long he would stay at Borsad, Gandhiji said as soon as he had finished his work
he had instructions from Sardar Vallabhbhai to go to Bardoli which he would do.
In reply to a question whether it was true, as stated by his son Mr. Devdas at
last night’s public meeting, that he intended shortly to visit the Frontier Province,
Gandhiji said it was perfectly true that Abdul Ghaffar Khan was pressing him to visit
that province.  He was equally anxious to go there and see for himself how far the
spirit of non-violence had prevailed among tribes inhabiting that province, but
whilst the Truce lasted he did not want to do anything, as far as possible, that might
embarrass Government.  He was therefore in correspondence with Government on the
matter.  Asked how long Abdul Ghaffar Khan would stay with him, Gandhiji said he
would stay pending the results of the correspondence between him and Government.

MY  DEAR  MOHANLAL,
I got your letter only today.  I could not therefore discuss it with
Jawaharlal.
In spite of what the D.C. says, I hold that my message1 to the
kisans is no breach of the Settlement.
It was never the intention that each kisan’s money should be
separately deposited.  If such was the suggestion, I have forgotten all
about it.  The object is that the kisans should not use up the money
that might have been saved for payment of rent.
I did receive Balkrishna’s wire. You will have noticed the
correction2.  It was a silly slip.
Just at present it is difficult for me to leave Gujarat.  The things
are looking none too bright here.  On your side itis all well, so long as
you hold the kisans in check.  But Jawaharlal’s presence must now
ease the situation.  He has no difficulty in dealing with the kisans and
restraining them.
In any event please keep me informed of the happenings there.

471.  INTERVIEW  TO  ASSOCIATED  PRESS
BORSAD,
June 15, 1931
Interviewed by a representative of the Associated Press regarding the
controversy in respect of his services in the Boer War, Mahatma Gandhi said :
The Indian Ambulance Corps numbering over 1,100 reached
Chieveley camp near Colenso after dusk just after the battle in which
Lieutenant Roberts was killed. I received orders from Col.  Gallwey
that the deceased Lieutenant’s body had to be immediately removed.
We had then hardly pitched the tents.  
I sent seven men, not “coolies”, but educated men, who
returned late at night and I received special thanks from Col. Gallwey
for the prompt attention and was next day invited through Dr. Booth
to meet him in his tent.
It is quite true that on this occasion there was no question of
firing line, hostilities having been suspended for the collection of the
wounded.  It is also true that despite our desire to work under fire, we
were told that we would not be allowed to do so but after the reversea
at Spion Kop, the situation became grave.

firing zone in order to remove nearly 60 wounded from the foot of
Spion Kop.  My companions and I were delighted to have this privi-
lege and led by Major Bapty, we crossed the pontoon, entered firing
zone and removed the wounded including General Woodgate, Major
Scott Moncrief and other officers and carried them on stretchers 25
miles.
We were again within the firing zone at Vaal Kantz soon after
Kop.  For these and general services I was mentioned in General
Buller’s dispatch and with over 20 leaders was recipient of a War
Medal.

BORSAD,
June  16,  1931
I have your long letter.  You will see the use I have made of it
from the copy herewith enclosed.1
I feel that all the questions now outstanding have got to be
referred to some board of arbitration and, if the Central Government
want to play the game, as I think they do, they would accept my
suggestion for the appointment of such a board.  There may be some
modification as to the board, but the principle, I think, they will
accept.  Do you suggest anything more to be done in this direction?
Till the final answer is received, you should not embark upon any
heroic measure.   But I agree with you that if we do not get anything
whatsoever, we have a perfect right to take such measures as we like
including local and specific civil disobedience in so far as it may be
necessary to resist lawlessness on the part of unscrupulous officials.
I want you  to study carefully the article2 I have written for the
forthcoming issue of Young India on the Working Committee
resolution.  I do not like it.  At the same time from its own stand-point
the Working Committee’s position could be justified.  The alternativ I
had suggested was much better.  Some of those who voted with the
majority, I think, even saw the point.  But you will critically read the

alternative has to be enforced in the event of failure of our demand at
the Conference.

BORSAD,
June 17, 1931
MY  DEAR  ANAND,
I hear all about you regularly through Mirabehn and
occasionally through Jairamdas.  I know that you are refraining from
writing to me purely out of pity for me.
I should not consider father’s letter disappointing.  I think that
he took up the correct position.  But Jairamdas tells me that later he
modified his view.  I think that it is a sound rule for people who are
well-to-do not to go to their friends living in public institutions except
when they are ready to make a grant to those institutions at least equal
to what their visit to such institutions might have cost them.  It need
not be done offensively and can be done gracefully.  If father had
simply come or sent your mother or your sister and asked them
quietly to slip into your pocket a hundred-rupee note, it would have
been still more correct.
You must not be or feel feeble either in body or in mind.
Nothing has to be done beyond your resolute to feel weak.  There was
no foot-burn to the healed.  The whole thing was a creation of the
reporters’ imagination.
It is good for Vidya1 to continue the diet of milk and fruit and
even fruit alone if milk disagrees, till she has a real hunger and
appetite for other food.  But if she can go to Bombay for treatment
under a nature-cure expert, it would, of course, be better.

get in touch with the Chief Commissioner of North West Frontier Province rather
than to visit Simla.”VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      351481. SUBSTANCE NOT SHADOW
The public are entitled to know why after having made repeated
declarations to the contrary the Working Committee had passed the
resolution1 requiring me (other conditions being favourable) to attend
the Round Table Conference, if thereto required, for the presentation
of the Congress position.
Ordinarily a member of the Working Committee could not tell
the public of discussions behind its resolutions, their defeated amend-
ments or counter resolutions. But in the present case the Working
Committee has made an exception and authorized me to take the
public into confidence in order that I might clear my position and
also explain that of the Working Committee.
It was my essentially democratic nature which, in spite of my
very strong objection, impelled me to submit to the resolution. One
may not make a principle of every objection and, if not carried, block
the way by threatening to retire from an institution or by refusing
submission to the opinion of the majority. I therefore fought the
Working Committee, reminded it of my repeated public and private
declarations and moved informally a resolution myself which I
thought was far more consistent and desirable in the national interest.
But I could not carry with me the majority who thought that not to
attend the Conference by reason of the failure of a communal
settlement would be to play into the hands of the enemy and expose
the Committee to unnecessary misrepresentation.
Though there is much to be said for the majority view,
I regard mine to be safer and more truly in consonance with
the Lahore resolution on the communal question.2 There was, in my
opinion, sound reasoning behind my declaration that I should
not attend the Round Table Conference if there was no agreed
settlement of the communal question. Absence of it would mean
1 On June 9. It read: “The Working Committee hope that the efforts that are
now being made to secure honourable and satisfactory settlement of the communal
problem will meet with success. The Committee is of opinion that, even should these
efforts unfortunately fail, in order to avoid any possibility of the Congress attitude
being misunderstood in any shape or form, other conditions being favourable,
Mahatma Gandhi should represent the Congress at the R.T.C., if thereto required, for
the presentation of the Congress position.”
2 Vide “Speech at subjects Committee, A.I.C.C.- III”, 1-1-1930352       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIabsence of unity and absence of unity would deprive the national
demand of the strength required to secure its acceptance.
My proposition therefore before the Working Committee was
that agreed settlement failing, the Congress should give up the hope of
winning a swaraj constitution by the way of the present Round Table
Conference and should wait till all the communities were satisfied to
adopt a purely national solution. The Congress could meanwhile
further consolidate its position and work with greater concentration
for the masses including all the communities and thus make the toilers
of all the other communities regard the Congress as theirs as the
Hindus do.
This does not mean giving up the struggle for freedom.
It all depends upon what we mean by and want through purna
swaraj. If we mean an awakening among the masses, a knowledge
among them of their true interest and ability to serve that interest
against the whole world and if through purna swaraj we want
harmony, freedom from aggression from within or without and a
progressive improvement in the economic condition of the masses, we
can gain our end without political power and by directly acting upon
the powers that be. One form of direct action is adult suffrage. The
second and more potent form is satyagraha. It can easily be shown
that whatever is needful and can be gained by political power can
perhaps be more quickly and more certainly gained by satyagraha. If
such is the case and if, in spite of all, [the] attempt to secure an
honourable settlement of the communal question fails it is obvious
that we should give up the attempt to secure a swaraj constitution at
the present moment. It is better and quicker to wait till the Congress
has become equally popular with the other communities than to
attempt to force swaraj through highly artificial surroundings. If the
Congress means what it says, it cannot be long gaining the adherence
of all the other communities. Meanwhile the Congress must fulfil its
mission of representing the starving millions by fighting for their
relief, if it cannot do so by gaining power then by gaining that relief
through the government existing at the moment. Whilst discussing this
probability with English friends, I was reminded that this position was
hardly fair, not to take the power to make the reforms and to force the
hands of those who cannot carry on the administration if they grant
the reforms, in their opinion only so called. I pointed out the fallacy
underlying the rebuke. The Congress is ever ready to take the powerVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      353if it is given to it but the Congress is too weak to seize power from
unwilling hands in the artificial surroundings of the Round Table
Conference and that in the absence of real unity between the chief
actors, the communities.
The Congress wants the substance not the shadow. It can there-
fore wait for the shadow of power, it cannot wait for the substance of
freedom which the dumb millions so badly need and can understand.
I have placed before the public the main part of the argument I
placed before the Working Committee. It failed to convince its
majority. It may fail therefore to convince too the majority of the
public. Nevertheless my position will probably be the same as now if
and when the Conference fails to meet the Congress position.
But having accepted the resolution of the Working Com-mittee,
I shall faithfully carry it out and work at the Conference with all
possible zeal, if I am destined to attend it. I should not reject real
power if it is real. I should put my whole soul into working for it. But
I have wisdom and patience enough to wait for it if necessary and
know that such waiting may be a process of hastening.

The head master of Tilak Vidyalaya thus rebukes me:1
I gladly publish the letter if only to advertise the very good
work of the national school of Nagpur. As for the Tilak University, I
am not sure that I omitted to mention it on the occasion referred to.
My speech was not previously prepared. It had to be delivered
extempore. Whatever names I took were merely illustrative and not
exhaustive. I can certainly recall many national institutions which
rendered great service during the struggle. My object was to show the
very marked contrast between the Government institutions and the
national ones and to show that every anna spent in the latter was an
anna spent for swaraj. I showed too that in the nature of things it
1 The letter is not reproduced here.  It complained of Gandhiji’s failure, in his
speech at Gujarat Vidyapith (vide “Speech at Convocation, gujarat Vidyapith,
Ahmedabad”, 11-4-1931), to mention the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapith of Poona and
the Tilak Vidyalaya of Nagpur and their contribution  to  civil   disobedience 
movement;   vide   also, “Letter   to  M. G. Datar”, 26-5-1931354       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIcould not be otherwise. However badly managed the Congress may
be, it is still that and that alone which can usher in swaraj and not a
Government department. It is once more a question of swadeshi v.
videshi1. The English paraphrase is: ‘a good Government is no
substitute for self-Government’.

483. COLOUR BAR IN EDINBURGH
The Honorary Secretary, Edinburgh Indian Association, writes:
It will be recalled that in 1927 all the cafes, restaurants and dance halls,
imposed the colour ban, but after representations being made to various
authorities a compromise was reached and soon after the ban was raised, again
this year two cafes in Edinburgh have renewed the colour ban. These two cafes
(Strand Cafe and Cafeteria) refuse to admit coloured students as a whole without
any reasons. Edinburgh Indian Association approached the Lord Provost of
Edinburgh and the Students’ Representative Council of Edinburgh University,
but so far no action has been taken by them and the colour ban still continues.
The Hon. Secretary does not say why the two Cafes have
restored the ban or why it was originally introduced. Denial of the use
of refreshment rooms in the West is an inconvenience of which we in
India can have no adequate conception. Intense public agitation is the
only way to deal with this prejudice. The Edinburgh Indian Associa-
tion will do well to supply the public with full facts.

It was a good sign that at the same time as the Tamil Nadu
Conference a Hindi Prachar Conference too was held. The people of
the Southern Presidency are under promise to send for the next year
Congress delegates who would speak and understand Hindi. If we
were not living in artificial conditions, the people living in the South
will not consider the learning of Hindi as a strain on them, much less a
superfluity. It is surely more necessary for them to learn Hindi than
for the Hindi-speaking population to learn the Southern languages.
There are two speaking and understanding Hindi against one speaking
the Southern languages in all India. There must be for all India a
common language of inter-provincial contact in addition to, not in
the place of, the provincial language or languages. It can only be
Hindi-Hindustani. Some who altogether dismiss the masses from their
minds would regard English not merely as an alternative but the only
possible medium. This proposition would be unthinkable but for the
hypnotic influence of foreign domination. For the masses of the
South who must take an ever-growing part in national affairs, what can
be easier—learning Hindi which has many words in common with
their languages and which at once gives them access practically to the
whole of the North or learn English a wholly foreign tongue spoken
only by a select few? The choice really depends upon one’s concep-
tion of swaraj. If it is to be of and for only the English-knowing
Indians, English is undoubtedly the common medium. If it is to be for
and of the starving millions, of the illiterate millions, of the illiterate
women, of the suppressed untouchables, Hindi is the only possible
common language. Those who think like me will therefore welcome
the report of the great progress made by Hindi during the past twelve
years of the existence of organized propaganda. Here is the record of
work during the period:
Number of those who have taken to the study of Hindi                                     4,00,000
,,,, ,, acquired a working knowledge

tions, one through 12.)

,, teachers trained so far                                               250
Total funds raised and spent so far Rs. 2,50,000
,, ,, ,, from North India Rs. 1,55,000
,, ,, ,, from South India Rs.     95,000
Let us hope that during this year of grace the progress will
be still more rapid and that the finance will be found wholly by the
South. It will be a test of the desire of the South to learn the national
language and to make India one indivisible whole.

485. NOTES
SWARAJ FOR CEYLON
A Ceylon correspondent asks the following strange questions1:
I do not know that Ceylon is a bankrupt island or that it is
necessarily bankrupt because it does not manufacture all its own cloth
or grow all the grains it eats. But assuming that Ceylon is as the
correspondent describes, it has2 all the greater reason for being free.
Possibly Ceylon’s economic condition is bad, if it is bad, because of
its dependence. I cannot conceive of a single occasion when slavery or
dependence can be preferable to swaraj or freedom.
So far as India’s help is concerned, when India is free, whether
she will or no, her freedom will automatically spur Ceylon to
1 Not reproduced here. The first question was whether an economically depen-
dent country should seek swaraj; and secondly, whether India would help Ceylon in
attaining freedom.

mean more freedom to her neighbours and even other countries in the
East as her slavery or dependence means a hindrance to their growth.
Disease among neighbours can never be an advantage. And a diseased
continent like India must be a perpetual menace to her neighbours.
Dependence is perhaps the greatest disease. Mere physical illness is
any day preferable to the illness of the soul. The latter brings in its
train all kinds of physical afflictions and worse.
Young India, 18-6-1931
486. JAPANESE OR BRITISH?
That from the economic standpoint (and that is the only
standpoint important for the millions) boycott of Japanese cloth is
much the most important is clear from the following letter1 from Sjt.
H. P. Modi, President, Bombay Mill-owners’ Association.
If therefore there is any laxity on the part of boycott workers,
they will remember that emphasis on boycott of British cloth would be
of no avail whatsoever from the economic viewpoint. Incidentally one
can see how British cloth has been hit by Japanese cloth.

I trust your truthful nature too well to be shocked by anything

discuss the thing today. There is no hurry. Perhaps the things will be
clear because of your search and because of your promise to do what
I have advised for the sake of discipline though not from conviction.
Often an honest acceptance of discipline has brought conviction. And
so may it be with you. You did well in writing to me so frankly.
Let me correct one belief of yours about me. You say, “I know
that you are too pure for sex-consciousness yourself.” I wish this was
a true certificate. I am sorry to have to disillusion you. I am trying to
lose that consciousness. But I have not lost it. Loss of that

Shah Mangaldas Harilal Gandhi, Fanaswadi, 2nd Lane, Dadi-

Shah Harilal Maneklal Gandhi’s son. One Surajbehn regarded Shri
Harilal as her father. He has all her money. His present condition
cannot be described as good. Surajbehn tells me that at one time it was
very good. I have written to Shri Harilal and told him that it was not at
all proper to keep a widow’s money in a private firm, and that he
should deposit it in the Bank of India and send Surajbehn a receipt in
her name. I enclose his reply. It is possible that there is no risk about
the money. But I feel worried. Request Shri Mangaldas to see you, or
you yourself should call on him, and ask him what the position is. Get
all the facts and see if you can persuade him to deposit the money in
the Bank. It is to be deposited in Surajbehn’s name. Her jewellery is
also in their custody. If possible, get that, too, in your possession, or
secure the Safe Deposit receipts for it, which are in their possession.
You will not immediately require a letter of authority from Surajbehn.
But wire to me if you require one and I will send it. In any case
arrange to see Mangaldas immediately.

494. LETTER TO PRESIDENT, CONGRESS COMMITTEE,
TIRUTTANI 1
[Before June 19, 1931 ]2
Gandhiji has asked picketers not to disobey the order as that would amount to a
breach of the Truce terms on the part of Congress, but he promises to correspond with
the Home Secretary, Government of India.
Meanwhile Gandhiji has asked Tiruttani Congressmen to send him a copy of
the order and details regarding picketing movement in Tiruttani.

BORSAD,
June 19, 1931
DEAR MR. EMERSON,
Here are copies of letters received by Syts. Morarji Desai and
Durlabhji Desai, ex-Deputy Collectors for both of whom the Central
Government had advised the Bombay Government to give pension or
gratuity in lieu of pension. You will remember that this was arranged
because you had suggested to Lord Irwin that it would be embarras-
sing for Provincial Governments to restore officials of high rank to
their original position. I remember your having told me during our
conversations in Simla1 that the Bombay Government had difficulty
about giving anything to the two officials concerned. But I was
unprepared for the letter according to the enclosed copy. Both these
gentlemen had applied not for grace but in terms of the Settlement.
May I therefore ask you to advise the Bombay Government to carry
out the Settlement in respect of these two officials?

DEAR MR. EMERSON,
I do not know whether you obtained legal opinion regarding
confiscated guns. Complaints are being received from many places
that these guns are not being restored. In most of these cases, so far as
I can see, the guns were possessed for defending owners and their pro-
perty against wild beasts. I have several such cases from Karnatak.

DEAR CAPTAIN BARNES1,
I thank you for your very full letter. I was sorry to learn that
your health had broken down, I hope however that you will be
completely restored very soon. Your letter was redirected to me from
Sabarmati and so I got it just after Khan Saheb had left me. He was
with me quite a few days and for the first time I came in intimate
contact with him. My experience of him is that he is a very sober and
truthful man believing implicitly in non-violence. Your letter however
gives a different picture of him. As he is still within reach I am
sending a friend with a copy of your letter for explanation and if
there is anything further to tell you I shall write again. Could you
please send me a copy of the drama referred to by you with
translation or without, if you cannot easily send me a translation.
Yours sincerely,

Private               A S AT
SABARMATI ,
June 19, 1931
MY DEAR CHARLIE,
I have your two letters, both of them quite like you. Here is my
answer to the moral questions you have placed. It is perfectly true that
I would have prohibition of foreign cloth by one blow if I could
manage it and would not feel that there was the slightest trace of
violence in it. At this conclusion I arrived in 1889 and ‘90 when I was
studying in London and keenly following the controversy between
1  Sub-Divisional Officer for the Charsadda sub-division of Peshawar District in
1930; he wrote to Gandhiji on June 14, 1931 describing Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s
speeches as “inflammatory”.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      365total prohibitionists and temperance reformers. The former were led
by Sir Wilfred Lawson who contended that all public houses could be
closed without any compensation being paid to the keepers. The
temperance party which was really the party financed by the public-
house keepers put up a strong and successful fight for compensation
and graduation. If a man is making a living out of wrongdoing he
gains no prescriptive right and therefore is entitled to no compen-
sation or consideration when his business is stopped whether by the
‘State or by his customers refusing to deal with him. It is irrelevant to
consider what would happen to the many labourers who might be
engaged unconsciously in helping the wrongdoer. The assumption at
the back of this argument is that wrong must be righted at any cost
and that the harm that may temporarily seem to result to the
wrongdoer and his dependents is only apparent and that in the end he
and they are all the better for it. If such was not the case, many a
reform would become impossible. Of course it is open to you to say
that you will not put foreign-cloth trade on a level with liquor or
opium trade. But this is a matter of opinion.
If I was bolstering up the Bombay mills in any shape or form it
would undoubtedly be violence. But my conscience is quite clear on
that point. I am not only not bolstering up the Indian mills but I am
fighting them in many matters. My intervention has resulted in steady
improvement of the conditions of labour. If these mills interfered with
khaddar I should desire their boycott just as strongly as that of
foreign mills.
The remedy for unemployment in England is not thoughtless
generosity of India but a complete realization by England of the
awfulness of exploitation of people, violently brought under subjec-
tion by her, and consequent radical changes in her conception of the
standard of life and a return to simplicity. Has generosity, in respect
of a man more fortunate than himself, any meaning for the man who
is living in a state of chronic starvation?
The South African analogy you have quoted is improper. What
you regard as generous action was really necessary action in terms of
non-violence. In order to show that my fight was not intended to
embarrass the Government or to seize power I was bound in
pursuance of non-violence to suspend the struggle1 in order to show
1 In 1914, during the European railway workers’ strike; vide “Interview to
“Pretoria News” “, 9-1-1914366       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthat I had no sympathy with the Europeans who were bent on
embarrassing the Government to the point of making it so powerless
as to enable them to seize the reins themselves. Occasions here for
what you would call generosity occurred at the time of the Delhi
Settlement1 and are occurring whilst the Settlement is being worked
and it would delight your heart if you knew how every such occasion
has been fully availed of. And even with reference to the present
unemployment in England, many a generous gesture is possible but
none is possible if it means continuance of injury to India or fresh
injury. If England ceased to think imperially, if India came to her own
and instead of being a dependency of England became a real partner
or ally, England could get preferential treatment in hundreds of
things, which an awakened India on her road to prosperity would
require from the West. If therefore Lancashire cannot keep all its
labour going through spinning and weaving mills working for other
markets, it should find out some other use for it. Lastly, remember
that even if there was no boycott of foreign cloth and open
competition Japan would outdistance Lancashire as it is already doing.
I have your cable. Of course if I came to London my movement
will be in your hands and I would gladly go to Lancashire as early as
you would want me to.
I quite agree with you that your name should remain in the
background as much as possible.
What undignified controversy over my part in the Boer War. I
had to give the facts to Reuter & The Statesman2.

I thank you for your letter1 of the 18th instant.
You may publish any of my correspondence. I am glad that the
lady2 says that there is no ground now for complaint. But I cannot
help repeating in fairness to the parties complained against that they
have never admitted the charges made against them and they have
courted the fullest inquiry. My own position has always been never to
bolster up such charges because I have found by experience that large
movements like ours can only be kept pure by exposing every
weakness among workers.

BORSAD,
June 19, 1931
CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your letters. I understand what you say about Dwarkanath.
I am in correspondence with him.
We should not pay the premiums on Sorabji’s policy. I see little
possibility of our getting back the original sum. I can think of no
remedy against this.
Has Jamna completely recovered now? Was it that she took too
large a dose of the medicine through mistake, or was it the fault of the
vaid?
Panditji wanted to talk to me about the students. He believes that
the arrangement by which Premabehn teaches Gujarati is not right. It
is not sufficient either. He, therefore, requested that Shivabhai should
be employed. You acceded to the request but put him in the office.
He had also much to say against Premabehn’s temper. The
reading-room remains closed while she is in it, so much so that it is
not opened even for Maganbhai. After hearing all this, I merely said
that, if I inter-vened in the Ashram affairs just now, it would amount to
my living in it, but that, when necessary, I might give some guidance.
I, therefore, advised him to discuss the whole matter with you and
solve the problem. I think you should have a frank talk with him. He
is a straight forward man. If he has not talked to you about all this,
you should use this letter and discuss the matter with him and reassure
him. You may consult me if necessary.
Champa must have arrived there today. I have advised her to
stay in the Ashram. If she does not do that, let her stay in the red
bungalow or anywhere else. Some special arrangement will have to be
made about Shashi’s education. It would be best if you could secure
the services of a good lady teacher. Consult Kakasaheb. Savitabehn,
too, may be able to guide you. Balvant, Champa’s brother, wants to be
permitted to live in the Ashram. I have told him that he may do so if
he agrees to obey the rules. He is also eager to stay with Krishnan
Nair. I have written to him.

CHI. GANGABEHN,
I had your letter. Take Indu under your loving care. That boy is
pining away without his mother. The thing is that you should, like a
mother, keep a watchful eye on all boys and girls. To any woman who
wishes to serve as a mother, they are her children. Many women may
act as mothers to the same children. If, therefore, any other woman
feels such love in her heart, we should be happy about it. It is but right
that she should feel such love. At any rate you should try to awaken it
in other women.
Whenever you feel upset and worried, let me know. Never lose
heart. Try and get to know personally the men and women who have
recently joined. Remember that you are also a member of the
Managing Committee.
You have taken a rather difficult vow in regard to your food.
Since you take milk, no harm will follow. Keep me informed about
the effects on your health.
Cultivate the acquaintance of Amtulbehn. She seems to have a
very pure heart.

DEAR MR. EMERSON,
I have your letter of 16th June enclosing extract from an
account received from the Madras Government regarding picketing. It
does make bad reading if the report is true. But what I am receiving
almost daily from Madras from workers who are thoroughly reliable
eye-witnesses makes me distrust the reports that you are receiving. But
I know that this takes us no further. So far as the Congress is
concerned I want it to implement the Settlement to the fullest extent. I
therefore make an offer. Will you advise local governments to appoint
a Board of Enquiry consisting of a nominee on their behalf and a
nominee on behalf of the Congress to conduct a summary enquiry
into the allegations on either side, and wherever it is found that the
rule of peaceful picketing has been at all violated picketing would be
entirely suspended, the Government undertaking on its part to stop
prosecutions wherever it is found that they have been undertaken in
spite of peaceful picketing. And if my suggestion does not commend
itself to you, you will perhaps suggest something better and more
acceptable. Meanwhile I am enquiring into the specific charge
mentioned in your letter.1

I have your letter and the reply to Lindsay’s letter. I shall

said.
It is good that khadi is being hawked. Here is my message:
“If swaraj means food for the poor, can any aspirant for swaraj,
man or woman, use any cloth other than khadi? Khadi, though costly,
costs less because we have to make do with less of it than the quantity
of other cloth that we would otherwise consume.”
You have mentioned “hawking of khadi and propagation of
swadeshi”. What do you mean by the latter phrase?
It will be fine if the Bose and Sen Gupta affair is settled.
1  In the pictures Gandhiji had been represented as Lord Krishna and the other
leaders as five Pandavas.376       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThat the Working Committee has passed a resolution1 does not
mean that my going has been finally decided. For one thing I have
received no invitation and even if I do receive one, many obstacles lie
in the way. The Provincial Governments have grown very slack in the
implementation of the Delhi Pact. I have no enthusiasm left for going
to England. Read carefully my article in Young India2 and also the
one to be published tomorrow in Navajivan . I have come exactly to
that view now. That way alone lies the well-being of the people, not
otherwise. I have some slight doubt regarding the last two words, but
even that is growing fainter now.

NUDITY AND  SOCIETY
An article on this subject has appeared in Jain Mitra . Its author,
Jain-Nyaya Tirtha Paramesthidas, has asked me to reply to the article;
I wished to express my view in this issue, but in spite of best effort I
could not find the necessary time. I hope to reply to it at the earliest
opportunity.1 As the problem is not of immediate importance, I have
had naturally to give priority to other more urgent matters.
STUDENTS2
A student writes:3
I hear that such undertakings are demanded in other provinces
also. I will not discuss here the question whether this involves a
violation of the Settlement but this raises another question which
requires discussion. Why should parents give such an undertaking;
and if they do, what would be its value? It is likely that the authorities
will act wrongly in many things which lie outside the terms of the
Settlement. When that happens, one’s duty lies not in acquiescing in
such action or co-operating with the authorities but in not co-opera-
ting with them. No one should interpret the Agreement to mean that
the people should now give up resistance to authority and sit back
with folded hands. An agreement may clarify certain things, but may
not clarify some others. The people should certainly not sacrifice their
self-respect in matters not so clarified. Hence I would certainly advise
parents or students not to give such undertakings if they are
demanded from them and if for that reason the latter cannot attend
Government schools, they should stay away from them. All persons
thus concerned should remember that the present uncertain state will
not last long. Before the beginning of the next year at the latest, we
shall have known whether the Congress demand is going to be
accepted. There is no need to say what should be done in case it is
rejected.

Can we carry salt from a village where it may be manufactured and sell it in
surrounding villages where it cannot be?
If the villages are so near that one can reach them on foot one
can certainly sell there the salt manufactured by oneself.
Does the Simla Notification make any difference to the law hitherto in force
that, within 10 miles of the coastline, no one could stock more than one Bengal
maund of salt?
There can be no such law though I had heard of a notification
to that effect having been issued. The latest notification issued should
be understood to cancel all previous notifications that may be
inconsistent with it. The correct position is this: According to the
Agreement one may stock the salt needed for one’s consumption or
manufactured by oneself within the limits of one’s village and
intended for sale in places which one can reach on foot.
Can one stock salt for sale? Fishermen need more salt in the month of
Bhadrapad. Can one stock enough salt for them and sell it to them at that time?
The answer to this is included in the reply above.
Can we make in Government land the pits and beds for manufacturing salt? Or
should we make them in our own?
Such pits can be made wherever salt can be manufactured. As
for private land the owner’s permission would be required, and hence
the Agreement implies that pits may be made in Government land or
one’s own.
IRRELIGION IN THE NAME OF RELIGION
There is a village, named Raghvanaj in Matar Taluka. It is well

Thakkar Bapa a report, the following extract from which deserves to
be pondered over by all Hindus.1
This is the height of tyranny. I do not blame the Dharalas much
for the incident. The blame lies with the so-called highcaste Hindus.
The Dharalas are merely acting under the influence of the atmosphere
which the former have created. In wielding this whip of my pen, I

certainly hope to be able to wake up Congress workers and the readers
of Navajivan . In such a situation, the Congress workers who come to
know of it should themselves take up the spade and start working,
explain the meaning of dharma to Dharalas and others who may be
oppressing the Antyajas and teach the latter to shed fear and to be
self-reliant. All this can be easily done as soon as we get ready to work
with our own hands. But we would do so only if we feel revolted by
such oppression.
MILLIONS SMOKED AWAY
A correspondent from Calcutta writes as follows:1
It is not very likely that my writing on the subject would end the
present waste of millions on smoking. But, apropos of this letter, I
may remark here on a phenomenon which I have been observing. We
seem to have become indifferent in keeping up the reforms which had
spontaneously spread during the satyagraha movement. The inference
to be drawn from this is alarming. If we behave well only while we are
fighting and lapse into slackness as soon as the intoxication of battle is
over, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to preserve swaraj after it
is won. In that case, would it not be desirable that the struggle be
prolonged? Perhaps such a conclusion is not altogether justified, but I
certainly fear that it may be in the interest of the country that the
struggle should continue sufficiently long so that the people may
acquire the capacity to preserve swaraj. The fight ended before we had
acquired strength enough to assimilate the reforms brought about
while it was going on. May I hope that readers who have become
indifferent in this matter will draw the appropriate lesson from this,
shake off their indifference and wake up others as well? To those who
realize that the satyagraha fight is a fight for self-purification, every
day is a day of battle or, if you like, of peace, for the effort for
self-purification should not be relaxed even for a moment.

Everyone must have read the resolution of the Congress
Working Committee. It says in substance that if other conditions are
favourable and if I am invited, I should attend the Round Table
Conference to put before it the Congress demand even if the
communal question remains unsolved. I did not like the resolution. I
opposed it. I even placed before the Committee for discussion a draft
resolution along the lines I desired. But I was defeated and the
resolution to the above effect was passed by a majority.
Though I am often described as an autocrat, I consider myself a
man who accepts the supremacy of the people’s voice; it is in my
nature to give in to a panch. Panch means the voice of the people. I,
therefore, accepted the resolution passed by the majority. There is an
exception to this rule. We cannot give in to anyone on a question of
principle. But there are not many principles in life. one who at every
step refuses, in the name of principle, to listen to others is autocratic
and selfish. Questions of principle arise only rarely. Here there was no
such question, and so I gave in. I had often declared my determina-
tion not to attend the Round Table Conference if the Hindu-Muslim,
i.e., the communal question was not solved. But I could not convince
the Working Committee of the correctness of my position. Ordinarily
it would not be proper for me to put before the public my argument.
No member has a right to publish anything that is discussed in the
Working Committee. But in this case, the Committee has given me
permission to do so. The Committee felt that in order to enable me to
explain my position as also its own policy it was necessary to give me
such permission.
The reasoning behind my reluctance to go to the Round Table
Conference without solving the communal question was as follows:
Even if the question was solved, the acceptance of the Congress
demand in England was unlikely, but if it was not solved the sanction
behind the demands would be lost. ‘You cannot put your own house
in order and cannot unite yourselves, and still you ask for indepen-
dence!’ Even if the members do not say this openly out of politeness,
they would think thus and we would read their thought in their eyes.
And they would, on the whole, be justified in taunting us thus.
1 Vide footnote 2, “My  Notes”VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      381It would be better to accept our weakness rather than invite ridi-
cule by going in such a pitiable condition. A satyagrahi never hides
his weakness. According to the law of satyagraha, from the admission
of weakness new strength is born. The first step in conquering
weakness is its admission.
No one should conclude from my argument that the Working
Committee’s resolution is an attempt to hide our weakness. It reflects
the consequence of weakness and hence amounts to unconscious
hiding of it. The logical consequence of the admission of the weak-
ness would be not to go to the Round Table Conference. That alone
would be true admission of the weakness. One who does not have the
strength to walk and admits that in words but actually tries to walk, has
not truly admitted his weakness and by walking weakens himself all
the more. He may even faint and collapse.
Now if we admit our incapacity to solve the problem and do not
send a representative of the Congress to the Round Table Conference,
what should we do instead? That would not mean that we give up our
fight for purna swaraj. The Round Table Conference is only one
means of securing it. We may have to let go that means. Everyone will
understand this much at once. But we should even give up the desire
and the hope to secure purna swaraj through the Round Table
Conference. We have then to swallow one bitter dose, and that is that
whatever fight we start will not be for purna swaraj in name, though
the result would be the same.
If the communal question cannot be solved satisfactorily now,
then it means that the methods which we have tried so far to solve it
were wrong or inadequate. The attempts so far made aimed at brin-
ging about understanding among the Hindu and Muslim politicians.
They were of the nature of a fight for power among them. From such
fighting no unity can come, none has come at least. If, therefore, the
Congress desires unity of the heart, it should get out of that field and
try to gain power over the hearts of Muslims and the other commu-
nities as it has gained over those of the Hindus. Such an attempt is
bound to result in a unity of hearts. There is no scope for failure in it.
The power of the Congress has its source in service of the people. If
the Congress programme is so organized that the Muslims and the
others continue to get equal benefit, then they also will come to know
the Congress.382       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIIt is not that today nothing is done for their service. Nevertheless
we must acknowledge the fact that Muslims, Sikhs and others do not
respond to the Congress as much as the Hindus do. Instead of finding
fault with these communities for this state of affairs, it would be better
and more graceful for the Congress to admit its deficiency.
When the Congress will be overflowing with Indians other than
Hindus, then there will be no difference between a communal solution
and a national solution, the Muslims or other communities will not be
afraid, because they are fewer in number, of the far more numerous
Hindus, and the Hindus, physically weaker though in a majority, will
not be afraid of the physically stronger Mussalmans or Sikhs. Each
community’s strength will benefit the other communities. Unless such
conditions are created, paper swaraj will fly off with a puff like the
sheet of paper on which it is written.
What is paper swaraj, and what is the other swaraj? Let us see.
The swaraj got through the Round Table Conference means the swaraj
constitution accepted by us and passed by British Parliament into law.
This is the swaraj on the statute book, i.e., paper swaraj. Behind it,
there would not be the signatures of the millions; in fact the millions
would not be trusting one another. If Hindus and Muslims in Kanpur
and Kashi are fighting one another, then such swaraj would be no
better than chaff.
True swaraj is that which will have signatures of the millions
behind it, whose cool shelter the millions would enjoy, and in which
the incidents at Kanpur and Kashi would be past history to us and we
would laugh heartily at our past follies. Whether or not such swaraj
has become statutory, it would be true swaraj and would be like wheat,
for it would be nourishing.
I am of the view that if we cannot solve the communal question
satisfactorily and if we decide to fight for the swaraj of my concep-
tion, then our boycott of the Round Table Conference will be a sign
of our strength and will uphold our self-respect.
This is the fight of my conception. Even if the communal
question is not solved and the representative of the Congress does not
attend the Round Table Conference, something is bound to be done.
Let the communal-minded Hindus and Muslims and others share a
little power with the British under that Constitution and think that they
are participating in ruling the country. The Congress instead of asking
for power from that Government will demand the things for whichVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      383they want power and, if they are refused, it will fight through satya-
graha. We do not want political power for its own sake, we want it for a
certain end. That end is service of the millions. If we cannot get today
the reins of power in our hands to improve their economic, moral and
social conditions, we need not on that account stop that work.
By giving such a turn to the fight for swaraj, we can bypass the
communal tangle and invite all the people to join the fight. Nobody
will be able to keep out of it. Those who refuse to join will lose their
face. All those who have the spirit of self-sacrifice and courage cannot
but join in the demand for what is necessary for the uplift of the
millions.
For example, a fight for revision of the land revenue laws to
make them more equitable and to reduce the burden of land revenue
would be for the benefit of all communities and in time everybody
would join it. Such a fight would result either in the desired reforms
being effected or in those holding power handing over the power to
the rebellious people. Either result would mean the same to us. As a
result of such a fight communal discords would disappear and the
people would know who their servants were and who their masters.
The people’s strength would increase day by day, they would get true
political education and know where their interests lay. This, according
to me, would be true swaraj. If we adopt such a course in time we
would find purna swaraj in our lap.
But I could not convince the Working Committee of the sound-
ness of this scheme. The majority of the members felt that as the
Settlement had been signed, if other circumstances were favourable I
must attend the Round Table Conference despite the absence of a
solution of the communal question. I will go out of respect for the
collective decision of the Committee. And if I go, I will use all my
ability to present the Congress demand and to get it accepted. But if
the communal question is not solved, I believe it highly improbable
that our demand will be accepted, and if it is not accepted and if it is
decided to resume the fight, I would try to give the fight the turn I
have explained above.

effort as you can on your side and wherever safety is threatened you
should migrate to safer places. And in order that some action can be

BORSAD,
June 21, 1931
BHAI KASHINATH,
I got your letter.
I certainly intend to write something about the Digambar Jain
Sadhus.1 I am thinking what I can write.
I had a talk with Haribhau, too, about your decision to leave. I
understand your reasons. You two cannot save yourselves from
falling. The fact is that you have already fallen.
He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell
on sense-objects,—such a one, wholly deluded, is called a hypocrite.2
Here we should understand vimudhatma to mean merely that the
person lacks true knowledge and that, therefore, his outward
self-control is of no value. The man who lets his mind dwell on lustful
thoughts cannot be regarded a brahmachari simply because he
refrains from physical gratification. In other words, one must banish
from one’s mind all evil thoughts which may arise in it. Anyone who
wants to succeed in this effort would take the necessary steps, which
you never did. Now you should recognize the lack of self-control in
you both, live humbly as an ordinary married couple and practise
only such self-control outwardly as you can do mentally as well.
Think over the meaning of the bhajan: “Unless the mind is free from
desire, renunciation cannot endure.” Do not feel that I am
reproaching you. Rest assured that I have only tried to open your eyes
to the truth so that you may wake up.
I am enclosing a note3 saying that the sums which you owe to
Navajivan and the Ashram
 should be written off. You may use it. I think that this was a

Instead of borrowing money and then seeking exemption from
repaying the loan, at the very time of drawing the money you should
have asked for so much more by way of honorarium. We ought not to
value in terms of money the work done for a public cause. I write this
for the sake of purity in our dealings. Only if we maintain the highest
standards of purity in our practical affairs can we come out of our
abject condition of mind. He who never feels inwardly poor is richer
than even the richest millionaire.
I am going to Bombay from here on Wednesday. Both of you
may come before that if you wish to. You may, however, save your
time and money, if you can be satisfied with my blessings conveyed to
you through a letter from here. We haven’t yet learnt the lesson of
simplicity. This charge applies to nearly everyone. The fault lies with
the circumstances. I have always had plenty of money at my disposal,
so that I have not succeeded in exercising strict control in its use. I
have therefore often wished how good it would be if people stopped
giving us money and we did not even know how we would get our
next meal. Read again my article1 in Navajivan  on this subject.

charge Rs. 1,000 for a day? Some of them give free service to us. This

not charge for a visit separately, but charges for visits and medicines

It will be difficult to find an inmate of the Ashram as sincere as
Panditji. Win him over. Why should he have reason to complain
against you ? You are by nature harsh, curt, reserved. This much is

married at an early age. He observes complete brahmacharya and tells
me that his wife, too, understands the importance of the vow. Mahadev
works in an Ashram which is being run in a place called Hosari. He
and his wife will ultimately settle in that Ashram. Just now, they wish
to learn Hindi. They will learn other things, too, but they are
especially eager to master Hindi. See what arrangements you can
make for them. Personally, I think you can enlist the services of that
crazy fellow Parasram. Though crazy, he has clung to us. I don’t feel
like shifting him from Kanpur, but we may do that if necessary. It is
certainly desirable that the Ashram should have perfect arrangements
for teaching Hindi.

Mahavir’s fever must have left him.
Mirabehn and Gaur Gopaldas intend to go to the Ashram.
Mirabehn now realizes that her place is in the Ashram or wherever
there is some work to do. She is convinced of this and wishes to live
accordingly. That is why she is going there. Assign her any work you
think proper. Make whatever arrangements you do on the
understanding that, if I have to go to England, she will accompany
me. If I have to go, it will be in the middle of August.
I am intentionally sending Gaur Gopal there. He is a youth of a
very straightforward nature. You must have come to know that he
belongs to a zamindar family. Make him as comfortable as you can
and assign to him any work you think proper. See that he acquires
proficiency in Hindi and learns to card and spin well. I should like
him to complete the whole course in weaving. Arrange his work in
such a way that he gets some time for reading.

Mirabehn will leave by the Kathiawar Mail tomorrow. It arrives
there at 7.30 or 8 a.m. She will hire a tonga from the station to take
her to the Ashram. If Ranchhodbhai or somebody else agrees to go to
the station and take her in a car to the Ashram, that will save her time.
Get Mirabehn’s room vacated for her. Balvant and Gaur Gopal will
probably be travelling with her.

the ambition to jump high. At present you have quite a large number
of grown-up women and girls under your charge. If this field of the
Ashram activities is perfectly organized, the Ashram will overflow with
women and girls. Think that your family is of unlimited size.

531. ADVICE TO FARMERS, BORSAD
BORSAD,
June 22, 1931
Answering various questions put to him, Mahatma Gandhi said that everyone
who could afford should pay all dues, including past dues and taqavi. By affording, he
meant ability to pay without borrowing and without selling their belongings. He had,
from the moment he entered Borsad, made it clear to the authorities and in his
personal conversation with the Collector, that it was on that basis that he proposed
to work and offer help and it was on that basis that the lists were prepared and
payments made.
He was happy to see that all but Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000 had been paid and he
had been given an assurance that this sum also would be paid up in two or three days.
There was now, therefore, no question of further calls upon them during the present
year. He had, however, written to the Collector, asking him to furnish the names ofVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      395those whom he might suspect of having withheld their correct position from him. He
would be severely disappointed if he had been misled by any of the landholders.
He warned them and told them that if there were any whom they knew, they
should bring their names to his notice and induce them to pay land revenue.
Regarding village officers who were still awaiting reinstatement, he said that he was
in correspondence with the authorities and hoped to have a satisfactory decision
about them.
Concluding, Mahatma Gandhi exhorted Patidars1, who had taken prominent
part in the struggle, to get rid of untouchability and treat other backward commu-
nities, such as Dharalas and Barias, as themselves.
Asked what they should do regarding their confiscated lands sold to third
parties, Mahatma Gandhi said that he hoped still to secure all such lands, but if the
so-called purchasers came to take possession no opposition should be offered them.
If they were still in possession, they could till the land but they should realize that
they ran the risk of having to lose labour and seed if they were called upon to give up
possession, which they would have to do. Whilst no one should work on such land on
behalf of purchasers, no molestation should be offered against those who wished to
work.

June 23, 1931
CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
I got your joint letter (only three lines from Sushila).
Corruption you will find everywhere. The reformer and public worker
should do what he can to remove it, himself remain untouched by it,
and cease worrying. However, personally I do believe that persons like
you would get better support in India and so be able to do some work.
But now that you have gone back there, you should stay on for some
time and, if you wish to wind up the work, do so properly before you
come away. It would certainly be good if Indian Opinion continues.
But rather than that it should pass into the hands of persons who may
not run it well, it had better stop. Everything that exists is bound to
perish sooner or later. Let Indian Opinion , then, meet its end at your
hands. Meet Kallenbach, Omar Sheth and others, and do what you
think proper after discussing the matter with them.
You should plan to return here when the struggle is resumed. It
seems certain that it will be resumed next year, though I will make
every effort to see that it does not become necessary. Don’t decide
anything in haste or excitement.
It is a painful thing that Sorabji should refuse to pay even the
policy premiums. The Ashram cannot pay them. Do not mind if theVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      397premiums already paid are lost. Now that Jalbhai also is there, see if
you can persuade the two brothers and make them pay the premiums.
Is any surrender value of the policy payable, or nothing at all? What is
Sorabji’s financial condition?
Nothing is yet certain about my going to England. Ramdas and

If influential workers in Limbasi1 take the lead and permit
Antyajas, opposition from the few would subside of itself. But they
must be real workers, and not merely workers in name. Why not call
the people of the village together and tell them that you would
disband the Ashram? If the people don’t let you, there is no need to
hurry; if they agree, then too there is no hurry. But it would be good
if they say yes. Our work would get publicity.

a person who is disinclined for some reason to return to the Ashram
finds himself without work at a given place, he may certainly look for
it elsewhere.
I read your letter to Mahadev about the headman. What can we
do in the case? It should be proved that he cannot pay. I cannot do

DEAR SIR,
I write this letter regarding the case of Syt. Gopal Anant Ogale1
who was sentenced on the 2nd of April 1931 to one year’s rigorous
imprisonment under Sec. 124 I.P.C. I have gone through the article
and the  translation  put in as Exhibit in the case  and  I  venture
to submit  that  in  terms  of  Cl. 13   Sub-section 1  of  the  Settlement
Syt. Ogale is entitled to discharge because in that article there is
no incitement to violence. That there may be sedition in the article, it
will be admitted, is irrelevant so far as the Settlement is concerned. For
the sake of protection I understand that the case is under appeal but I
suggest that the clause referred to of the Settlement is unequivocal. As
there is no incitement to violence and as he was arrested during the
civil disobedience movement he is entitled to discharge.2 Indeed, it
seems to me that as soon as the Settlement was published, the
prosecution should have been withdrawn under Cl. 12 Sub-section 1

seizure of licensed arms taken in the course of searches and in regard to which no

DEAR MR. EMERSON,
Your personal letter will be destroyed as soon as I have finished
this.
I believe in the English saying, “Take care of your pennies and
the pounds will take care of themselves”. If we act on the square over
the comparatively little settlement1, the big issue in London will take
care of itself. I do therefore want (p. 69) you please to straighten out
things on your side. There is a tendency in the Provinces to crush the
Congress and the Congress spirit. It is like distrusting or belittling
one’s partner.
On my side, I do not want you to spare me. Your indictments I
shall appreciate. I do not want to hide or overlook a single breach on
our part. I want us to make (p. 70) full reparation for every wrong act
we may do. For I desire with all my heart a permanent settlement, an
honourable partnership. This is impossible if we conceal our
weaknesses or condone breaches on the part of workers. If you only
saw the letters I daily write, the discussions I daily hold on the
necessity of a faithful (p. 71) performance of what you have called
gentlemen’s agreement.
Khansaheb’s speeches have not all been correctly reported. I
wish it had been possible for you to have met him.
I shall write to you about Pandit Jawaharlal later.
You must not get ill.
The newspaper (72) cutting with your comment came as a tonic
relieving the depression of exhausting correspondence dealing with all
kinds of complaints.
Hope you are feeling better.

DEAR MR. BHADRAPUR,
In your letter the other day you said that the non-Dharala
population of Ras was fully entitled to protection at the hands of the
Government and that you were enquiring into the complaints made by
me to you. You will agree with me that no assurance on paper can
possibly bring relief to those who are actually being injured. The only
relief they can see and feel is when the injury ceases. Unfortunately
the same injury that I complained of seems to be continuing. This
time in order to verify so far as it was possible the complaints made by
the residents of Ras I sent Syt. Mahadev Desai to make a local
investigation. The enclosed is his report. You will see therefrom that
the hedges of the poor cultivators are still being destroyed. Valuable
babul trees are being cut down and wood taken away. I understand
from Mr. Perry that, for fear lest the Dharalas might be molested by
the Patidars, additional police still continued to be posted. I wonder if
the police is able to afford any protection to the Patidars and others.
But whether the function of this additional police is or is not to protect
the non-Dharala population of Ras, will you please let me know
whether the Government intend to protect the Patidars of Ras from
continuous molestation or whether they are to look after themselves in
the best manner they can. I shall be away from Borsad for two days,
possibly three. May I ask for immediate attention to the complaints
and may I know when I may expect reply to my letter about the
Mukhi?

AS AT SABARMATI ,
June 24, 1931
MY DEAR CHARLIE,
I have your letter. I shall look forward to Mrs. Polak’s book1. I
know it will revive old and pleasant memories and it will tell me of
things I have perhaps altogether forgotten.
It is a good thing that your two books2 are reaching the proper
people.
As is your wont you are distressed over what your eyes see and
ears hear. This time it is the terrible unemployment in Lancashire and
what you see and hear acts as an effective barrier against perceiving
the truth. I have seen from extensive experience the truth of a legal
maxim which says: “Hard cases make bad law.” Many legal maxims
are also sound moral maxims as this one is. I can say with perfect
detachment although I am immersed in the Indian turmoil that the
way you suggest is not the way to help Lancashire. If it was wrong any
time for Lancashire to impose its cloth upon India by hook or by
crook it is wrong also today and more so because India has become
conscious of the wrong. And if India now refuses to be party to the
wrong, surely she won’t be adding wrong to wrong but she would be
assisting the process of undoing the wrong done by Lancashire. That
the labourers were not conscious of the wrong that was being done is
no justification for the wrong itself being sustained by the party
wronged, that is, India or anybody else. The proper course is to show
the labourers how they have been unconsciously assisting the wrong
done by Lancashire to India and therefore how necessary it is to
retrace the step. The first thing to do therefore is, if Lancashire cloth
cannot be sold outside India, to find some other employment. What
that can be it is difficult for me to say. I do not know how England
itself is clothed. Why should not the same machinery be used for
preparing the clothing of the kind required by England or better still,
why should not the machinery be scrapped and the unemployed take

them but I have given them to show which way my mind is working.
Let me help you by putting before you another fact. Foreign
cloth boycott has created a kind of atmosphere. Its effect upon
Lancashire is nothing so serious as it is made out. In the first place do
you know that before the boycott became a live thing Lancashire sent
to India only 12% of her output of piecegoods? Have you studied the
illuminating figures1 published in a recent issue of Young India
showing conclusively that Lancashire had to fear not so much Indian
boycott as the ever-growing Japanese competition? My heart goes out
to the unemployed. It goes out to you in your terrific moral struggle.
But I cannot be helpful in the way you suggest. Of that I am quite
clear. That there is a way out I have no doubt and probably if I came
to London, after a study of the situation on the spot I should be able
to suggest some practical solution. And if I came at all I would
certainly do as you want me to, first of all proceed to Lancashire and
see the unemployed face to face.
But I am not at all sure that I shall be able to go. As yet of
course there is no invitation. The Settlement is causing me much
anxiety. The local governments are not playing the game. Lathi
charges too are now and then resorted to. Jawaharlal sends me bitter
complaints from Allahabad. But I shall see what is possible when the
time for sailing comes. Jawaharlal cannot accompany me unless he
forms part of the deputation. 1 do not think it would be advisable
though of course if he was in London his presence would relieve me
of a great deal of responsibility. Malaviyaji and Ansari are a certainty.
They are most likely to be invited apart from the Working Committee
and so is Mrs. Naidu. I note you will house me with Muriel.
Love.

awakening, and whether they took any direct part in the movement or
not there is no doubt that they were all filled with the spirit of the

I have your letter.2 The persecuted men can certainly go to
court. In any case they must not submit to any tyranny and be content
to remain outside the caste. After all we want to break down false and
injurious caste barriers.

DEAR FRIEND,
I thank you for your lucidly written letter of June 5th.1 I agree
in the main with all you say. The rumour about my wearing European
costume if I went to London is as ill-founded as my rumoured visit to
America. All the same I appreciate the motive lying behind your

BORSAD,
June 24, 1931
BHAISHRI FULCHAND,
I have your letter. Your explanation does not absolve you from
blame. My point is that it is wrong to criticize one State in the territory
of another. Such criticism involves violence. You should think over all
that I have said to you from the point of view of non-violence. If you
think that the principle of non-violence itself is an error, my argument
loses all force.
Blessings from

We have the untouchables, the shame and curse of the Hindu
society. But we have also other communities whom we—the so-called
higher classes—treat almost as slaves and keep in quarters designed
for our cattle. Representatives of one such community have addressed
a letter which I condense as follows:1
We are representatives of the Rajwar community living in
the districts of Gaya, Patna, Monghyr and Palamau, in the
Province of Bihar and Orissa. . . .
On refusal to give begar2 the zamindar forthwith begins a
suit for arrears of rent, gets decree, puts the jot3 to auction and
evicts the tenant from the land in his possession.
A Rajwar child, no sooner he reaches his 6th or 7th year,
becomes almost the property of his parents’ landlord; he is
made to tend the landlord’s cattle and do all sorts of odd jobs. .
. . In fact he leads the life of a slave, a mere chattel of the
landlord.
For working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Rajwars are paid at the
rate of 3 seers of unhusked rice per diem and no wages in cash
are ever paid to them. . . .
The Rajwar children are not allowed to be sent to the
primary schools and the teachers too are not allowed to teach
the boys by the landlord.
Whenever there is any theft or larceny or dacoity or any
crime whatever in the locality where this community is living,
the first suspicion and the first brunt of the police enquiry must
be borne by it, although there may not be the slightest evidence
for the same. . . .
We have already submitted these memorials to the District
Magistrates of Gaya and Patna, and to the Chief Secretary, Bihar
and Orissa Government but we have not as yet learnt what steps
the respective authorities have taken. We hope that you will do
something to ameliorate our condition.
The letter is written for the representatives and probably

by about twenty-five representatives. What however matters is not who
wrote it but the statements made therein, if they are true.
They are highly likely to be true in the main. For such treatment
is not an isolated phenomenon of Bihar. Almost all the provinces have
these backward, suppressed, slave communities. They are no heritage
from the British. We have had them for ages and all the greater shame
on us for that.
We may plead a thousand excuses for their existence in the days
gone by. But in these days of enlightenment, awakening and insis-
tence on swaraj, we have no excuse for tolerating the atrocity. Con-
gress workers have to take up the cause of these communities wher-
ever they are found. They should try to enlist the sympathy and co-
operation of those who ‘own’ these men and women. Swaraj is the
sum total of all the activities that go to build up a free and vigorous
nation concious of the strength that comes from right doing. The
existence of slave communities is aterrible wrong and must therefore
be a hindrance in our march towards the goal.

554. A GENTLE REBUKE
C. Rajagopalachari’s eagle eye sees everything that appears in
print about the drink evil. He saw a report of my very innocent speech
at the village of Maroli1 where the other day I laid the foundation of a
weaving institute. I had there attempted to show the connection that
exists between factory labour and drink and said how mithubehn Petit
had, whilst doing prohibition work, discovered that if the people who
ceased to visit the liquor shops she picketed were to be permanently
weaned from drink, they should have some ambition provided in life,
some work found for them during their idle hours. I then showed how
she found such occupation in hand-spinning and weaving. I further
went on to show that if people had to do excessive labour, they would
want some stimulant and illustrated it by an experience from my own
life when during the Boer War I had to issue from the commissariat
rations of rum for those bearers who were used to drink and who
pleaded with me for rum which, they said, would enable them to bear
the fatigue and resume next day’s march. Of course, this was a
1  Vide, “Speech at Maroli”, 12-6-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      413superstition. But superstitions die hard.
Rajagopalachari feared that the report that he had read would be
distorted to yield all kinds of meanings favourable to the opponents
of prohibition. His fear has been justified. I have received embarr-
assing congratulations on my conversion to sanity. They embarrass
me because I am not conscious of the conversion imputed to me. I
feel like a man who falsely reported to have died reads his obituary
notices and blushes to have the virtues he never knew he had
possessed.
Let me therefore re-declare my faith in undiluted prohibition
before I land myself in deeper water. If I was appointed dictator for
one hour for all India, the first thing I would do would be to close
without compensation all the liquor shops, destroy all the toddy palms
such as I know them in Gujarat, compel factory owners to produce
humane conditions for their workmen and open refreshment and
recreation rooms where these workmen would get innocent drinks and
equally innocent amusements. I would close down the factories if the
owners pleaded want of funds. Being a teetotaller, I would retain my
sobriety in spite of the possession of one hour’s dictatorship and
therefore arrange for the examination of my European friends and
diseased persons who may be in medical need of brandy and the like
at State expense by medical experts and where necessary they would
receive certificate which would entitle them to obtain the prescribed
quantity of the fiery waters from certified chemists. The rule will
apply mutatis mutandis  to intoxicating drugs.
For the loss of revenue from drinks, I would straightway cut
down the military expenditure and expect the Commander-in-Chief to
accommodate himself to the new condition in the best way he can.
The workmen left idle by the closing of factories, I would remove to
model farms to be immediately opened as far as possible in the
neighbourhood of the factories unless I was advised during that brief
hour that the State could profitably run the factories under the
required conditions and could therefore take over from the owners.
Young India, 25-6-1931414       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI555. TERRIBLE IF TRUE
I take the following from a complaint about picketing:
In rural areas there is definite evidence that everything short of physical
violence has been resorted to by volunteers. Would-be customers are
obstructed, abused and generally harassed, and toddy shop renters have been
put to considerable loss and in some instances have been so discouraged that
they have ceased to get trees marked for tapping and closed their shops rather
than suffer further indignities. The Congress office in Tellichery issued
summonses to the principal renters to appear before them and few had the
courage to disobey. Those who appeared were summarily told to close their
shops, and when they asked for compensation they were told that Congress
would do nothing for them.
 If these complaints are true this picketing should be suspended
immediately. Though as soon as I had this complaint I wrote
inquiring about the allegations, I thought it was better for the sake of
workers in general to publish the complaint. It may be mentioned that
somewhat similar complaints have been received regarding cloth-
picketing too. I can but repeat the warning1 I have issued in these
pages that it would be better for the Congress, better for the cause of
prohibition, whether of intoxicating drinks and drugs or foreign cloth,
that we ceased picketing altogether than that there was the slightest
departure from the terms of the Delhi Settlement. If picketing cannot
remain peaceful, it should be abandoned altogether.
It is being discovered that the more effective method is to pay
house-to-house visit and meet the drunkards, opium-eaters or
foreign-cloth users in their own homes and explain to them the evil of
the use of any of the three things. There may be also addresses at
street corners and distribution of leaflets. Prabhat pheries2 too can do
this propaganda through swadeshi and anti-drink and drug songs.
Foreign-cloth boycott may also be assisted by door to door hawking
of khadi, registering orders and organizing the weaving of self-spun
yarn. Such levelling up [of] the atmosphere cannot but affect the use
of drinks and drugs and foreign cloth.

But how if these charges are in the main or wholly untrue. I
know that in Gujarat there is a tendency growing up to molest
peaceful picketers and, what is more mischievious still, there is going
on an unrestrained sale of liquor at odd hours and in odd places
under cover of the law. Sjt. C. Rajagopalachari who is the General
Secretary of the Temperance League in the place vacated by Mr.
Anderson and who is a politician only because he is a social reformer
is convinced that in the South a deliberate policy of repression of
strictly peaceful picketing has been launched in the shape of faked
prosecutions and physical interference. From Ludhiana, Ambala,
Muttra and elsewhere come authentic reports of lathi charges and the
like. I have deliberately refrained from publishing these statements of
which the various organizations have furnished me with a full record.
Besides this, there are complaints pouring in about other matters. I can
only give the assurance to the public that not one of these has escaped
my attention. But I cannot carry on a public propaganda at the same
time that I am carrying on delicate negotiations with the Central
Government from and through which I expect to gain relief in most
of, if not all of these cases.
Meanwhile I must ask all Congress workers to be patient. They
must not allow themselves to be provoked into civil disobedience. It is
never the first, it is always the last resort. We must exhaust all the
intermediate processes before we can take up that last sovereign
remedy. Whilst the Settlement lasts, we have the law-courts too, open
to us. I know that at best they bring us poor comfort. But, such as they
are, they may not be passed by, even as we may not pass by, the
respective departments of the executive Government for seeking
relief. Happily nowadays we have all over India lawyers who give their
services to the Congress organizations free of charge. Wherever
therefore these facilities exist, Congress organizations should avail
themselves of them and try to obtain such relief as is locally possible.
They must not embark on civil disobedience without first obtaining
the permission of the Working Committee. It is to meet very shortly1
and I promise to place it in full possession of all the complaints and
take directions from it. Our safety and honour today demand a
meticulous performance by us of all the conditions of the Settlement.
1  It met in Bombay from July 7 to 12.416       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIBut I would appeal to the provincial governments and the
members of the Civil Service to come to the rescue. I must not conceal
from them and the public the suspicion based on the evidences before
me that they are in many cases hindering the working of the
Settlement where they are not wilfully breaking it. Let it not be proved
what is being said of them that some of them want the Settlement to
break to pieces. Let it not be said of them that they destroyed the
edifice that Lord Irwin gave anxious days and anxious nights to build
up. Let them realize that the Settlement is a solemn contract not
between two individuals but between two organizations, hitherto
fighting, now seeking to cooperate. They may not distrust the
Congress workers and treat them as if they were enemies even as the
Congressmen may not, whilst the contract persists, distrust every
official act.

556. A MARTYR
Whilst the Working Committee was deliberating in Bombay
during the early part of the month, there was a public meeting in
Dongri at which there was an uproar and at which a youth was fatally
stabbed. The news of the death was brought to the Working
Committee. It created a sensation but at the time it was thought that
some unknown unidentifiable person had died. On returning to Bor-
sad I had a letter from Sjt. Kishorelal Mashruwala who deploring the
tragedy gave me some details about the deceased. I thereupon asked
him to procure fuller details which I now have.
Brave and good Pannalal was only 22 years old when he
received the fatal stab on that fateful night from one of the excited
Mussalman crowd. Accompanied by his father and younger brother,
Pannalal had gone to the Dongri meeting specially to hear Khan
Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan who was among others advertised to speak
at the meeting. After they had heard the Khan Saheb the father hailed
a victoria and they got in. Being khaddar-clad they were taken for
nationalist leaders. A howling crowd surrounded them. Stones were
rained on them. All of them were hurt. Pannalal’s left eyebrow was
bleeding. Nothing minding, in order to lighten his father’s sorrow, he
made light of his wound. Suddenly there came into his left ribs a deep
stab. Blood gushed from the wounded side. Out came the entrails.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      417Pannalal bore it all bravely and asked to be taken to the hospital where
he said his wound would be dressed and all would be well. Alas ! all
was not well. In spite of all the attention given to him the brave young
man died the next day.
He was born of wealthy parents. His father Maganlal Zaveri is a
flourishing jeweller, much trusted and respected for his honesty. His
uncle is the Chief Judge of the Jodhpur High Court. The deceased
leaves a young widow to whom he was married only eighteen months
ago. The parents, having come under the influence of the national
movement, simplified the life of the family and sent Pannalal to the
national school. After having studied up to the sixth standard he left
studies to help his father in business. But Pannalal never left national
work. He was one of the party that raided the Wadala Salt Works and
came in for lathi blows. He always joined the dangerous processions
which were the feature of those days. Pannalal has lived by dying. My
congratulations to the parents for having had such a worthy son. Let
death and especially a death such as this leave no sting behind. The
body has been reduced to ashes but out of the ashes will rise true
unity among us. If we do not resent this death and would give many
more lives if need be, I know that true unity will not be long in
coming.
As for the widow let me hope that their love for their son will
prompt the parents to give her the education the girl widow may
desire or be fitted for and that they will give her every encouragement
to remarry when she grows to maturity. Let them, if they have drunk
in the spirit of the age, shed the superstition that a widow is the
property of the husband’s family to remain as their slave. A widow
must have the same right as a widower and must be taught to know
that she has the same free choice as men.
And of the Mussalmans who approve of such murders ? Surely,
the cause of Islam or the cause of peace which the word ‘Islam’
means, has not been advanced by the murder. It cannot be right to
take innocent life; Pannalal had given no provocation. How I wish
Pannalal’s murder would open the eyes of those whose heart approves
such murders and who make them possible. Is it not possible to
arrange a joint meeting on the very spot where the murder took place
and to declare that whether we could evolve a common formulae
regarding the political issue or not, such murders would be made
impossible. Such a meeting is not impossible as, so far as I am aware,418       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIPannalal’s people have forgiven the wrong and the Congress Com-
mittee purposely avoided a public funeral in order that passion might
not be in flamed. We ought to be able to hold public meetings
anywhere and fearlessly express views even though they may be
unpalatable in [a] particular neighbourhood.

THE EDITOR, “YOUNG INDIA”
SIR,
In the village Pipri, Tehsil Purwa, District Unao, a raid is said to have been
made on the tenants by the zamindars of the village along with the Sub-Divisional
Magistrate, Pt. Chandra Mohan Nath and an armed guard on 30th May, 1931. . . .
It may however be said to the credit of the tenants, however illiterate they may
be, . . . they are perfectly non-violent, and not a single example can be cited in which
the tenants might have resorted to the methods of violence even for self-defence.

I publish this very serious letter1 with only inconsequential
alterations. It is undoubtedly libellous, if the allegations are not true. I
shall gladly publish any explanations that the zamindars or the
Sub-Divisional Magistrate may wish to give. The matter demands
immediate inquiry, if the allegations are substantially correct, the
Zamindars’ Association should take up the matter and deal with the
zamindars. I may add that I wired to the writer if he could support the
allegations and he promptly wired back in the affirmative.

SELF-RESPECT ABOVE ALL
I have letters1 from several provinces saying that the education
authorities are imposing conditions on the return of students who had
left their schools or colleges during the struggle. A circular of which a
copy has been sent by one of the correspondents requires parents to
give guarantees that their children will not take part in politics. These
correspondents ask me whether these conditions are consistent with
the Settlement.
Without entering into that question for the time being, I have no
hesitation in saying that neither students nor parents if they have any
self-respect left in them should accept such conditions. What will it
profit the students or the parents if they have to lose their souls to gain
the questionable advantage of a public education and a certificate?
There are the national institutions open to the students. If they do not
like these, they can study at home. It is a gross superstition to suppose
that knowledge can be obtained only by going to schools and
colleges. The world produced brilliant students before schools and
colleges came into being. There is nothing so ennobling or lasting as
self-study. Schools and colleges make most of us mere receptacles for
holding the superfluities of knowledge. Wheat is left out and mere
husk is taken in. I do not wish to decry schools and colleges as such.
They have their use. But we are making altogether too much of them.
They are but one of the many means of gaining knowledge.
OH, THOSE ADDRESSES
Manibehn, Sardar Vallabhbhai’s daughter who does secretarial
work, wardrobe keeping and nursing for her father and therefore
always travels with him plaintively asks:
Why do the people give Father so many addresses, when he wants
money? You know better than I do that he has nowhere to lay his head on. He
has no house or chests to keep the many addresses he receives. He has no safes
in which he can keep costly caskets and gifts. For me it becomes positively a
burden to take charge of these addresses and gifts. I would like people not to
give addresses and gifts to any Congressmen. Their service must be its own
1  Vide “My Notes”, sub-title, “Students”.420       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIreward. But in any case, will you not ask them to spare Father. Let them refrain
from giving him the addresses he does not need, let them give him the money
he needs for the very work they expect him to do and so much admire.
I need add nothing to these sentiments beyond heartily
endorsing them and commending them to those who would invite the
Sardar to their places.
DUTY OF DISCIPLINARIANS
An Akola correspondent asks:1
If even elected officials in a Congress organization do not carry out the
rule of khadi laid down in the constitution, what is one to do who believes in
strict adherence to the rules?
The question is more easily asked than answered. The decision
would depend upon so many surrounding circumstances. Therefore it
is possible only to give a general guidance which it may be necessary
to depart from as new and varying circumstances arise.
Assuming that the member believing in khaddar out and out
finds that the majority do not observe the rule, that he has drawn their
attention to the breach, that he has drawn the attention of the chief
officials also and fails to find any satisfaction, he should by way of
protest retire from the elected body to which he belongs. He will
simply remain a four-anna member without exercising his right of
voting. But outside the organization he will preach discipline without
being bitter towards those who are lax in observing it. He will also do
such Congress work as commends itself to him if he can do so without
incurring the displeasure of the powers that be in the Congress organi-
zation. A vast amount of constructive work can be done without one
being a member.
WHY DON’T THEY SPIN
A correspondent bitingly writes:
When you address meetings you ask people to spin for the sake of your
Daridranarayana2. If anyone asks for your autograph, Bania-like, you
impose the condition that he or she should spin! Then what prevents you from
asking Congress members on so many committees to spin? Why do they not
all spin by way of encouragement to others ? Or is spinning to be reserved for

ones of committees?
I apologize to the writer. Only let him remember that whereas I
cannot always give spinning demonstrations before big audiences, I
give actual demonstrations before members of committees. And is not
an ounce of practice more than tons of preaching? But the writer is
perhaps right in his sarcasm. There are hundreds of Congress
committees if not thousands. I do not speak to all of them through my
spinning. It would certainly be a good example and would add
imperceptibly but materially to the wealth of the country if the
thousands of members of these committees would spin regularly for at
least half an hour. If these figures were tabulated and published from
week to week, it will fill the atmosphere with the spirit of industry,
sacrifice and khadi, the emblem of Daridranarayana . Boycott of
foreign cloth through khadi will then be accomplished much earlier
than the most sanguine among us dare expect. But will they? “They
spin not, neither do they toil.”1

559. LETTER TO K. B. BHADRAPUR
AS AT BORSAD,
June 25, 1931
DEAR MR. BHADRAPUR,
I have your astonishing letter of 23rd inst. I had written to you
that the complainants had no evidence whereby they could fix the
blame on the Dharalas. Nor had I asked for any prosecutions. What I
had asked for was a preventive measure and if you tell me that where
complainants cannot trace the guilty parties the Government will leave
them to their fate I shall take the answer. But I was unprepared for the
gratuitous statement that it is not beyond suspicion that the damages
might have been selfinflicted to fasten the crime on the Dharalas. You
will permit me to say that sentiments like this amount to putting a
premium on crime. Does it not strike you as unthinkable that the
Patidars should engage in self-destruction for the doubtful purpose of
proving the Dharalas guilty? Nor am I able to see what earthly
purpose they can serve by cutting all their hedges in order to fasten
1  St. Matthew , VI. 28.422       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIany crime on the Dharalas. If you have at the back of your mind the
Dharala Mukhi of Ras I must tell you that it was not the Patidars who
made the suggestion that the presence of a Dharala Mukhi was
probably responsible for the cutting of these hedges. In any case the
case against the Dharala Mukhi stands on an independent footing. It is
as I hold part of the Settlement whereas it would be open to you to say
that the granting of protection to the Patidars is no part of the
Settlement and I would not be able to challenge a position of that
description.

BOMBAY,
June 25, 1931
To a question put about his participation in the Federal Structure Committee
[Gandhiji replied:]
If I attend the Round Table Conference, I shall possibly attend
the Federal Structure Committee also.
Asked whether he had finally decided to go to the London Conference and when
he was likely to start, Gandhiji said that the Working Committee would decide all
those questions for him. His theory and views had been exploded and he would
willingly obey whatever the Committee asked him to do.
Asked whether the situation in Gujarat was satisfactory, after hesitating for a
while, Gandhiji replied that the situation was not satisfactory. But he had been
corresponding with the Government of India. Incidentally, he mentioned that he had
been receiving reports from all over India forwarded by reliable trusted workers like
Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, that a deliberate policy of repression of strictly peaceful
picketing, in the shape of faked prosecutions, physical interference and lathi charges
was hindering the working of the Settlement. None of these complaints had escaped
his attention, and he could not publish them as he was carrying on delicate
negotiations with the Central Government from and through which he expected to
gain relief. He hoped that things would not assume serious proportions as to endanger
the Truce. He had one word to say to Congressmen, that the safety and honour of the
Congress demanded meticulous performance by the Congressmen of all the
conditions of the Truce.
Gandhiji proposed to place the Working Committee in full possession of all
the complaints.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      423Gandhiji profoundly regretted the failure of the efforts in Bhopal to effect a
settlement between the two sections of the Muslim group. It was a very unfortunate
incident. The Working Committee would discuss what next should be done in view of
the failure.
Gandhiji was confident that the Foreign-cloth Export Scheme would prove a
success and the scheme did not amount to a breach of the Truce as alleged by certain
interested parties.
Is the contention made by a new political school of thought to the effect that
the Congress, by accepting the Truce, accepted the principle of Federation as
enunciated in the last R.T.C. true? If so where does the Congress resolution of
Indepcndence passed at the Lahore Congress and reiterated at Karachi stand?
A. This question need not be answered.

BOMBAY,
June 25, 1931
Mr. Gandhi said he was aware of the position, but it was an article of faith with
him that the use of any foreign manufactured articles in the composition of cloth
turned out by Indian mills was detrimental to the interests of the masses. He explained
his view at some length and regretted his inability to deflect from the course [in spite]
of any disadvantage, which might accrue to the industry, which he thought would
only be of a temporary character.
Gandhiji however realized very fully the menace of Japanese competition, and
said he would leave no stone unturned to deal with it effectively. The Congress policy
was certainly not intended to merely restrict imports from Lancashire, but all imports
of foreign cloth, and he would direct particular attention to the growing menace from
Japan. If and when a satisfactory settlement was reached, Japanese competition might
be dealt with by means of a special tariff. The whole position was one which would
have to be seriously considered in the nearest future.

Saklatwala, and Lalji Naranji. The discussion turned on the increasing imports of
Japanese piece-goods, particularly artificial silk goods. It was pointed out that while
the industry was being asked to give up the use of artificial silk yarn, Japanese
imports of this class of goods were increasing at an alarming rate, disorganizing trade
not merely in artificial silk goods, but also in other varieties.424       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI562. SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, BOMBAY
June 26, 1931
Mahatma Gandhi first congratulated the women of India and particularly the
women of Bombay for the great and heroic part they had taken in the last fight. They
had shown unparalleled courage and their capacity to suffer and make supreme
sacrifices in the cause of the country was fully tested. When Gandhiji started on his
pilgrimage to Dandi1 he had entrusted to the women of India a twofold mission.
Firstly the women of India must help the nation to exterminate all foreign cloth and
secondly they must help to enforce total prohibition. Gandhiji entrusted this task to
the women, having full faith that it would be carried out. What the women had
achieved by selfless work and during such a short time was far beyond his most
sanguine hopes.
The women of India, proceeded Gandhiji, had enhanced the prestige of the
whole nation. They were the cynosure of all eyes. The whole world looked up to them
with admiration for their patriotism. But that was not enough. The praise that was
showered on them by the world must encourage them to look forward to their future
work with greater faith and zeal.
They should with more vigour carry out the work entrusted to them during the
fight. They should persuade dealers in foreign cloth as well as consumers to shun
foreign cloth. They should beg of those who are addicted to drink to give up the vice
and they should induce the dealers in liquor to stop the evil traffic. During the last
fight men and women volunteered their services for this work but now this task had
become more onerous and difficult. There was both laxity in work and lack of
workers.
The need for a regular and disciplined army of workers was therefore all the
greater. They should not be disappointed by the results of their efforts. If they had
complete faith in their mission and believed that they were going to succeed, it would
not only be possible to exterminate foreign cloth from India but also root out the
drink evil in a short time. But this kind of work required discipline and united efforts.
He noticed among the audience a few women wearing the orange colour saris but a
majority of them did not wear this emblem. This colour was symbolic of the
dedication of their services in the cause of the country. It also indicated that they were
members of the local organization of women which carried out the mission of boycott
and prohibition.
1  On March 12, 1930; ads Vol. XLIII.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      425My appeal to you women, therefore, is to come out and adopt
this symbol of the orange colour sari and join the band of those brave
and selfless women whose services are pledged to the country.
He then sounded a note of warning to such of the women who took to khaddar
during the last struggle but were now tempted to go in for foreign fineries. It had been
brought to his notice that a few Khoja1 women who had taken part in the movement
and had become converts to the gospel of khaddar were now showing an inclination
to buy foreign cloth. This was not the case with Khoja women alone but Hindu women
also. If they had the slightest regard and pity for the millions of their countrymen
who were facing starvation and worse they should cease patronizing foreign cloth.
They should prefer either khaddar or India-made cloth to the exclusion of all
foreign cloth. But he would point out that Indian mill-cloth was meant for those to
whom the message of the starving millions had not reached and for such persons who
were not of Congress persuasion. But every Congressman and woman and everyone
who believed in the Congress creed must adopt khaddar and khaddar alone even to the
exclusion of mill-cloth.
No doubt the use of mill-cloth would benefit a few lakhs of workers living in
industrial towns, a few thousands of shareholders and a smaller number of agents and
directors. But there were seven lakhs of villages in India and 30 crores of
poverty-stricken peasants in them. Should one place the interest of 30 crores of
peasants first or a few lakhs of industrial workers ? Their duty should be to relieve the
poverty of the 30 crores of peasants by patronizing khaddar and khaddar alone.
Mahatmaji thought that the best education for girls and women was not the
kind of university education that they were getting in schools but that they should be
taught thoroughly to master the art of spinning and carding. The message of the
charkha must be popularized throughout the length and breadth of the country and
women were best fitted for the propagation of this message. If every woman learnt to
spin and cultivated the habit of wearing only selfmade khaddar clothes they would go
a long way in winning their freedom. [Concluding, Gandhiji said:]
In khaddar alone lies your salvation and in your salvation lies
the salvation of your country.

1  A Muslim community426       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI563. SPEECH TO ‘DEPRESSED’ CLASSES DEPUTATION1
BOMBAY,
June 26, 1931
Gandhiji said in reply to the address:
Don’t call me a Mahatma, but call me a Bhangi.
He said that he appreciated the title “Pioneer of Scavengers”, once given to
him by a European friend rather than the title “Mahatma”. He promised the
deputationists that everything that he would urge at the Round Table Conference
would be in the interest of their community and the country in general. He would not
promise that the very same formula suggested by the deputation will be placed before
the Conference but if a better one suggested itself to him he would give it preference.
As regards providing educational facilities to the ‘depressed’ classes, Mahatmaji
would like to do much more than was suggested to him.
But Gandhiji was himself not sure whether the present Settlement with the
Government was a temporary settlement or permanent one. If it was a permanent one
and swaraj was achieved, then many of the problems concerning the ‘depressed’
classes could be at once tackled. Of this much he was sure, that owing to the great
awakening of the people the stigma of untouchability would soon disappear
altogether from the country.
Mahatmaji wanted to say how much the Congress had been doing for the uplift
and general advancement of the ‘depressed’ classes. After the question of
untouchability was taken up by the Congress, it had spent more than 20 lakhs of
rupees for starting ashrams and schools for ‘depressed’ classes and untouchable
classes where free education was imparted. There was a network of ashrams in Gujarat
where ‘depressed’ class boys were taught free.

BORSAD,

DEAR SIR,
I thank you for your exhaustive letter of 23rd inst. No. 43-
14/301. It will be impossible for me to get hold of the purchaser of the
muchwa and induce him to part with the thing he has got admittedly
so cheap. The sale of the muchwa being after the Settlement, was
clearly in breach of it and was due to the negligence of the official at
Surat. The only proper course in my opinion is to pay the owner the
market price of the muchwa, which, I understand, is Rs. 200. But I
have no evidence in support of my statement beyond the one made by
the owner. There should be no difficulty in ascertaining the market
price. I hope that the course suggested by me would be adopted
without delay. The poor owner naturally has to suffer loss whilst he
remains without a muchwa.
Yours sincerely,

MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
I have your letter and your postcard. I am glad the notice under
Sec. 144 in Rae Bareli has been withdrawn. It was undoubtedly due to
1  I n which the addressee had proposed that his department “will consider the
question of refunding the amount of Rs. 50 realized in the auction sale to the present
owner of the muchwa [a small boat] if the latter is willing to return the muchwa to its
original owner, and provided the Central Board of Revenue agree to this compromise
suggested by me. . . .”430       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIyour clear letter to the Chief Secretary. By the time you reach
Bombay for the Working Committee, the Committee should be ready
to give definite guidance.
I am quite convinced that in order to complete our case it is
necessary for you to ask the Governor to see you. In seeking the
interview you will tell him that you want to leave no stone unturned to
see that the clear position is placed before the highest authority in the
province. You may bring nothing from the Governor but our position
will surely be the stronger for your having made the attempt to see
him and to secure fulfilment of the Settlement. We shall lose nothing
by your offering to see him and seeing him if he accepts the offer.
You might have seen in Young India what I wrote about the
happenings in Unao District.1 I am going to write again on the
material supplied by you and others.
It was unfortunate that the Working Committee had to be
postponed. Vallabhbhai was strongly against going to Allahabad in
the present circumstances there. I think too that what with Cawnpore
and the other excitement in U.P. it was better that Allahabad was
avoided for the time being.

Probably the cause of your not keeping well at the Ashram lies
in yourself. I believe that we can train the body to adjust itself to any
place. The main factor is food. Through experiments one can find out
what food suits one in a particular season. There is no doubt, more-
over, that much depends on one’s mind. Hence, if you are very eager
to go and live in the Vidyapith, you may go there after obtaining the
permission of Narandasbhai and Chhaganbhai. You may stay
wherever you think you will keep good health.

I got both your letters. You seem to feel worried and upset. If
you are very much worked, come over for a day.
“Never lose heart”1 means that, if we get unhappy experiences
in society or do not succeed immediately in our undertakings, we
should not give way to despair but should remain cheerful and go on
doing our work. This is what is meant by never losing heart.
By saying you are a member of the Managing Committee, I
tried to remind you of your responsibility and your powers You can
say in the Committee what you wish to and persuade it to accept your
proposal.
What I expect from you is this. Even if others lose heart, you
should not. Swallow all bitter draughts, go ahead and do the work
expected of you. This is what I want from you. All my expectations of
you concern strength of heart and not intellectual ability. The intellect
has less value, the heart has more. And the heart is something which
everyone has.
“Do not try to jump too high”2 means that, instead of planning
big things, you should try to improve what we are already doing. If
you are impatient to take up new things, the task on hand will suffer.
In my thoughts, I am always there. But how can I come away? I must
finish the task that has come to me unsought.

BORSAD,
June 29, 1931
Let the public know that the change of venue2 has nothing to do
with the order. Neither Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel nor I knew anything
about it when the change of venue was decided upon. The date and
venue had to be changed for the convenience of, and at the request of
Dr. Ansari, Maulana Abul Kalam and Mr. Mohamed Alam. Nevert-
heless, I am sorry for the order.
Some States do not seem to realize that at present there is
agreement between the Government and the Congress. Such an order
might therefore easily embarrass the Government which to the State is
the paramount power. Indeed, Dumas was thought of merely for its
being a seaside resort. Nobody dreamt that the Working Committee
meeting in the cool air of the sea near Dumas would harm Sachin.
However, I am thankful that the accident of the change of venue has
prevented an awkward situation arising. I hope, however,  that order
means no more than overzeal on the part of the District Magistrate of
Sachin.

578. LETTER TO H. W. EMERSON
BORSAD,
June 30, 1931
DEAR MR. EMERSON,
I have your lettcr of 23rd inst. setting forth objections raised
against the recent resolution of the Working Committee on boycott of
foreign cloth. I have re-read the resolution in the light of the objec-
tions raised and I have come to the conclusion that the objections are
based on an insufficient reading of the resolution and ignorance of
the previous history of the Congress policy in the matter. Long before
the civil disobedience campaign and ever since the Bengal Partition
days, boycott of foreign cloth and especially British cloth and general
British goods became the policy of the Congress. In 1920 boycott of
British goods was dropped at my instance and replaced by boycott of
foreign cloth on predominantly economic grounds and ever since it
has so remained. Whilst I was in Yeravda jail between 1922 and ‘24 a
resolution adopting boycott of British goods was passed at one of the
sessions of the Congress and since then, boycott of foreign cloth and
boycott of British goods have run on parallel lines. During the last
struggle these assumed an aggressive political character and became
practically merged. As a result of the Delhi Settlement, boycott of
British goods was discontinued and the effect of discontinuance was
so immediate that within a week of the Settlement orders for British436       THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHImachinery and other goods were freely sent. Boycott of foreign cloth
however remained not as a political weapon but as an economic
necessity. Thus complete prohibition of the sale of foreign cloth as an
economic necessity has been the settled Congress policy since 1920. It
was torn from its original anti-British setting. A mere pursuit of this
policy can in no sense be interpreted to mean interference with the
liberty of action of the individual unless the policy was enforced
through violent measures. But the history of the methods adopted by
the Congress since the Settlement, I think, furnishes sufficient evi-
dence to show that both the letter and the spirit of the Settlement have
been adhered to in the vast majority of cases by Congress organi-
zations and prompt measures have been taken wherever any departure
from peaceful methods has been detected.
Objection has been taken to the use of the word ‘permit’ in the
resolution in question. Of course the word has reference only to those
who put themselves under Congress discipline and so long as the
Congress retains the influence it has over the people, the use of the
word ‘permit’ is not only legitimate but necessary if the Congress
resolutions are to convey the intention of the authors. So long as the
Congress policy remains what it is, it is not open to Congress organi-
zations to permit all those under their influence importation of
foreign cloth even if individuals desired it.
As to disciplinary action the words of the resolution are surely
quite clear. Disciplinary action contemplated is “against the Commit-
tee or the individual as the case may be” and Committee or the indivi-
dual means only a Congress Committee or its individual members.
That all the obligation that is imposed by the Congress is purely moral
and devoid of any violence is abundantly clear from the fact that
breaches of pledges given to the Congress continue to be reported, the
Congress remaining helpless. At the same time it is to be confessed
that in a majority of cases the moral authority of the Congress is felt
and accepted by the people.
Lastly, I entirely endorse your remark that “it is most undesi-
rable that there should be any ground for misunderstanding as to the
attitude of the Congress in this matter.” And I assure you that mem-
bers of the Working Committee are most anxious to avoid any mis-
understanding, their desire being, for the good name of the CongressVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      437if for nothing else, to be meticulous in the performance of all the
obligations undertaken on behalf of the Congress in the Delhi

resister and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment was in the Gujarat

father died on the 22nd inst. His mother and brother died before his
father. There is only the widow left. Several representations, I hear,
have been made to the Punjab Government. No one knows why Pandit
Jagat Ram has not yet been discharged. This case has no connection
with the Settlement. I simply bring it to your notice so as to make an

DEAR MR. MAXWELL,
Syt. S. B. Joshi of Poona sends me a copy of a petition sent by

to thc civil disobedience campaign he tendered his resignation as
temporary supervisor in the Rohri Canal, No. IV division. As a result,
his name was put under a general ban which it appears was declared

BORSAD,
June 30, 1931
DEAR PRINCIPAL SHIRRAS,
I thank you for your letter of 25th instant, in reply to mine. I
understand that you have admitted all students but seven. There is
therefore, I presume, no question of want of accommodation. So far
as the internal discipline is concerned I suppose that what you regard
as indiscipline was more or less common to the majority of students.
But what perhaps you have in mind is that the seven students were
ring-leaders. I suggest that, if it was right to take the other students, it
would be wrong to keep out the ring-leaders. The Delhi Settlement
makes no such distinction between the leaders and the rank and file. I
would urge you, therefore, to take the remaining students and avoid a
possible crisis.
Yours sincerely,

MY DEAR CHARLIE,
I have your letter.
If I come there I shall tackle all the several matters which you
mention about Lancashire mills compared to Bombay mills. I may
deal with portions of your letter in Young India .
The difficulty about my going to London is still there. To get
anything done by the Government just now is like drawing a live
tooth. But bit by bit difficulties are being removed. I believe that the
Viceroy is sincerely anxious that I should go but I do not think he is
able to give much relief.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                      441Yes, the limit of five articles of food and the taking of meals
before sundown applies to India alone. In London, therefore, if the
system needs it, I shall be able to take more varied food. But so far as
milk is concerned cow’s milk and buffalo’s milk are taboo, and
naturally therefore products of these two milks.

I understand from the Government of India that people in
Nurpur Gorge and Kalabagh have been removing salt on a scale not
warranted by the Settlement, i.e., on camels and donkeys. No such
transport is permissible. People may carry for their own use or sale to
the poor people in the neighbourhood on their own backs and walk
the distance. No riding for sale is permissible. As a result the Govern-
ment inform me that the concession has been withdrawn from these

There is an endless stream of visiting friends whom I must not repel.

anyhody else asks for permission to translate the Atma Katha , I don’t
need to refer him to you. I will flatly refuse permission. I have a
vague recollection that Anil Babu of Shantiniketan did get from me
the permission years ago.
I am glad that your weight and strength are increasing. Remem-
ber the verse3 about fasting in the verses of the second chapter of the
Gita that we sing every evening. Fasting is good enough up to a point.
But if we are nervous about our perception of Truth and Ahimsa, the
moment we begin to satisfy real hunger, we have reached the danger
point, and our ascribing a bettcr perception of Truth and Ahimsa to
fasting or semi-fasting may be pure hallucination. Hard work must be
consistent with hard and clear thinking. Conversely, hard and clear
thinking I hold to be impossible if a person has become physically a
perfect wreck. A healthy mind in a healthy body is a correct maxim.
Love.

MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
I have your letter of 27th June, redirected from Bardoli.
Possibly you did not know that from Bombay I had come back to
Borsad because it has been necessary for Vallabhbhai and me to
divide our work. Danger is being averted by constant presence and
vigilance. But any day there might be a burst-up in Borsad. I have had
difficult experiences of working settlements in South Africa and even
getting the poor head broken1 in rendering a cent per cent account
from our side, and then had to get myself arrested in making the
Government render a tolerably good account of themselves. But I
thought that I had forgotten all about working settlements. Now,
however, I am reviving old memories and many of the experiences are
being repeated. My great satisfaction however is that whether war or
settlement, the nation must go forward if we remain faithful servers.
I like all your letters to the Chief Secretary. I do hope that the
Governor will consent to see you.
Here is a complaint against you. Please keep the typewritten
sheet and return it to me if you write about it or bring it with you and
you will tell me all about it when we meet.

MY  DEAR  MR.  GANDHI,
You will remember that, when I last saw you in Bombay, I promised to write to
His Excellency Sir Malcolm Hailey with the object of arranging for you to have an
interview with him. I wrote to him the next day and have just received a letter from
him. He has been unable to reply before, because he has been busy in studying the
revenue and rent position. He feels that is is no use discussing the matter with you
until he is fully informed of the facts and is clear in his own mind what relief is
necessary. In other words, he wants to be quite sure that any assurance he may give
you will cover the case. At present, reports from all districts have not come in; but Sir
Malcolm Hailey hopes to be fully acquainted with the situation within a week and in a
position to discuss it. I will let you know when I hear further from him.
2.I am sorry to see in the papers that you have not been fit, and I hope the
reports were not true, or, if they were true, that you are now alright again.

NOTE BY H. W. EMERSON ON INTERVIEW BETWEEN HIMSELF AND
GANDHIJI1
Confidential
I had prolonged discussions with Mr. Gandhi on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th
of May on matters arising out of the Settlement, also incidentally on general
questions.
2.The first subject of importance discussed was the situation in Gujarat.
Particular matters raised were the followings :
(a)Mr. Gandhi said that in the Kaira District, and particularly in the Borsad
Taluka, matters were on the whole proceeding very satisfactorily owing to the system
of co-operation between himself and Mr. Perry, the Collector. He said that the people
were paying land revenue as quickly as they could and that he was satisfying himself
by personal enquiry into cases that they were paying as much as their circumstances
would permit. He was worried about the question of unauthorized arrears. He said that
it was common ground that those who could pay the current demand and arrears should
pay; but there would be undoubtedly numerous cases in which revenue payers were
able to pay the current ones, but would not be able to pay arrears; that what he would
like was a declaration of announcement from the local Government of a general
character that in  such cases the arrears would be automatically suspended. He argued
that when   the arrears of those who had not joined the Civil Disobedience Movement
had   been suspended and so had become authorized arrears, there was a stronger reason
for suspending the arrears of those who had suffered a great deal from the Civil
Disobedience Movement and were, therefore, prima facie  in a worse position to  pay.
I said that, so far as I understood the case, there had been no general suspension   of
the demand in cases of those who had not joined the Civil Disobedience Movement,
but that in accordance with the ordinary system of land revenue administration certain
arrears had been suspended where there was sufficient reason. It could not be assumed
that because people had joined in the civil disobedience movement, they were,
therefore, less able to pay than people who had not joined in it. Of those who had
joined many had not suffered serious loss, a good number had suffered no loss at all,
and in any case the test was not the losses they had suffered, but their present capacity
to pay. I did not, therefore, see how a general order could be issued. He then said that
many revenue-payers were paying money representing the current demand and, in
some cases, also part of the arrears, on the understanding that this represented all that
they could pay at present, and that the balance of the arrears would be suspended, that
Government officers were taking these sums, knowing what the intentions of the
1 Vide “Interview to the Press”, 15-5-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        451people were and that a very difficult situation would arise if later coercive processes
were issued for the balance. I said that it would clearly not be possible for
Government to accept the position that the tax-payers should determine what amount
of Government dues should be paid. He admitted this as a general proposition, but
said that where, as at present in Kaira, he himself and other Congress workers in
pursuance of the Settlement were satisfying themselves that people were paying as
much as they could pay, the position was different, and that they became  more or less
involved in the transaction. I suggested to him that all Congress workers in Gujarat
were inspired by the same honesty of purpose as he himself, and   that for this reason
also the Collector had to satisfy himself that there was a case for suspension, that my
information was that in some parts of Gujarat revenue payers were being encouraged
not to pay unauthorized arrears, although many of them were  able to do so. I assumed
generally that neither the local Government nor the local officers desire to squeeze
money out of persons who could not pay and that it really resolved itself into a
question of good faith. If the Congress and the people genuinely played up and paid
all they could pay, then I imagined nobody would wish to resort to coercive
processes. If, on the other hand, they did not play up, I did not see how coercive
processes would be avoided. At any rate it was not necessary to take this particular
fence at the present time, and it would be sufficient to consider any difficulty, if and
when it arises.
My general impression about this part of the conversation was that Mr.
Gandhi foresees trouble in regard to the collection of unauthorized arrears, and that
while he is playing the game in Borsad, attempts are being made elsewhere to defer
the payment of unauthorized arrears on a large scale under the cover of inability to
pay. The nature of the difficulty that is likely to arise will depend on the extent to
which this movement succeeds, but if complications are to be avoided, it will
probably be necessary for the local officers not to press collection of unauthorized
arrears in cases where there will be real difficulty in paying.
(b)We had a long talk about the reinstatement of village officials. Mr.
Gandhi made the point that no new Patels had been appointed permanently in the
sense that they had been appointed for life and that the appointments were for a term
of years, e.g., 3, 5, or 10 years, and that even these were subject to further notice. He
contended that such appointments could not be treated as permanent and that they
were not, therefore, completely protected under para 19 of the Statement of the 5th of
March. I told him that I understood that this particular system of appointment was
usual and that it was not the practice in Gujarat even if normal times to appoint Patels
permanently in the sense in which he used the word. The local Government take the
view that “permanently” means substantively and that this was at least a reasonable
interpretation. Personally I did not press this, because I knew that when this clause
was under discussion in New Delhi, neither Lord Irwin nor Mr. Gandhi was aware of452      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIthe fact that the appointments made had been of this character, and the impression
was that they were either of a permanent or purely temporary character. The actual
wording of the clause did not, however, affect the broad principle which underlay this
and similar provisions. That principle was that where third party rights had been
created, the local Government were under an obligation to protect the rights and this
principle obviously applied to appointments for a term of years. It might be
contended that when the third party rights so created had been  satisfied, then effect
should be given to the Settlement and return should be made to the status quo ante ;
instance at the end of an appointment of three years the claims of the original holder,
if in the meantime there was no cause of disqualification against him, might be given
preferential treatment. This seemed to be a view of the case which the local
Government might be inclined to take, but I could not commit them in any way. Mr.
Gandhi was not very satisfied with this, but felt, I think, that he was not in a strong
position.
He then pursued another line, namely, that it was generally recognized that the
new men who had been put in were unable to carry on the work, that in many cases
they were criminals or of bad character, that in fact they were unable to collect the
land revenue and it was the resigned Patel who had been doing this work; that there
could be no peace in a village where a new Patel had been appointed until he was
removed from it; and that in the interest of good administration a remedy should be
found either by compensating  the new Patels or by finding them jobs elsewhere. I
said that, so far as I knew, the local officers were quite prepared to enquire into
bonafide  complaints against particular Patels, but they of course had to protect them
against frivolous complaints; that the third  party right in such cases was the right to
a particular appointment; and that com-  pensation would not be regarded by the
Patels themselves as a satisfaction of those   rights. Something might perhaps be
done to ease what was admittedly a difficult   problem by putting in Patels who had
resigned in vacancies elsewhere as they occur; but I did not know whether this was, in
fact, practicable. This question evidently is also causing him a good deal of concern.
(c)In regard to the repurchase of lands that had been sold, he appeared to be
fairly happy. He was very critical of the difficulties experienced in ascertaining what
lands had been sold and at what price; but he admitted that the present arrangement
under which the entries relating to all such transactions have been or will shortly be
entered up in the village registers, to which the public have access, would meet the
requirements of the case. He said that he was having more success in getting back
lands from Dharalas than he had anticipated, and in fact he was getting on better with
them than with others in regard to whom he had not expected so much difficulty. I
asked him why Garda had repudiated his transaction. He would not admit that Garda
had any reasonable cause for complaint against the Congress for any deviation from
their side of the bargain and said he was in correspondence with Sir CowasjeeVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        453Jehangir.
He said that in some cases in the Kaira District land had been forfeited for
arrears of land revenue, had then been declared to be Government property and had
been sold, that none of the sale price had been credited to the account of the defaulter,
and that, in fact, the amount in regard to which the land had been forfeited was still
being demanded. I expressed doubts about this, although I did understand that where
land had been forfeited the whole of the sale price had been credited to Government,
even although this exceeded the amount of the demand. I gathered that the Collector
of Kaira had referred this question to the local Government and they will doubtless
consider, if cases, such as stated by mr. Gandhi, have actually occurred, whether the
collection of the demand in addition to forfeiture of the land is not unduly severe.
On the whole Mr. Gandhi was more happy about Gujarat than he was when I
last saw him, and the situation there has undoubtedly improved. He himself appears to
have worked very hard to get things cleared up, but there appear to be several
troublesome matters ahead and these may create difficulties, especially where Gandhi
has not tried his hand and Vallabhbhai’s influence has been at work.
I may observe that during the course of the discussion about Gujarat and also
on one or two other occasions Mr. Gandhi dropped the claim, if he ever seriously
entertained it, that Congress should be recognized as an intermediary between
Government and the people, although he did claim, and not without reason, that
where, as in the case of   Kaira, the local officers are co-operating with himself and
other workers, action  should be avoided which will embarrass him and his helpers,
unless it is clear that they are not playing the game. I tackled him about the
statements attributed to   him in the Press that he had advised revenue payers not to
pay land revenue if they  had to borrow to do so on interest. I told him that this was a
principle that Govern- ment could not accept, that it was a well-known fact that
revenue payers had often to borrow money in order to meet their revenue demands, and
that if I had credit at the Bank, my creditors would not let me off, because I had no
ready cash. He admitted that in ordinary circumstances his advice was not justifiable,
but on the merits of this particular case he eliminated further argument by saying that
in Kaira, where the advice was given, the Collector had accepted the principle as a
working basis.
3.We then had some discussion about salt, which was resumed later in
connection with a reference from the Central Board of Revenue. The main points,
which were raised, were the following :
(a)Mr. Gandhi is anxious that Government should issue some
communication amplifying the relevant clause of the Statement of March 5th, so that
persons entitled to the concession will know more about its character. I showed him
the lengthy and detailed circulars issued by the Central Board of Revenue for various454      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIareas, and explained to him, what I understand to be the view of the Central Board of
Revenue, namely, that while these were necessary for departmental guidance, they
were too complicated to be of real assistance to the public, that in fact specific
difficulties were still continually cropping up, that these were being dealt with ad hoc
in a liberal and practical spirit, and that until the various points had been settled the
publication of a detailed statement would in any case be premature. Moreover,
anything in the nature of a lengthy statement would probably give rise to questions
of hypothetical character, which it was better not to raise. Mr. Gandhi accepted all
this and said that he had not intended anything in the nature of a long statement, but
that he felt it very desirable that the main principles should be published. I suggested
that he should try his hand on a draft and Government would then see whether it could
be accepted by them with such modifications as might be necessary. He promised to
let me have one.
(b)He then got on to the question of the fish-curing industry. I told him that
I understood that this matter was already under consideration by the Central Board of
Revenue, who had addressed the Madras Government. Briefly the points which he
made were the followings :—
(i)Fishermen along the East and West Coast already enjoy the concession
of duty free salt.
(ii)On the West Coast, where fish curing is carried on by contractors in
special yards, salt has to be purchased from Government. Mr. Gandhi agreed that this
was quite right and that the salt concession should not be extended to the fish-curing
industry when the curing is done on a big scale by contractors.
(iii)He said, however, that even on the West Coast there was a certain
amount of curing done by fishermen in their own homes, that it was carried on as a
domestic and not as a big scale industry, and that it was reasonable to allow the
concession in such cases.
I declined to express any opinion in ignorance of the facts, but promised to let
the C.B.R. know the gist of the Conversation.
(c)I then mentioned to him the case reported by the Collector of Salt
Revenue, Bombay, in which it was said that Congress workers were making salt in
works situated on privately owned land at Shiroda, that there was a fairly large force
of labour employed, and that a stock of salt of 500 to 600 maunds was being
collected. We were agreed that the salt concession did not anticipate that Congress
would come in as an organization engaged in the manufacture of salt, and he admitted
that an impossible situation would arise if local Congress organizations as such took
up the manufacture of salt even for the purpose included in the Settlement. He also
admitted that if salt is being manufactured at Shiroda by paid labour, then this is not
covered by the Settlement, but he claimed that if the villagers entitled to theVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        455concession had combined for the manufacture of salt and were making it themselves
and not through paid labour, then the case was covered by the Settlement provided the
relevant provisions of the Settlement were observed. He also claimed that the mere
manufacture of a stock of 500 or 600 maunds did not necessarily constitute a breach,
since it was natural that the people concerned should manufacture a sufficient quantity
of salt to see them over the close period. He claimed to be acquainted with the facts of
the manufacture at Shiroda, and the C.B.R. may find it necessary to collect further
information in regard to them before they can reach a decision. If it is decided that the
facts do not preclude this system of manufacture, then a practical solution may be to
limit the quantity of salt to be manufactured in accordance with an estimate of local
requirements.
(d)Mr. Gandhi agreed that the practical test of removal on foot should not
include the removal of manufactured salt by gangs of coolies.
4.Mr. Gandhi then mentioned the matter of releases of prisoners, about
which we had a general and somewhat infructuous talk. He still seems to think that
there are cases which come within the amnesty in which releases have not been
granted, and he promised to let me have lists of these. I told him that we had sent the
previous lists to local Governments, and the replies we had so far received definitely
indicated that local Governments had very scrupulously honoured the Settlement in
this respect. I mentioned the case of the Punjab list in which, for lack of accurate
information, the local Government had been unable to identify a number of prisoners
mentioned, and of   the 75 who had been identified 47 had been released before the list
was sent. This  went to show that the information supplied to Mr. Gandhi was
inaccurate. I also reminded him that local Governments generally have interpreted the
Settlement  very liberally in cases of technical violence and that while they have
been more   strict in cases of incitement to violence, there are good reasons for this.  I
took the opportunity of reminding him that within the last three weeks there have
been three incidents connected with the terrorist movement in the Punjab   alone,
namely, the Shalimar affair, the Sialkot incident and the very recent bomb explosion
in the Jullundur District. He had not heard of the last and was shocked to hear that the
two persons concerned were connected with the Congress. He agreed that local
Governments were justified in taking a serious view of incitement to violence, and he
did not attempt to raise the question of cases under section 124 A., I.P.C., and section
108, Criminal Procedure Code, which at one time threatened to be a matter of
controversy. Two cases appeared to be worrying him. One was the case of an editor1
convicted in Sholapur, in regard to which he urges that there was neither violence nor
incitement to violence, and the second case was one from the Surat District, where a
youth had been convicted for arson. His crop had been attached, and he then set fire to
1 Emerson has made a note here : “He has since been released.”456      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIit. Mr. Gandhi then attempted to argue that violence within the terms of the
Settlement had reference only to violence to person and that, therefore, this particular
incident was not violence. This of course could not be accepted. I understood that he
was in correspondence in regard to both cases with the local Government.
He wanted to know what was to happen if there were a deadlock between
Congress and the local Government in regard to particular cases. I said that the
intention was that the local Government should be the final authority, that so far no
such case has arisen, and we might wait and see. The Government of India had in the
case of several representations made to them requested local Governments to inform
them of the facts, and since neither the Government of India nor any local
Government has any desire to evade the obligations of the Settlement, there is no
reason to suppose that a solution will not be found if there is any particular case in
which there has been a genuine mistake. I informed him that local Governments had
attached very great importance to this part of the Settlement and that in some
province the Governor had himself scrutinized all doubtful cases. I imagine that Mr.
Gandhi is being given a good deal of trouble by provincial Congressmen in this
matter.
5.We then had a humorous discussion about bicycles and a motor-car
which led up to the case of the Young India  Press.
Under clause 16 of the Statement Government have agreed to return movable
property, not being an illegal possession, which was seized during the civil
disobedience movement and which at the time of the Settlement was still in the
possession of Government. A motor-car was seized in the Kaira District and was quite
properly used for official purposes. It is now, I gathered, in a somewhat dilapidated
condition and is out of action at some distance from its original home. Mr. Gandhi
claims that it should be returned at the place where it was seized. The local officers
will not admit this, and I gather that they cannot, in any case, return it there, either
by putting it into running condition or transporting it as scrap iron. This led us on to
what was the real purport of the matter, namely, the Press of Young India . This was
seized in Ahmedabad under the Press Ordinance and is of considerable value. Part of it
is still in Ahmedabad, while part of it was sent to Bombay for sale. Mr. Gandhi claims
as a right that he is entitled to its delivery at Ahmedabad, and he has recently
addressed the Bombay Government on the subject. He made it clear that he did not
want the Bombay portion of the press returned to him at Ahmedabad as a matter of
grace, if he was not entitled to this under the Settlement. I promised that we would
look into the legal aspect of the case, and if necessary, address the local
Government.1 He on his part promised that if the decision is in his favour he will not
use it for vexatious purposes, e.g., the return of a useless motor-car.
1 Gandhiji subsequently received a letter turning down the claim.VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        4576.Under the same clause of the Settlement he raised the question of the
return of arms, the licences of which had been cancelled in connection with the Civil
Disobedience Movement. He had mentioned this before at previous talks, but I had
not appreciated the fact that the claim was under the clause, and had imagined that
what he desired was a more liberal policy within the spirit of the Settlement in re-
granting licences when previous ones had been cancelled. I told him that, so far as the
clause was concerned it seemed to me that as soon as an arms’ licence was cancelled,
the arm became an illegal possession and that, therefore, the case was not covered. In
any case, even if the clause did technically apply, local Governments would
obviously be unwilling to return arms  where there was reason to suppose that these
arms might be used for terrorist  purposes, and this applied particularly to the Punjab
and Bangal. Mr. Gandhi   accepted this as reasonable and said that a way out of the
difficulty might be found by formally returning the arms, cancelling the new licences
and recovering them. I suggested that this would lead to a good deal of friction. I
promised to have the legal aspect examined.
I explained that if the matter did not come within the scope of the Settlement,
there were difficulties in addressing local Governments in regard to the re-grant of
licences, that the Arms Rules gave wide discretionary powers to District Magistrates
in regard to the grant and cancellation of licences, and that while it did not seem
improvable that they would take a reasonable view in the case of licences cancelled
during the civil disobedience movement when the licensees were responsible
persons, they would be sticky before giving licences to persons about whom they
were not satisfied.
7.He then mentioned the case of restoration of pensions forfeited during 
the Civil Disobdience Movement. I said that this had not been discussed  with local
Governments; previous to the Settlement and that they and the   Army Department in
the case of military pensions would certainly take strong exception to the restoration
of military and police pensions, and that, this   being so, it would be difficult for
them to discriminate in favour of other civil pensions. Local Governments would,
however, doubtless consider in the ordinary course of business any applications made
to them, but I did not see how the Government of India could make any general
suggestion to them on this matter. Mr. Gandhi recognized the difficulty of restoring
military and police pensions and did not press the matter.
8.Mr. Gandhi mentioned the case of boys and students who had been
expelled from educational institutions on account of participation in the Civil
Disobedience Movement. He said that in several provinces they were being allowed
to return only on condition that they gave a declaration that they would take no part
in politics. He seemed to think this was wrong. I explained to him that in some
Government’s institutions in the Pubjab (and probably else-where) such declarations
were taken from students on first entry—let alone from students who were allowed re-458      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIadmission after expulsion; that the latter were fortunate to be allowed to return and
knowing the importance that local Government rightly attached to discipline in
schools and colleges. I saw no point in raising this matter with them, even if the
Government of India were prepared to take a more lenient view which I did not think
they would.
9.We next got on to the important question of the North-West Frontier
Province. I had a preliminary talk with hin on one matter, giving him the main facts
as known to us, and Mr. Howell later joined us and explained the peculiar difficulties
of the Frontier situation. The points on which I laid emphasis in the preliminary
discussion were :
(1)Abdul Ghaffar’s activities and speeches since the amnesty.
(2)His continued insistence on the Settlement being a truce and therefore a
period of preparation.
(3)The continuous recruitment of Red Shirts, their organization, drilling,
etc.
(4)Abdul Ghaffar’s attempt to spread agitation across the border.
(5)His deliberate and discourteous refusal to see the Chief Commissioner or
local officials.
 (6)The encouragement he has given to the non-payment of land revenue and
the consequent effects on the land revenue administration of the Peshawar
District.
(7)The increase in crime that has occurred there.
I suggested to Mr. Gandhi that even in other provinces where we might
tolerate and had, in fact, tolerated in the past the recruitment of Congress volunteers
up to a certain point, we could not even in those provinces tolerate either the
unlimited recruitment of volunteers or the establishment of bodies of trained
volunteers. The fact that their immediate activities were comparatively harmless was
not a decisive test. We had to look to the use to which they might be put, and if at any
time we came   to the conclusion that they constituted a serious menace to future
peace, we might have  to take action. At any rate, we obviously could not accept the
argument that because   we do not think it necessary at present to take action against
Congress volunteers in a particular province, therefore our hands are tied either in
regard to volunteers generally or in regard to volunteers in places where they do
constitute a menace; nor, having regard to the peculiar conditions in the North-West
Frontier Province the obvious danger of the Red Shirt Movement being
misunderstood in tribal territory and its possible effects in Afghanistan, could we
regard its extension with equanimity. Mr. Gandhi appreciated these peculiar
difficulties, but was inclined to attach weight to Abdul Ghaffar’s own statement of the
case, which appeared in the Press a few days ago and in which he naturally attemptedVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        459to place the odium on the local administration.
The further discussion of the matter is given in Mr. Howell’s note below :
“By arrangement with Mr. Emerson I went yesterday afternoon to interview
Mr. Gandhi. Before I arrived Mr. Emerson had already dissuaded Mr. Gandhi from his
intention of visiting the North-West Frontier Province and had secured from him a
promise to get into touch either personally or by letter with Abdul Ghaffar Khan and
induce the latter at least to examine and reconsider his methods if not to abandon, at
any rate temporarily, his campaign. There was therefore very little for me to do
except   to go over the ground again, and this I did with the special idea of impressing
upon   Mr. Gandhi the dangers of Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s programme in the Frontier
Province. The gist of what Mr. Emerson and I said to him in the course of the
interview was as follows :
We had no intention of questioning Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s sincerity, but we did
think the wisdom of his procedure open to question. Why for instance had he steadily
refused to have an interview with the Chief Commissioner who had shown exemplary
patience and had done his best to get into contact with him? If they were bound to fall
out at a later stage, was that any reason for not walking together so far as their ways
lay together? Again was it wise to stage an exciting drama in the presence of an
exceedingly excitable audience, such as the frontier tribes, all of them well armed, and
many of them only waiting for a favourable opportunity to go and loot the box
office? If Mr. Gandhi thought this was prudent, let him listen to what Bhai Parmanand
and other Frontier Hindus, who had reason to know what they were talking about, had
recently been saying at Lahore. The basic fact of the situation was that, as these
frontier Hindus realize, security for life and property on the Frontier, especially Hindu
life and property, and the whole stability of society depended on the maintenance of
respect for the existing Government. And if the Frontier tribes, who were never tired
of proclaiming themselves to be as good as or better than anybody else, saw Abdul
Ghaffar Khan here, or X there, or Y in another place successfully defying
Government, they too might be tempted to   take a hand in the same game. Hence the
paramount importance of preventing the  Red Shirts Movement from being spread
across the border. Once there it could not   fail to take on a militant form and, as last
summer in Waziristan, might assume the appearance of a pro-Amanullah campaign
which would cause anxiety to King   Nadir.
Throughout stress was laid not on the contention that tribal territory was
beyond the scope of the Civil Disobedience Movement, since that is dead or at any
rate dormant, or of the Irwin-Gandhi Pact, since that might give Mr. Gandhi a clue
that in the event of a further struggle he would do well to make a point of extending
activities into tribal territory, that being a weak spot on our side, but on the danger,
especially the danger to Hindu life and property, to which opposition to Government460      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIin the Frontier region was likely to lead. He was asked whether in his opinion it was
wise for anyone conducting a difficult and an unprecedented experiment, such as is
now in progress throughout India, to begin by tampering with the breakwater which
keeps the flood waters out. Mr. Gandhi seemed to grasp the point of this question.
We also put Sir Steuart Pears’ remaining points to Mr. Gandhi, and asked him
to consider whether there really could be any use for such a body of men as 13,000,
the latest figure we had had—admittedly only an estimate— of the number of Red
Shirts. Finally the revenue situation, with special reference to Peshawar District, was
discussed at some length, and Mr. Gandhi was informed of the startling rise in the
figures of crime. He wished to know how land and water rates compared in Peshawar
with the adjoining districts in the Punjab and seemed surprised to learn that, while
agricultural conditions in the irrigated area of the Peshawar District generally
compared favourably with anything in northern India, rates of land revenue and water
rates were distinctly lower than in the adjoining districts of the Punjab. This Mr.
Gandhi’s interlocutors thought might be taken as fair evidence of the constant Pathan
tendency to have things both ways at which the Pathan is an adept and frequently
successful. Mr. Gandhi took note of this and also of the fact that liberal remissions
had been, were being and would be granted according to the necessities of the case. He
seemed disposed to agree that whatever the land revenue policy of the future
Government might be, it was perhaps bad tactics to interfere too much with revenue
collection under the existing regime. On Mr. Gandhi’s side a promise was given that
he would send for Abdul Ghaffar Khan as soon as possible, and in the meantime would
both telegraph and write to him.”
10.We had some talk about the boycott and the attitude of Lancashire. Mr.
Gandhi was more sorrowful than resentful about the latter. He claimed that the
Settlement had produced a great change in the position regarding the boycott of
foreign cloth, that there had been a very large reduction in picketing, that
discrimination against British cloth had ceased and that while there were still causes
of complaint these should be regarded in the light of the situation as a whole and not
advanced as though they represented the general position. He claimed (and I believe
rightly) that he was doing his utmost to secure the strict observance of the Settlement
and he asked that any breaches of it should be at once brought to his notice.
I admitted the truth of a great deal of what he said; but gave him a number of
illustrations of the sort of thing that was going on, and in particular, dwelt on the
prevalence of social pressure. I said that the general impression was that freedom of
action of the individual has not been secured and that it was this belief that was
responsible for reactions in Lancashire, which were of first-class political
importance in England. I emphasized the harm that was being done by every instance
of violation of the Settlement that was communicated to the British Press and I dweltVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        461at length on a particular case that had come to the notice of Government. This case is
briefly as  follows :
“The British Goods Boycott Committee of Ahmedabad sent a letter, dated the
7th of April 1931, to the Cawnpore Chemical Works, Cawnpore, asking them various
questions, among which were the following :
(a)Do you use any British materials in the process of manufacture?
(b)Has any Englishman or foreigner any interest whatever, either direct or
indirect, in your concern? If so, what is the extent of such interest?
Mr. Gavin Jones is very closely interested in this concern and sent the letter on to us.
We had enquiries made about it and were informed that the active workers on the
Committee were members of the Congress. After the Settlement the Committee
changed its name, but apparently sent out notices on the note paper with the old
heading and also included in their questions matters which directly offended against
the Settlement.”
I told Mr. Gandhi that in this particular case the attack was on the concern of
an Englishman, who was a member of the Round Table Conference Delegation and
who had strongly supported the Indian case in London. It would hardly be a matter of
surprise if activities of this kind were to make Europpeans doubtful of their previous
attitude and that if this particular instance were communicated to the British Press or
raised in Parliament, it could not fail to have very unfortunate results. Mr. Gandhi
admitted all this and expressed regret that the matter had not been brought to his
notice even once. I said that we could not do this until we knew that Congress were
concerned in it and we had just received this information. I promised to let him have a
copy of the relevant correspondence, and he said he would have the matter put right at
once and let me know the results in a letter which Government could, if they thought
it desirable, communicate to Mr. Gavin Jones.
Mr. Gandhi is, I think, uneasy about the fulfilment of the boycott provi-
sions of the Settlement, and while he is as keen as ever on the replacement of  Indian
for foreign cloth and is convinced that the movement has come to stay, he   realizes
that methods of coercion and pressure will not succeed in the long run   and that any
abuse of the Settlement has adverse effects in India and in England   out of proportion
to the benefit to the movement itself. He has, however,  still to get his own
principles across to Congress organizations and workers  as a whole and although he
has done a good deal in this direction,   there is still much more to do. It will help if
local Government either directly tackle provincial Congress organizations in regard
to violation of the Settlement in this respect or communicate at once specific
instances to the Home Department to pass them on to Mr. Gandhi.
11.During the course of our talk with Mr. Gandhi a number of general
questions were incidentally discussed, and one sitting was almost entirely devoted to
big issues. An attempt is made below to summarize the points which arose.462      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIMr. Gandhi appears to have little hope at present of an early communal
settlement and realizes the bitterness of feeling. He expressed himself as reluctant to
go to England unless a solution is reached, for he would then feel that he could not
either with decency or consistency press for self-government when Indians them-
selves were at sixes and sevens. He is also sensitive as to taunts being made in this
respect. I took the following line with him :
(a)If there were no communal settlement in India, then the logical conclu-
sion of Mr. Gandhi to this would be that unless and until there were a settlement, there
could be no further advance in the constitutional field. Even if Mr. Gandhi himself felt
this, it was not possible for Government to accept it. Government had often been
accused of Machiavellian methods, and if it adopted the line taken by Mr. Gandhi
himself, there would be an immediate outcry accompanied by political agitation on an
intense scale. This must, therefore, be ruled out, and Government must assume
constitutional advance, even if no agreed communal settlement were reached. Why
should Mr. Gandhi take in this matter a more reactionary attitude than Government
were prepared to take? Moreover, even if a settlement were not reached in India, this
did not necessarily mean that one would not be reached in England. Conditions were
in some respects more favourable there than here : representations of various
interests would be in constant touch with each other; atmosphere would be better;
British leaders were prepared to give the greatest assistance possible and in fact an
agreement had almost been reached in London on the last occasion. Moreover, Lord
Irwin would be certainly ready to help. (Here at this point Mr. Gandhi made the
suggestion that Lord Irwin might even act as an arbitrator—an admission entirely
contrary to some of his previous declarations that Indians should settle among
themselves.) A settlement in London was more likely to be secured if Congress were
represented and Mr. Gandhi himself might be expected to play a considerable part in
it. In any case, he would not help by staying in India and, so far as the communal
question was concerned, his clear duty was to go to England.
I asked him what his friends thought about this matter, and I understood that
while two or three Congressites doubted, the mjority considered that he ought to go.
Mr. Gandhi did not commit himself to any clear decision as to whether he would go or
not, but my own very definite impression is that the failure of a communal settlement
will not in itself prevent his attendance.
(b)I asked him what he was going to do about Congress representatives at
the Conference and suggested that even if he went as the sole representative it would
be convenient to have available Congress representatives who could be appointed to
Sub-Committees, since even a Mahatma could not be in three places at once. He was
very vague about this part of the business and confessed that he had been so occupied
in local affairs in Gujarat that he had not had time to give consideration to the RoundVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        463Table Conference arrangements. The impression he gave was that he was very
reluctant to have anyone else as representing Congress in the picture and that he has
an idea that he can carry on alone coming in with his views at the final stage. He
obviously does not realize the amount of detailed discussion involved and the nature
and extent of the difficulties. On the other hand, he has no objection to Congressmen
being invited in their individual capacity to the Round Table Conference. I
specifically asked him this on a point raised by His Excellency when I last saw him.
In fact, he says that Lord Irwin had accepted this position and accordingly had invited
Malaviya, and he had indicated his intentions of also asking Mrs.Naidu and Dr.
Ansari. There would thus be, from Mr. Gandhi’s point of view, no objection in
inviting Congress Muslims as such, or indeed in inviting any Congress member in
any capacity other than as representative of Congress. This may assist in removing
difficulties which will almost certainly arise if Mr. Gandhi insists on being the sole
representative of the Congress.
(c)Another constitutional matter that Congress are now taking up is as to
whether—
(a)they should serve on Sub-Committee formed previous to the Round Table
Conference, and
(b)whether they should give evidence before such Committee.
I fancy this question was brought to a head by the resignation of AhmadShah
from the North-West Frontier Provinces Subjects Committee. Mr. Gandhi knew
nothing about his appointment or his resignation, and the latter was not, I think,
given under the orders of the Congress. It was probably given under the orders of
Abdul Ghaffar, and I gathered that Mr. Gandhi thought that Ahmad Shah should have
referred both his acceptance of the appointment and his resignation to the Congress.
He agreed that the case had not been in any way prejudged and that Ahmed Shah was
wrong in making this the ground for his resignation, but he did not think that
anything could now be done to put this right, although I gave him the opportunity of
suggesting a successor. In these circumstances he agreed that the best thing was to
leave the place vacant.
On the general question the Working Committee are to hold a meeting 
shortly. I very strongly urged that the decision should be in favour of co-opera-   tion
both as regards accepting places and giving evidence, and I said on my  own authority
that I thought there would be no difficulty, if the principle were  accepted, in asking
Congress to nominate members to Committees where the principle of Congress
representation was accepted by Government. Mr. Gandhi’s   doubt seemed to be as to
whether it was right to take part in Committees previous to the Round Table
Conference when he had not made up his mind about attendance at the Conference
himself. I pointed out that whatever might be his final decision in  regard to London,464      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIone important and main object of the Settlement would be   defeated if Congress did
not co-operate in constitutional matters, and that, even if for  any reason the Settle-
ment broke down, their present participation would not commit them. I am rather
afraid that the Working Committee will come to a wrong decision in this matter.
(d)The question of land revenue cropped up in several connection, e.g.,
Gujarat, U.P. and North-West Frontier Province. Mr. Gandhi did not attempt to press
the idea formerly favoured by him that Congress should act generally as an
intermediary between Government and the revenue payer, but he still seems to think
that it is possible for Congress to act as the friend of the landlord or tenant and advise
him on revenue and rent matters without coming into conflict with Government or
without causing serious embarrassment. He was impressed by the attitude I took on
the matter. I told him that there was no Government in the world that would allow a
political organization to come between them and the tax-payer, when their
intervention took the form of advice to the latter as to what taxes they should pay;
that if this was tried in Afghanistan, the agitator would be quickly put against the wall
and blown from the cannon; that in the Indian States he would be deported or
imprisoned; and that in the most advanced European countries the whole resources of
the Government would be used against an organized movement of this kind carried out
by a powerful political party. In India it was particularly necessary that agitation of
this kind should be avoided and the more so in existing economic conditions and
immediately after a direct campaign against rent and revenue. I made it quite clear that
personally I regarded activities, such as those in the U.P. as a very grave breach of the
whole spirit of the Settlement. I explained that local Governments were fully alive to
the gravity of the economic situation and the necessity of being lenient in land
revenue policy. Even so they had a very difficult task in deciding what the people
could pay and could not pay, and this task could only be complicated by the
interference of Congress, one result of which was to introduce the doubt as to whether
a person was refusing to pay land revenue because he genuinely could not pay or
because Congress advice had induced him to try and get off without payment. Mr.
Gandhi was not able to accept the idea of Congress standing aside from helping
persons in distress; but he did, I think, realize some of the difficulties in the way of
intervention, and so far as he himself is concerned, he is worried less by the thought
that inaction  will remove the great opportunity of getting at the rural masses than by
the failure   to do something for the oppressed. We have here a definite potential
source of trouble. On the other hand, he had no hesitation in condemning pressure
being brought   on landlords, direct appeals not to pay, creating false expectations on
the Congress creed of a 50 per cent reduction in revenue and generally of any refusal
to pay less than a person’s capacity to pay. The results of his forthcoming discussion
with Sir Malcolm Hailey ought to clear up the position in this respect.
(e)I attempted to give Mr. Gandhi an appreciation of the present situationVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        465in the various provinces and made special reference to the North-West Frontier
Provinces, Punjab, United Provinces, Bihar and Orissa and Bengal. I emphasized the
fact that some of the local Governments who had been satisfied with the early results
of the Settlement were getting apprehensive because of Congress activities. I pointed
out that difficulties were almost unprecedented—Constitutional, political, Commu-
nal, financial, agrarian and  terrorist—that we had a good chance of surmounting them
if everyone pulled together, but that otherwise the prospects were gloomy. I said it
was the deliberate and definite policy of the Government of India to implement the
Settlement and to make every effort within reason to prevent a break-down. There
were no reactionary forces at work in this respect. At the same time, they had
necessarily to exercise constant vigilance and they could not allow a situation of
danger to develop either generally or locally, even if action meant the disappearance
of the Settlement. In this respect the outstanding danger was the mentality of the
Congress and the constant advocacy, on the contrary, of preparation for a further
struggle. This mentality was inevitably having effects elsewhere. It was partly
because of the reaction in England and unless we could check the reaction there, the
atmosphere would become entirely unfavourable. In regard to constitutional
discussion at the Conference, I suggested that his own position would be very
unpleasant if, when he was in London, a state of affairs existed in India which irritated
and even outraged public opinion in England. I gave him many instances from
different provinces of Congress subversive action. Mr. Gandhi was, I think,
generally impressed by the above factor. He had already realized the significance of
the reaction in England and he did not, as I rather expected he might do, criticize the
reactionary forces at work. Similarly he made no protest whatever against the line
taken by His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab in his recent speech, and he
seemed to accept the view I took that the speech was the natural consequence of hard
facts for which Congress were largely responsible, but his only complaint was that I
had suggested a widespread suspicion of the objects and activities of the Congress,
that these in fact were good and that they did want a peaceful solution. He admitted
that particular activities were bad and had his complete disapproval.  He also
appreciated the necessity of getting the situation on to a more peaceful plane, and  he
will, I hope, definitely use his influence to this end. I showed him a circular  issued by
the Provincial Congress Committee of Madras, a copy of which is attached   to this
note, and said that while there were one or two things in it which might   be better
expressed, Government would have little cause for complaint if Congress as a whole
acted on the principles stated in it. I also told him that the line he had taken in his
own speech at Simla would definitely help, and begged him to carry on in the same
spirit and get his leaders to do likewise. I have personally no doubt that he will do his
best.
12.I may close this note (which is already of inordinate length) with some466      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIpersonal impressions.
Mr. Gandhi is, I think, more sincere than ever in his desire to see the
Settlement through, and he will do his utmost in this respect. It is probably less
likely to break down from the Congress side on a big issue than on some irritating
and comparatively unimportant matter of detail. This danger would be lessened if
Congress activities, especially in rural areas, were materially to moderate, for it
might then be possible and even desirable for local Government to stretch a point
here and there in response to Congress action. If and when this becomes feasible, the
atmosphere will improve.
Mr. Gandhi himself has definitely mellowed during the past few months. He
has been up against concrete difficulties and has had to face constructive work. This
has made him less confident in regard to preconceived ideas and more ready to see the
other side of the case, although I have always found him very fair in this respect.
Personal contact with various officers of Government has increased his desire to co-
operate and while I realize only too well the difficulties and dangers in the way of
closer co-operation with Congress leaders so long as Congress are out to increase
their prestige and influence at the expense of Government and other parties, I feel
that, where it is possible to avoid these difficulties and dangers, personal contact will
definitely help to relieve the situation. This will be particularly the case if, as I hope,
Mr. Gandhi tries with success to tone down the war mentality. If there is no response
by Government, we shall get back into the same vicious circle.
Mr. Gandhi himself is at present too involved in detail to give the attention he
should be giving to big questions. He receives many complaints of failure on the part
of Government to carry out their part of the agreement, and although the great
majority of these are untrue, they doubts and suspicions. The sooner the matters
immediately arising out of the Settlement are would up the better.
Mr. Gandhi is under no illusion as to the consequences of the break-down of
the Settlement. He realizes the renewal of the Civil Disobedience Movement will
compel Government to hit hard and hit at once and I have made this perfectly clear to
him on many occasions. He accepts this as quite fair and will, if necessary, face the
consequences. But if it can be avoided, he does not want another fight and this fact
and his sense of obligation to honour promises given to Lord Irwin are factors of very
great importance in the situation.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY’S NOTE ON DISCUSSIONS WITH GANDHIJI11
May 20, 1931
My discussion with Mr. Gandhi today turned mainly on the agrarian situation,
but there were also some subsidiary points mentioned.
1. As regards releases, he had little to say; he had not at all events come
prepared with a list of cases in which there were any complaints that we had not
observed the Agreement. I told him that if there were any cases which he wished to
refer to us, I should be glad if he would send them to Chief Secretary; and he agreed.
2.He mentioned the cases of students who had been rusticated, etc., for
taking part in Civil Disobedience. I have not the full facts, but the D.P.I. has
informed me that before being re-admitted they were required to undertake that they
were to observe the disciplinary rules of the institution. This does not seem to be a
very onerous obligation, and failing any more definite complaint from Congress, I
would let the matter rest there. Mr. Gandhi did not seem to attach any great
importance to it at the time.
3.He attached some importance to the question of arms for which licenses
had been confiscated owing to their owners taking part in Civil Disobedience. There
were I believe some such cases, though I do not now if we have anything about them
at headquarters. He told me that the Commissioner in Gujarat had recognized that this
fell within the terms of the Agreement, that Mr. Emerson had said he thought it did
so, but that he would consult legal opinion before issuing anything to local
Governments. Chief Secretary might ascertain any facts that he can on the subject,
and at the same time write demi-officially to Mr. Emerson, asking if the Government
of India think that arms licenses should be restored, where they have been confiscated
strictly on the ground that owners have taken part in Civil Disobediences.
4.As I have said, the main point was the agrarian situation. We discussed 
this at great length, and I for my part avoided any point of principle, such as whethere
the Congress was really entitled under the Agreement to be recognized as the
,representative  of  the people, etc., and too him at once to the facts of the situation
in the  districts in which Congress had been  most  active.  I  pointed out that however
the situation had been arrived at, the danger was that tenants would now refuse  to pay
rents  at all and resort to acts of violence if they were pressed by l andlords.   I
naturally  quoted  Chauri  Chaura  to  him.   He at  once  dis-  claimed any idea of a no-
1 Vide “Speech at Nainital”, 20-5-1931468      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIrent campaign, and was somewhat aghast when I gave him a copy of the resolution of
the Etawah Congress Committee which he said he would look into at once. He
admitted that where compromises had been made by landlords with Congress, the
latter had not been able to persuade tenants to pay up. He said it was no part of
Congress plans to establish an organization of tahsils and thanas; they were quite
opposed to the idea of actually starting a parallel government or anything of the
kind. Having got thus far, I then again but to him the actual difficulty arising from the
situation in these districts. He said that it could only be solved by enlisting the
effective co-operation of Congress in persuading tenants to pay their rents. But he
could not promise this, nor could he engage to use his own active efforts of
persuasion direct to tenants unless Congress had something better to put forward than
the mere announcement of remissions by Government. His workers had narrowly
examined the conditions of numerous districts and were confident that tenants could
not pay even the reduced rentals in present circumstances. He indeed suggested that
the enquiry showed that rents were so high as practically to be unpayable even in
ordinary years, though he admitted that this conclusion might need some modifying
in the light of the fact that many of these rentals were old and spread over a long
series of years. He suggested the adoption of one of the three following courses :
First, (though he did not press this) he suggested that we might accept the
figures arrived at by Congress workers, which he assured me were not a mere rough
shot but the result of actual inquiries. I pointed out to him that it was quite impossible
to assume that these general figures were equally correct for all classes of tenants and
for all parts of the province.
Secondly, he suggested that our officers might hold a kind of summary inquiry
with selected Congressmen in each district or division with a view of getting better
figures.
Thirdly, if neither course was acceptable to Government, he asked that
Government itself should hold a public inquiry at which Congressmen could give
evidence as to the capacity of tenants to pay rentals. I pointed out to him that either
of the latter courses would mean delay with every prospect that no money would be
available at all for payment of rentals. If tenants get over the payment of any rental at
all this harvest, it is pretty certain that they would pay nothing for kharif. It was quite
impossible   to make summary inquiries in three or four days as he thought, and a
general  inquiry on the lines of that which he had in mind, namely, the Commission
on Champaran in 1916 would take many months. Anything that we did now would not
only very gravely affect the landlords, but also might have an abiding effect on our
own finances for many years to come; it was not, therefore, reasonable to askVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        469Government to adopt a summary p rocedure  which might have such far-reaching
effects. I told him that I would consider his proposals, but it seemed to me that the
result of delaying collections would be so dangerous that  it  would  be  difficult  to
accept them. I pointed out that there were many districts in which our officers thought
that collections might now proceed without great difficulty, and that in my opinion
the best course was to set to work on collections wherever possible in the hope that if
these proceeded smoothly it will have its effect on the attitude of the tenants
generally. We left the matter at that, and it may be that it is not a very satisfactory
conclusion, for I did not get his definite engagement to do nothing except to
discountenance anything like a no-rent campaign or an attempt to set up Congress
tribunals. As Mr. Emerson had warned me, Mr. Gandhi feels deeply that Congress
cannot entirely retire from its position of championship of tenants and small
landowners.
5.We discussed the question of picketing though at no great length. I
pointed out to him the danger that it was becoming communal owing to the
unwillingness of volunteers to tackle Mohammedan shopkeepers, and I also pointed
out that the snatching away of liquor or the infliction of fines is quite beyond the
spirit of the Agreement. Here is agreed and said that he would do his best to
discountenance it and had indeed already issued orders against the taking of fines.

MY DEAR EMERSON,
Many thanks for your letter of the 16th May; I have found it very useful indeed
in my discussion with Mr. Gandhi. I send you a note as to the results which, I fear,
were not very conspicuous. But the discussion was very friendly throughout, and I was
particularly struck with the fact that he did not seem to have come prepared to open up
a battery of objections against our method of dealing with releases, ect. As you will
see, his general attitude on the object of the agrarian trouble was very much the same
as that which he took with you.
Yours sincerely,

LETTER FROM SIR MALCOLM HAILEY2
May 23, 1931
DEAR MR. GANDHI,
I have just received your letter of today, and as you ask for a very early, I have
given it urgent but very anxious consideration and write at once to give you my views
on the subject.
Thought I welcome much that is contained in your proposed manifesto, such as
the advice to tenants to begin making payments at once, your condemnation of the
use of violence by kisans, and your strongly expressed desire that they should not
injure their own cause by undersirable action, yet I much regret that I could not
associate myself in any way with the manifesto as a whole. It practically embodies a
decision that it is necessary to make for a large number of districts in the province a
rental remission for the whole year 1338 Fasli of eight annas in the rupee in the case
1 Vide“Speech at Nainital”, 20-5-1931
2 Vide “Letter to Malcolm Hailey”, 23-5-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        471of statutory and non-occupancy tenants and four annas in the case of occupancy
tenants. Though I admit that it is stated that in some cases a larger payment is
possible, yet tenants generally could not understand it as anything but a direction to
confine their payments to this level as a whole. I am myself far from convinced by
anything that I have seen or heard that a reduction on this scale is required by the
circumstances, and I am certainly clear that no one formula, whether it embraces
reductions of this amount or otherwise, could with equity be applied to the very
different conditions pevailing throughout the province.
I am advised that collections of rentals are already proceeding in many of our
districts on the basis of the reductions made by Government, and though it is not
possible at the moment to say whether these collections can everywhere be made
absolutely in  full, yet to my mind the right policy is to allow collections to proceed
on this basis  and to watch the results carefully. I have in conversation with you
pointed out the   danger of doing anything which would encourage tenants to withhold
rentals at this   stage, for if collections are not made at once, there will be little
chance of securing  any payment at all at a subsequent stage. It is for this latter reason
in particular     that I have deprecated proposals for general inquiries into the present
pitch of rentals throughout the province, for no summary inquiry of this nature can do
justice to a  very complicated and involved case, a decision on which will not only
affect vitally the finances of Government, but will involve far-reaching effects on the
relations of tenants and landlords.
With best wishes,
I am,
Yours sincerely,
M. HAILEY

LETTER FROM SIR MALCOLM HAILEY TO H. W. EMERSON1
UNITED PROVINCES ,
May 23, 1931
MY DEAR EMERSON,
I think that you ought to see at once the enclosed correspondence I have just
had with Mr. Gandhi. I had to reply at somewhat short notice, as I did not wish to do
anything that might delay him leaving us at 3 o’clock this afternoon! But it was
clearly impossible for me to agree to anything that would look like a joint manifesto
from myself and him, particularly as his draft could only have been understood by the
majority of people to embody a decision that the remissions granted by us were
altogether wrong and that something far more extensive was required. I do not know if
he will return to the charge or will want to come and see me again; but his lieutenant,
Govind Vallabh Pant, was told on the telephone that I should be unlikely to vary the
attitude I had taken up. After a good deal of consideration I think this is only one
possible for me.
Yours sincerely,

LETTER FROM R. M. MAXWELL 2
GOVERNMENT HOUSE,
MAHABALESHWAR ,
May 13, 1931
DEAR MR. GANDHI,
At your interview with His Excellency Sir Frederick Sykes on the 17th April
His Excellency promised that certain cases which you mentiioned, pertaining to the
Home Department, would be reconsidered by the Government.  I am now to inform
you of the results of that review.
1 Vide “Letter to Malcolm Hailey”, 23-5-1931
2 Vide “Letter to R. M. Maxwell”, 6-6-1931VOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        4732.I am to deal firstly with your suggestions for the release of certain
prisoners.
(i)You represented that the Sholapur Martial Law prisoners who had not
been released should have been released according to the Settlement, and you were
informed at the time that there were three such persons.
In the case of Mr. Rajwade you are right in your supposition, to which you
have referred in your letter of the 1st instant to Mr. Collins, that no other writing was
placed before the Court except the issue of the Karmayogi  in question. Many of the
allegations in that document were either false or so grossly exaggerated (or, when he
referred to the incidents of the riots, minimized) as to be untrue to the facts. The chief
consideration, however, is that their publication at that time and in the conditions
then prevailing in Sholapur inevitably tended to inflame the population against the
authorities and thus amounted to a direct and real incitement to further violence. Their
actual effect was to make more difficult the restoration of peace, and it is impossible
to doubt that this result was foreseen by Mr. Rajwade when he published the article.
The Government, therefore, on reconsideration adhere to their view that this is not a
case which can properly claim the benefit of the amnesty.
The other two persons were convicted of tampering with justice by bribing
witnesses in the case which arose from the murder of two policemen, and on
reconsideration Government are unable to see that the Settlement can apply to a case
of this description or that the persons concerned deserve any clemency.
(ii) The Government have reconsidered the cases of persons convicted   
under Section  124-A  of  the I.P.C. You expressed the opinion  that  the writing  of
articles  and  the  making  of  speeches  were  not  contemplated  when i t  was  decided
that the Settlement should not apply to cases of violence and incitement to violence.
The Government are unable to accept this view, for it is clear that such writings and
speeches can, and often did, contain incitement to violence which is real and not
technical, and that such incitement is often more dangerous and far-reaching than
other forms of incitement to violence. The Government find that the cases of the
individuals detained in jail satisfied this test, and they are therefore in no doubt that
those persons were rightly excluded from the benefits of the amnesty. I am to add that
Government are always ready to show leniency, as in many cases in the past, to any
person convicted under Section 124-A of the I.P.C., who makes adequate apologies
and gives an undertaking not to repeat the offence but this is a point unconnected
with the Settlement, which makes no provision for conditional release.
(iii)You referred to the case of Ratanji Dayaram of Bardoli taluka, who you
said was convicted of burning his own crop and should therefore have been released.
On examining his case Government find that he was convicted of deliberately
burning his tenant’s crop in order that the revenue due to Government should not be474      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIpaid on the land in question. He has not made any reparation to the sufferer which
might have entitled his case to consideration on grounds of clemency as distinct from
the terms of the Settlement, which, as I have pointed out, make no provision for
conditional release. Apart from this circumstance, Government consider that violent
mischief of this description does not come within the terms of the amnesty.
(iv)His Excellency understood you to say that there were certain prisoners
convicted of offences in connection with the salt campaign who had not been
released. The Home Department are however unable to trace any such cases.
(v)You stated that there were certain prosecutions which were still being 
carried on for offences which took place during the civil disobedience campaign
contrary to the terms of the Settlement, and you referred in particular to a case in
Belgaum.
It was pointed out to you at the time that the particular case to which you
referred was a case of Nipani in that district. The facts of this case are that, following
the conviction of two local leaders in April 1930, a mob collected with the intention
of enforcing hartal, and after damaging public and private property and destroying the
royal portraits in the school, came into conflict with the police whom they proceeded
to stone, with the result that three policemen and some village servants were injured.
There was thus real violence and Government feel that the decision to proceed with
the case cannot be altered.
The other prosecutions which were still pending at the time of your 
conversation with His Excellency were those of (a) Mahadev Kuverji and Hira Vallabh
(b) Vishnu Sali, (c) Shiva Mattur,  all of S urat district, who were accused respectively
of setting fire to attached crops, severely assaulting a police constable, and setting
fire to an attached crop after beating the village servant in charge. These are clear
cases of violence which cannot be reviewed.
3.As regards the orders of deportation passed under the Foreigners’ Act,
the Government have already, on reconsideration, withdrawn these orders in all cases,
six in number, and the persons who were in prison for failing to observe the orders
have been released. In this connection you stated that there were 30 such cases in the
Karnatak and you were informed that Government were not aware of them, on which
you agreed to furnish particulars of them to the Secretary, Home Department. As you
have not done so, His Excellency assumes that you were misinformed on the point.
4.You stated that certain movable and immovable property forfeited had
not been returned. His Excellency finds that all the buildings seized under Ordinance
IX have been restored. The delay in some cases was due to the time which necessarily
elapsed in finding, and making the necessary arrangements with, the persons entitled
and authorized to take delivery.
As regards the return of movable property, the position has been discussed inVOL. 52 : 28 APRIL, 1931 - 1 JULY, 1931                                                                        475my separate letter of today, in reply to yours of the 7th May.
5.As regards the Chirner case, which you represented should be withdrawn,
you were informed at the time that as the persons concerned were accused of rioting,
being armed with deadly weapons, dacoity, conspiracy to commit dacoity and causing
grievous hurt to public servants in the performance of their duty, while six of them
are directly charged with murder, the case was obviously one shich must be allowed to
take its course.

OPINION1
June 13, 1931
1.(1) The question which has arisen between the Government and the
Navajivan Press is :
“What are the obligations of the Government as regards returning the    press
which was seized at Ahmedabad from the premises of the Navajivan Press?” The
question depends primarily on the language of the Instrument which says “movable
property . . . will be returned”. The meaning of the word “return” as given by Webster
is “to bring, carry, put, or send back; to restore”. According to Murray’s Oxford
Dictionary the word “return” has, among others, the following meaning :
“to bring or convey to a place or person; to send bac again; to give or render
back”. From this it is plain that where a party in possession (in this case the
Government) has agreed to return a movable property, the obligation undertaken can
only be said to have been performed when the party in possession brings or conveys
back to the place from where the thing was taken and hands it over to the person from
whom it was taken. We are, therefore, of opinion that the terms of the Agreement are
not only not silent as to the place of delivery, but are clear as to the place of delivery,
viz., the place from where it was taken or where it was seized.
2.In an Indian Statute, the word “return” has also been used in the sense of
taking a thing back to the place from which it was brought. Section 43 of the Indian
Sale of Goods Act runs as follows :
“Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are delivered to the buyer and he refuses
1 Vide “Letter to H.W. Emerson”, 14-6-1931476      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIto accept them, having the right so to do, he is not to return them to the seller, but it
is sufficient if he intimates to the seller that he refuses to accept them”.
It is obvious that the word “return” must mean taking bac to the place from
which it was taken, and it is used in contradistinction to “offer to return” or “holding
it at the disposal of the party from whom it was taken”. The action of the Government
in this case merely amounts to “offer to return” or to “hold it at the disposal of the
previous owner”, but does not amount to the performance of the obligation to return.
As is pointed out above, the obligation to return requires that the thing should be
restored to the place and the person from which and from whom it was taken.
3.We are of opinion that the section dealing with the subject of delivery of
goods as between the seller and the buyer, has got nothing to do with the present
question as no question of return arises in such a case.
4.While clearly disagreeing with the view that the agreement in question
is silent as to the place of “return”, we are of opinion that even in that view, the place
of performance of the obligation, in an agreement like the present, is the place from
or at which the thing was taken or seized. The place in such a case has to be
determined by a reference to the object of the agreement. It is clear that in this case,
the object is to restore status quo ante .
5.Even on the assumption, which is denied, that the agreement in this 
present case is silent as to the place of “return”, by reason of the provisions of 
Section 49 of the Indian Contract Act, if no place of performance was       agreed upon,
the promisee has the right to appoint the place of performance     and the promisor is
bound to perform the promise (in this case, the promise to return   the press) at such
place, provided it is reasonable. In this case, the promisee is entitled to name a
reasonable place for performance and the reasonable and proper place is prima facie
the place from where it was taken or where it was seized; for it is conceivable that
after the seizure, the thing may be removed, for a variety of reasons, to a distant place
and it would be clearly reasonable for the promisee to claim that it should be returned
to the place from where it was taken or where it was seized.
6.In every view of the matter, therefore, the position taken up by the
Government in the matter of the Navajivan Press cannot be sustained. They can be
said to have fulfilled the agreement only when they have taken it to Ahmedabad (from
where it was seized) and offer to return it to the person from whom it was taken.

LETTER FROM H. W. EMERSON1
SIMLA,
July 4, 1931
In your letter of June 14, you suggested that the time had perhaps arrived for
the appointment of a permanent Board of Arbitration to decide questions of the
interpretation of the Settlement and as to the full carrying out of the terms by the one
party or the other. Again in your letter of June 20, you made the farther suggestion
that in regard to picketing, the Government of India should advise local Governments
to appoint a Board of Inquiry, consisting of a nominee on their behalf and a nominee
on behalf of the Congress, to conduct a summary inquiry into the allegations on
either side and wherever it is found that the rule of peaceful picketing has been
violated picketing should be entirely suspended, the Government undertaking on its
part to stop prosecutions wherever it is found that they have been undertaken in spite
of peaceful picketing.
I much appreciate your object of removing the possible causes of dispute
arising out of the Settlement, but there are, I am afraid, serious difficulties in the way
of accepting either proposal. To take the lesser one first. Its scope, as I understand it,
is mainly limited to cases in which it is alleged that the methods of picketing have
contravened the ordinary law and that the police have, therefore, prosecuted or
propose to prosecute the picketer. One effect of your proposal would be that before
bringing the law into operation there should be a summary inquiry carried out by a
nominee of Government and a nominee of Congress and that further proceedings
would depend on their decision.
In other words, the duty of maintaining the law in this particular respect would
be transferred from the police, who have statutory duties, to a Board of Inquiry, the
members of which might well arrive at different conclusions.
While the police, of course, must act only in accordance with the law, it is not
practicable nor was it intended by the Settlement that their duty in this respect should
in any way be abrogated.
In cases of this kind a practical test as to whether the law has or has not been
contravened is the decision of the Court, which tries the case, and unless its decision
is reversed on appeal the finding of the Court that picketing has contravened the law
and consequently the terms of the Settlement should prima facie be followed
automatically by a suspension of picketing. The above illustrates one of the
difficulties, that would also arise in the case of Standing Boards of Arbitration.
         1 Vide “Letter to J. H. Garrett”, 20-4-1931478      THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHIThe obligations imposed on Congress by the Settlement relate largely to
matters affecting Law and Order, the freedom of action of the individual and the
carrying on of the administration, that is to say, any serious breach of it has
important reactions on one or other of these matters. So far as individual breaches
contravened the ordinary law, the position would be the same as for picketing. If
general breaches of it raised questions of policy affecting Law and Order or the
effective working of the administration, it would be clearly impossible for
Government to restrict their freedom of action by reference to a Board of Arbitration.
This was not contemplated when the Settlement was made and in particular when the
last clause of it was drafted. Nor would it be consonant with the discharge by
Government of fundamental responsibilities.
It seems to me that the working of the Settlement must depend primarily on
the good faith of the parties to it. So far as Government are concerned they desire to
adhere strictly to its terms and our information shows that the local Governments
have been scrupulous in carrying out the obligations imposed on them. Doubtful
cases are of course inevitable, but local Governments are prepared to give them most
careful examination and the Government of India will continue to bring to the notice
of local Governments any cases that are reported to them and if necessary satisfy
themselves in regard to the facts.
